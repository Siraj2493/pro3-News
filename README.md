Summary

Team members: Jerome Pelham, Deirdre Clark, Sirajuddin Pirzada, Heather Saul

Our team is interested in using data analysis tools to look at potential associations between standard news outlet coverage of events and stock market behavior. In this case we will be focusing on Coronavirus as our primary query. 

Utilizing stock API, news API, and social media sharing API, the website will allow users to interact with a dashboard that presents stock market behavior by date interval, with options to look at different stock indexes and markets. The date interval will then determine a cascade of news analysis by source (CNN, Fox News, Al-Jazeera, Business Insider etc.). 

Once the user chooses a source, news media will be analyzed by: 1) topic (the titles and number of articles that mention Coronavirus published by a news source); 2) social media penetration (the amount of shares for the articles on different social media platforms); 3) keywords (a natural language processing analysis of the articles from a news source); 4) sentiment analysis (a natural language processing of article positivity/negativity from a news source). 

The news media analysis will paint a global picture for users who are interested in looking at possible associations between news coverage and various stock market behavior. If we have time, we would like to add features that could compare news sources over the same date intervals, and even create a non-conventional graph that might reflect news sentiment on a ribbon chart with stock fluctuations.
