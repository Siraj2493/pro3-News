As you can see, they were quite dirty.\n\nThen, I put on a liberal dose of Purell hand sanitizer. (In order to make sure hand sanitizer does its temporary job, you need almost a teaspoon of it, according to the American Council on Science and Health.)\n\nWith that, the germs cleared up quite a bit. However, hand sanitizer does not remove bacteria (as hand soap does). It simply neutralizes the bacteria, but leaves it on your hand, allowing it to resurge later.\n\nThe most striking photo was the final one, after I lathered my hands for 20 seconds and rinsed for five to 10 seconds. It's the photo that glows the least, because there are so few germs for the Glo-Germ to cling to.\n\nResearch has long-shown that hand-washing isn't a given for everyone.\n\nAn international study in 2014, led by UK researchers, found 19% of people wash their hands with soap after coming into contact with feces.\n\nHealth officials insist it's imperative we turn those numbers around - according to recent research by MIT increasing hand-washing at just 10 airports in the US would reduce the spread of the coronavirus by 60 percent.\n\nAnd yet, Insider Data conducted a poll last month which found that while many people are washing their hands more, there is a significant gender gap: of the 1,000 people surveyed, 65% of women said they were taking more care to wash their hands, compared to 52% of men.\n\nA useful way to keep your hand-washing on track is to sing a song in your head (or out loud), and only stopping when you've finished.\n\nThe classic is to sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice. But on Monday, Insider compiled a list of other songs you can scrub to, including \"Jolene\" and \"Raspberry Beret.\"\n\nAnd remember, even after the song is over, take the time to dry your hands thoroughly - new germs flourish in moisture.\n\nAbout our polling: SurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender.

SurveyMonkey Audience doesn't try to weigh its sample based on race or income.

lose their flight slots if they keep their planes on the ground.\n\nDemand for flights has collapsed across the globe amid growing fears about the outbreak.\n\nUnder Europe's rules, airlines operating out of the continent must continue to run 80% of their allocated slots or risk losing them to a competitor.\n\nThis has led to some operators flying empty planes into and out of European countries at huge costs, The Times of London reported.\n\nOn Thursday, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wrote to Airport Coordination Limited asking for the rules to be suspended during the outbreak to prevent further environmental and economic damage.\n\n\"I am particularly concerned that, in order to satisfy the 80/20 rule, airlines may be forced to fly aircraft at very low load factors, or even empty, in order to retain their slots,\" Shapps wrote.\n\n\"Such a scenario is not acceptable. It is not in the industry's, the passengers' or the environment's interest and must be avoided.\"\n\nACL has already suspended the rules for flights to and from Hong Kong and mainland China. However, they remain for all other flights.\n\nOn Thursday, the UK airline Flybe went into administration, a practice similar to filing for bankruptcy protection, though it said its financial problems existed long before the outbreak.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association has estimated that the outbreak could wipe out up to $113 billion in airline sales worldwide.", "source": {"uri":

sick workers to get reimbursed for their time off, in an effort to fight the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe grocery chain is encouraging employees who have symptoms or do not feel well to stay home until they have been symptom-free for at least 24 hours, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"Since we want to reinforce this guideline, through April 15, your Captain has discretion to approve a reimbursement of AR [absence reserve, or sick leave and paid time off] for Crew Members who are unable to work due to respiratory illness,\" the memo reads. \"Crew Members that are required to miss more than a full calendar week (7-day period) of work due to respiratory illness will have their personal situation reviewed by HR.\"\n\nThe memo instructs workers to alert a Captain (Trader Joe's term for manager) or Mates (coworkers) if they become sick during the workday, in order to be sent home immediately. Workers were instructed to familiarize themselves with symptoms of \"many cold, flu, and other viruses (including COVID-19),\" such as coughing, sneezing, fever, and shortness of breath.\n\n\"If you develop a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath, call your health-care provider right away,\" the memo states. \"We are encouraging Crew who are exhibiting any of the above symptoms to see a medical provider and not come to work.\"\n\nCompany limitations on taking sick leave could result in people reporting to work with symptoms, to avoid punishment or lack of payment. By giving workers more freedom to take time off, Trader Joe's new policy could help prevent the spread of illness among workers, as well as shoppers.\n\nOne Trader Joe's worker expressed concern to Business Insider regarding the fact that absence reserve will only be reimbursed at the manager's discretion. The worker was granted anonymity in order to speak frankly about the situation, but their identity was confirmed by Business Insider. It also, potentially, signals to worried Trader Joe's customers that the chain is being more proactive in preventing the spread of the illness than competitors.\n\n\"For new or part-time crew members who don't qualify for health insurance, there's nothing about them covering healthcare expenses,\" the employee said. \"So, the risk is still really high and we still just have to hope none of us get sick.\"\n\nTrader Joe's did not respond to Business Insider's inquiry on whether it will cover health care costs for part-time or new employees seeking medical attention.\n\nThe memo instructs workers on personal hygiene, telling them to cover a cough or sneeze with a tissue or elbow, avoid touching their faces, and frequently and properly wash their hands. Workers have been instructed to continue routine cleaning, with no additional disinfection at this point.\n\nTrader Joe's is also tweaking its free sample practices, with workers serving samples directly to customers and using a fork or spoon so customers do not have to use their hands to eat the sample.\n\nPeople working in the service industry are some of the jobs most at risk during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a Business Insider analysis of US Labor Department data.\n\nAccording to Marissa Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Washington Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences department, hourly workers and employees who cannot work from home will face difficult decisions that could put them in danger.\n\n\"Do I stay home if I feel ill, or go into work so I can have a paycheck? What do I do if my child's school is closed, and I can't afford to stay off work?\" Baker said.\n\nMany retailers, including Target, are not offering workers additional sick leave despite coronavirus concerns. Adam Ryan, the liaison for the employee activist group Target Workers Unite and a current employee at a store in Christiansburg, Virginia, recently told Business Insider's Shoshy Ciment that he feels too worried to take an unpaid sick day.\n\n\"Even missing one day has a huge impact,\" Ryan said, regarding how he does not get paid time off or paid sick time.", "source": {"uri":

true number was \"a fraction of 1%.\"\n\n\"Well, I think the 3.4% is really a false number,\" Trump said. \"Now, this is just my hunch, but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people who do this, because a lot of people will have this and it's very mild. They'll get better very rapidly.

It was an increase from 2% previously and is likely to change further.\n\nAs Business Insider previously reported, \"experts predict that the percentage of deaths will decrease in the longer term since milder cases of COVID-19 are probably going undiagnosed.\" While that aligns with Trump's reasoning on Wednesday, it's unclear where he came up with the \"fraction of 1%\" alternative.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the global death toll from the coronavirus neared 3,300, with more than 95,000 confirmed cases around the world.\n\nThe US has had 11 deaths so far -- 10 in Washington state and one in California -- with more than 150 reported cases. Because of a shortage of coronavirus testing kits, however, the US has not been testing for the virus as much as several other countries.\n\nTrump later speculated in the interview that \"thousands or hundreds of thousands\" of people might have recovered from the virus without receiving a diagnosis, which would be a dramatic increase from the fewer than 100,000 cases that have been confirmed for far.\n\nA representative from the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_frias@businessinsider.com", "name": "Lauren Frias", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sarah_al_arshani@businessinsider.com", "name": "Sarah Al-Arshani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Hannity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tedros Adhanom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e607142fee23d394b6cc202?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5569799", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "shares": {"facebook": 13015, "pinterest": 9}, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 13024, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1472351468", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-05", "time": "17:02:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-05T17:02:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-05T17:01:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-drops-out-2020-presidential-race-2020-2", "title": "Elizabeth Warren plans to drop out of the 2020 presidential race", "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is dropping out of the 2020 Democratic primary, according to The New York Times, after she failed to place higher than third in any race so far. Warren surged in national polls last summer and fall, racking up support with a policy-focused campaign that appealed to well-educated white progressives. But she ultimately failed to break through as a top candidate for Democratic voters, who have largely favored Sen. Bernie Sanders or former Vice President Joe Biden. With Warren out of the race, the contest has narrowed to Biden and Sanders, pitting the insurgent, populist left against the establishment-backed center of the party. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is planning to drop out of the 2020 Democratic primary, The New York Times first reported Thursday.\n\nWarren's decision comes after she failed to place higher than third in any primary or caucus so far in the race. In a particularly devastating blow, she came in third in her home state of Massachusetts on Super Tuesday, behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator's campaign aides hinted at her upcoming dropout on Wednesday, with one aide telling multiple media outlets that she was \"assessing the path forward.\"\n\nWarren's campaign manager, Roger Lau, also put out a statement acknowledging that the campaign \"fell well short of our viability goals and projections\" and was \"disappointed\" in the results from Super Tuesday.\n\n\"All of us have worked for Elizabeth long enough to know that she isn't a lifetime politician and doesn't think like one,\" Lau said. \"She's going to take time right now to think through the right way to continue this fight.\"\n\nSticking to one of her signature slogans - \"nevertheless, she persisted\" - Warren tried to position herself as a \"unity candidate,\" with the goal of picking up enough delegates on Super Tuesday to make it to the Democratic National Convention.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider De symptomen van griep en het nieuwe coronavirus lijken op elkaar, maar het sterftecijfer bij het coronavirus is veel hoger\n\nBut Warren's dismal performance on Tuesday left her lagging far behind the competition in delegates and undermined her campaign's strategy for staying in the race.\n\nFoto: Sen.

Source: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nWarren, 70, rose in national polls over the summer and fall, building her support with a policy-focused campaign that appealed to well-educated white progressives. She was viewed for several months as a frontrunner in the race.\n\nMost of Warren's supporters - about 68% - said their second choice candidate was Sanders, according to Insider polling, so the Vermont democratic socialist is hoping for a boost as Warren leaves the race. But many of Warren's fans also like Biden and could shift their support to his camp.\n\nIn November, The New York Times and Siena College released a set of polls showing Warren would lose to Trump by three and six points among registered voters in three key battleground states - Michigan, North Carolina, and Florida - and would tie with the president in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nBoth Biden and Sanders fared better than Warren in the same general election matchups.\n\nWarren ultimately failed to emerge as the top candidate in any one lane. Sanders dominated progressive voters, former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar came out ahead among voters seeking unity, and Klobuchar took an edge among voters looking for a female candidate.\n\nFoto: Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Source: Associated Press 'I've got a plan for that'\n\nWarren ran on a long list of far-reaching, comprehensive policy proposals, including universal day care, debt-free college and free public college.\n\nWhile Sanders made his case for a \"political revolution,\" Warren, who's called herself \"a capitalist to my bones,\" pushed for structural change.\n\nShe argued that, unlike Sanders, she's relatively new to Washington and politics, having run for office for the first time in 2012. At the same time, she also made the case that she knows how to get things done in DC.\n\nWarren emphasized her anti-corruption proposals, and would have sought lobbying bans for top government officials, new executive branch conflict-of-interest laws, and a ban on stock trading for members of Congress and other top officials, among other ethics reforms.\n\nBut Warren lost some momentum amid questions about her stance on Medicare for All, a key policy that has significant support among progressive voters, which she has hesitantly endorsed.\n\nFoto: Sen.

Source: Mary Schwalm/Reuters Sanders and Biden jockey for Warren's backing amid a brutal primary season\n\nWarren and Sanders are longtime friends who have championed the progressive agenda. They made an unofficial pact not to go to war with one another during the primary contest, but that deal blew up amid reports in January that Sanders told Warren during a private meeting shortly before she launched her campaign that he didn't think a woman couldn't win the presidency\n\nWarren's campaign initially declined to comment on the reports, but the Massachusetts senator later confirmed them, adding that she had \"no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences in punditry.\"\n\nStill, the development sent shockwaves through the political and media spheres and the two senators clashed during a primary debate in Iowa the next day.\n\nBut the two campaigns appear to be reconciling. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday evening that top allies and surrogates linked to both campaigns were discussing how to unite their camps and push a common liberal, progressive agenda after Warren's disappointing showing on Super Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the Post, lawmakers who support Sanders' campaign began reaching out on Wednesday to people in Warren's camp to gauge her willingness to endorse the Vermont senator. They also reportedly began appealing to Warren's supporters to throw their support behind Sanders as he gets ready to duke it out with Biden in a series of critical upcoming primaries.\n\nBiden's camp, meanwhile, has also been in talks with Warren's associates about joining forces if she drops out, the Post reported.\n\nAccording to Insider's polling, 70.5% of Warren's supporters would be satisified if Sanders were the Democratic nominee, and 55.6% would be satisifed with Biden. Conversely, just 15.6% of her supporters would be dissatisfied if Sanders were the nominee, while nearly twice that numbers, 27.4% would be dissatisfied if it were Biden.\n\nJake Lahut contributed to

The virus passes primarily through saliva and mucus, which can travel from a person's nose or mouth about 3 to 5 feet, depending on the size of the droplet. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSix feet. That's how far the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests you stay from anyone who might be sick.\n\nThe agency is recommending that people avoid \"close contact\" with anyone showing flu-like symptoms. Specifically, the CDC defines close contact as \"being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time.\"\n\nThat's because the viral particles travel between people in tiny droplets or saliva and mucus, which typically spread 3 to 5 feet. If a sick person sneezes, coughs, or eats within that distance of someone healthy, the particles could land on them; if the particles enter the person's eyes, nose, or mouth, the person can become infected.\n\nIn the past, infection-control professionals have defined \"close contact\" as 3 feet - that was the CDC's recommended distance for people during the SARS outbreak. But the agency has doubled that for the coronavirus, since it is possible for droplets to travel up to 6 feet.\n\nHow the coronavirus spreads\n\nScientists think the new coronavirus is carried in liquid droplets more than 5 micrometers in diameter. The common cold, which is also a coronavirus, travels in these big, wet droplets, too.\n\nScientists aren't sure whether the coronavirus also travels in smaller, drier droplets known as aerosols (which are less than 5 micrometers in diameter). Aerosols remain airborne for longer because of their size and are usually inhaled. Tuberculosis and measles are mainly transmitted through aerosols. Even if the coronavirus does travel in aerosols, though, it's not the main mechanism of transmission.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Belastingaangifte 2019: de belangrijkste aftrekposten en tips in \u00e9\u00e9n overzicht\n\nFoto: A worker carrying disinfection equipment at the Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport in Budapest, Hungary. Source: Zoltan Balogh/MTI via AP\n\nScientists aren't yet sure how long droplets containing the virus can live on surfaces. According to the World Health Organization, \"studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.\"\n\nThe wide range there depends on factors like the type of surface and temperature or humidity of the surrounding environment. (The length of time a virus survives on a surface also depends on what kind of droplet it's traveling in - saliva, phlegm, or aerosol.)\n\nRobert Redfield, director of the CDC, told lawmakers on Thursday that \"on copper and steel it's pretty typical, it's pretty much about two hours,\" according to Reuters.\n\n\"But I will say on other surfaces - cardboard or plastic - it's longer, and so we are looking at this,\" Redfield added.\n\nA review of 22 studies of other coronaviruses found that at room temperature, human coronaviruses could remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to nine days. But the paper also said the viruses could be rendered inactive by common disinfectants and temperatures higher than 86 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe best ways to avoid getting sick\n\nThe best ways to avoid getting the coronavirus (or any virus), according to the CDC, are to wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face. The agency also recommends disinfecting commonly touched surfaces - doorknobs, light switches, phones, and keyboards - using household cleaning spray or wipes.\n\nThe CDC suggests that anyone who might come into close contact with people who have COVID-19 take additional precautions, such as wearing a mask. While masks are not recommended for the general US public, people caring for confirmed coronavirus patients in medical settings or at home should wear them.\n\nIn addition, the CDC recommends that people exhibiting flu-like symptoms stay home. If a person with flu-like symptoms does need to go out, they should also wear a mask, the CDC says.\n\nFoto: The coronavirus imaged under a microscope.

receive medical treatment.

That could explain why its death rate is just 0.6%  --  far lower than in China or the US.", "body": "The US and South Korea announced their first cases of the coronavirus on the same day: January 20. More than six weeks later, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tested around 1,500 people for the virus. South Korea, meanwhile, has tested about 140,000.\n\nThe nation is capable of conducting as many as 10,000 tests per day and has built drive-thru testing clinics that can detect coronavirus cases in just 10 minutes. Officials say the clinics can reduce testing time by a third.\n\nThis quick response has allowed South Korea to detect more than 6,000 coronavirus patients, around 35 of whom have died. That means the country's fatality rate -- the number of deaths out of the total number of infections -- is around 0.6%.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimated on Tuesday that the global fatality rate for the coronavirus is around 3.4%. Some health experts predict that this rate will decrease as the number of cases rises. South Korea offers solid evidence for that prediction so far.\n\nWidespread testing could mean a lower death rate because the majority of coronavirus cases -- around 80% -- are considered mild. But the cases reported first are often those with the most severe symptoms, since those people go to the hospital. Milder cases, on the other hand, could go uncounted or get reported later on.\n\n\"If indeed we discover that there are far more cases that are actually being reported, and that one of the primary reasons for this is that we're just not detecting asymptomatic or mild or moderately symptomatic cases that don't end up seeking healthcare, then our estimates for the case fatality rate will likely decrease,\" Lauren Ancel Meyers, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin, told Business Insider.\n\nMild cases, she added, \"may not make it onto the radar of public health agencies.\"\n\nIn the US, people without severe symptoms haven't been tested because of limited availability, which may explain why the nation's death rate so far is high: more than 5%.\n\nThat's higher than the death rate in China -- nearly 4% -- where the outbreak started.\n\nPeople under age 40 have just a 0.2% risk of dying from the virus, early research has shown. The majority of severe cases are among elderly patients or those with preexisting health problems.\n\n\"Most people who get infected won't even know they have it,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a press briefing on Wednesday. A day later, he added: \"The facts do not merit the level of anxiety that we are seeing.\"\n\nBut until Wednesday, the CDC had only tested people who had recent exposure to a confirmed patient, had travelled to a country with an outbreak, or required hospitalization. This has made it difficult for doctors and health officials to test or diagnose many patients with mild cases, which likely explains the US' high death rate.\n\n\"There's another whole cohort that is either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic,\" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a February 6 briefing. \"We're going to see a diminution in the overall death rate.\"\n\nSouth Korea saw a spike in coronavirus cases after a 61-year-old woman transmitted the virus to other members of a fringe religious group, the controversial Shincheonji Church of Jesus. On February 23, South Korean president Moon Jae-in warned that the country faced \"a grave turning point\" in its efforts to contain the outbreak.\n\nSince then, it has implemented widespread testing.\n\nIn the US, the CDC opted to develop its own test, one that could identify multiple viruses, ProPublica reported. But the tests turned out to be faulty: A problem with one ingredient caused more than half of state labs to receive inconclusive results. In response, the CDC said it would replace the ingredient and manufacture new tests.\n\n\"What happened in the US is the CDC created and sent out a test to all 50 states and then said, 'Wait, hold up, don't use it,'\" Matthew McCarthy, a hospitalist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, told CNBC last week.\n\nBy the end of February, only three of the nation's more than 100 public-health labs had verified the CDC test for use. In the meantime, labs had to send samples to the CDC in Atlanta to confirm a case. That causes a delay of up to 48 hours between testing and confirmation.\n\n\"At first, CDC was the only place where testing could be performed,\" Richard Martinello, an associate professor of infectious disease at the Yale School of Medicine, told Business Insider. \"For a country of our size, when you only have a single site doing that, it limits the resources available for testing.\"\n\nMcCarthy told CNBC he had to call the Department of Health and \"plead to test people\" at his hospital in New York.\n\nThe US has reported around 220 cases of the virus so far, though the CDC has only confirmed 148. The confirmed cases include 46 passengers who were quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and three repatriated evacuees from Wuhan, China. But researchers at the Seattle Flu Study estimated that the number of infections in Washington state alone may have already reached 570.\n\nOn Saturday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began allowing academic hospital labs to develop and use their own coronavirus tests. The New York health department is now partnering with local hospitals to expand testing capacity for the virus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday. The goal is to conduct 1,000 test per day, he added -- but the current capacity is still limited.\n\n\"We're at a couple of hundred tests per day, so you prioritize who can be tested,\" Cuomo said.

health coverage for pre-existing conditions if Obamacare was wiped out. Here's his full answer.", "body": "Trump's answer to Fox News was erratic and offered scant detail.\n\nIn a headspinning week with President Trump making misleading claims as the nation wrestles with the outbreak of coronavirus, he also weighed in on an issue that could upend the lives of nearly 54 million Americans.\n\nAt a recent town hall organized by Fox News, anchor Martha MacCallum asked Trump how he would protect people with pre-existing conditions, which are guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act. President Obama signed it into law in March 2010 and it's his signature legislative achievement.\n\nAs the ACA enters its 10th year of existence this month, the Trump administration continues efforts to unravel and dismantle the law, popularly known as Obamacare. It backs a lawsuit, Texas vs. Aznar, led by 18 Republican states seeking to toss out Obamacare - and the case is headed back to the Supreme Court next year.\n\nThe Trump administration has tried weakening the law, such as by introducing short-term insurance plans that don't cover people with pre-existing conditions or many types of pricey hospital care.\n\nBut its protections for people with pre-existing conditions are popular with Americans across party lines. That part of the law bars insurers from hiking premiums or denying coverage to a person due to an pre-existing illness like cancer.\n\nRead more: Nobel laureate Robert Shiller identifies a rising 'existential threat' to the economy's expansion - and tells us why it's similar to what made the Great Depression so severe\n\nThe president previously vowed Republicans would be known as \"the party of healthcare,\" but the GOP has struggled crafting an alternative to the law it sought to wipe out. Though Trump has repeatedly claimed any legislation replacing Obamacare would carry similar protections for patients, there is scant detail on what shape it would take.\n\nAt the town hall, Trump said Republicans have done a \"great\" job in \"managing\" the ACA.\n\nMacCallum then asked: \"Because the issue of pre-existing conditions, you say you're going to protect them. But your administration is also fighting Obamacare in the courts. So how do you promise you're going to protect them based on that?\"\n\nHere's what the president said, per a White House transcript.\n\nTRUMP: \"That's what I said. We want to terminate Obamacare because it's bad. Look, we're running it really well, but we know it's defective. It's very defective. We got rid of the worst part. And that was a very important thing. You know getting rid of the individual mandate was a very important thing.\n\nBut we want to get something - if we can get the House, you'll have the best healthcare and health insurance anywhere on the planet. But we have to get the House back.\n\nNow, that means we have to hold the Senate. We have to get the House. We have to, obviously, keep the White House. But, what we're doing is managing it really well.\n\nNow, it's a case; it's called Texas vs. - you understand - it's Texas who is suing. They want to terminate it. But everybody there is also saying, and everybody - we have our great senator from Pennsylvania. Thank you very much, Pat, for being here. (Applause.) And Pat Toomey.\n\nAnd - but, very important - and our - by the way, our great congressmen, I have to say, they were warriors. Right? Real warriors, in terms of the fake impeachment. I will tell you that. (Applause.)\n\nBut, so Texas is trying - and it's Texas and many states - they're trying to terminate, but they want to put something that's much better. They're terminating it to put much better. And they've all pledged that preexisting conditions, 100 percent taken care of.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_zeballos_roig@businessinsider.com", "name": "Joseph Zeballos-Roig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-existing_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pre-existing condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_MacCallum", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Martha MacCallum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Shiller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert J.

Here's how to protect yourself.", "body": "To lower your risk of catching the new coronavirus, health authorities recommend staying 6 feet from individuals who show any signs of illness. That's because the coronavirus typically spreads via airborne particles when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Those viral particles can then infect someone after they land on their nose or mouth or get inhaled.\n\nBut a growing body of research suggests the coronavirus can also spread via poop particles.\n\nA study of three coronavirus patients in Singapore, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, revealed that the virus showed up in their stool. Samples taken from the toilet bowls and sinks in the patients' isolation rooms came back positive for the virus.\n\nThat evidence supports findings from researchers at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who also detected viable virus particles in coronavirus patients' feces.\n\nChina's National Health Commission has confirmed that the virus can spread through contaminated poop, the South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe fact that the virus can be passed through both our respiratory and digestive systems may explain how it spread from its origin city of Wuhan, China to more than 80 countries in just a few months, researchers suggest.\n\nThe authors of the Chinese CDC study wrote that \"stool samples may contaminate hands, food, water, etc.,\" then cause infection if the particles enter a person's mouth, nose, or eyes. For example, an infected patient could use the bathroom, forget to wash their hands or give only a cursory rinse, then touch a friend's hand. That friend could then rub their face and get virus. In medicine, this is known as fecal-oral transmission.\n\n\"This virus has many routes of transmission, which can partially explain its strong transmission and fast transmission speed,\" the study authors wrote.\n\nThat research and the new case study from Singapore adds to a growing body of evidence we have about fecal-oral transmission risk. Here are three other pieces of evidence:\n\nOther coronaviruses - like those that infect horses and cats - frequently spread via poop. If a healthy horse eats a piece of hay contaminated with fecal matter from an infected horse, for example, it can get sick. Researchers think the new coronavirus jumped from bats to another animal before infecting humans. That initial spread from bats likely happened via poop, too.\n\nThe Chinese CDC said the possibility of fecal-oral transmission further underscores the importance of frequent hand washing and the need to disinfect objects and surfaces in medical facilities, transportation vehicles, public toilets, and homes.\n\nOther viruses like Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E also spread via fecal-oral transmission. Such viruses can use \"a vehicle such as food, water, or utensil, and enter a new host through the mouth,\" according to the US CDC.\n\nAccordingly, careful food-handling and washing is also important. Both the US and Chinese CDCs recommend boiling drinking water if there's a possibility it could be contaminated with sewage, and not eating raw food like shellfish or produce that may have been harvested or washed in contaminated water.\n\nAvoiding swimming pools that may contain contaminated water is also important.\n\nDuring the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak (SARS is also a coronavirus), researchers documented an instance in which one sick person had diarrhea in a Hong Kong apartment building, and the virus then traveled through the pipes to infect other residents.\n\nIn that instance, an issue with the drainage pipes caused a situation in which running exhaust fans with the bathroom door closed created enough negative pressure to suck fecal droplets out of the sewage system and into the bathroom. Those virus-laden droplets then landed on floor mats, towels, and toiletries that residents touched.\n\nUp to 76% of SARS patients experienced diarrhea. The symptom has also cropped up among a minority of patients with the new coronavirus: The first US patient had diarrhea the day after he arrived at the hospital. Coronavirus patients in Vietnam have also reported diarrhea as a symptom, and a non-peer-reviewed study of 1,099 Chinese patients found that 4% had diarrhea, too.\n\nBut a person with the new coronavirus doesn't need to have an upset stomach to shed the virus in their poop. One of the patients from the Singapore case study had normal stool, but their poop still tested positive.\n\nMorgan McFall-Johnsen contributed reporting to this story.\n\nRead more about the new coronavirus:\n\nSome coronavirus patients experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea before they get a fever. They could spread the virus through poop.\n\nWorkers at 6 US hospitals reveal how they respond to potential coronavirus cases - including face shields and negative-pressure isolation chambers\n\nPeople are racing to buy face masks amid the coronavirus outbreak, but they probably won't protect you from illness", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

many of these products are quickly selling out or appearing at prices well above market retail. We're doing our best to keep this guide updated with in-stock purchase links.\n\nWhen I, as a teenager, bought my first car, my parents gave me a roadside emergency kit for Christmas. For years, that kit sat in the back of my car, unused - until one day it didn't. When my car broke down on the side of the road, during torrential rain, I was so glad to have that kit. It had everything I needed, including a poncho, reflective triangle, and roadside flares. It also contained jumper cables that I've now used numerous times to help friends jump-start their cars' dead batteries.\n\nDon't think of roadside emergency kits as \"just in case\" purchases; if you are ever in a situation where you'd need them, they're invaluable. You can purchase everything from the most basic kit to a deluxe package with more supplies than you could ever possibly use, but finding the right kit takes some time. Some more affordable kits include low-quality supplies, and when you're in a pinch you don't want to depend on a product that won't work. Other kits have some essential items, but they don't include some important basics you'll almost certainly need.\n\nWe've identified the best roadside emergency kits to help make your decision easier. Our selections are based on a number of factors, and we've assessed the items contained in the kits, any valuable items that may be missing, the overall quality of the products, the kits' price points, and how satisfied buyers are with their purchases. Many of these kits include items that the National Safety Council, Ready, and the American Automobile Association recommend in a roadside emergency kit, but not all, like a can opener, batteries, hand-crank radio, etc.\n\nKeeping a kit in each vehicle you drive can give you peace of mind that you're prepared in the case of a breakdown or an accident. These kits also make excellent gifts for new drivers, or for anyone who has a vehicle but doesn't yet have a kit of their own.\n\nUpdated on 3/2/20 by Amir Ismael. Updated prices, links, and formatting. Updated disclaimer regarding the new coronavirus. Added a slide with other vehicle and roadside safety stories.\n\nIf you'd like to be super-prepared for just about any situation you could encounter while on the road, then the Roadside Emergency Assistance Kit is for you. This comprehensive 110-piece kit contains practical supplies that you're likely to put to use, like a heavy-duty tow strap, a flashlight, a tire pressure gauge, and jumper cables. It also includes a few items you're less likely to need - a seat belt cutter, an emergency blanket, a windshield breaker - but that are definitely worth having, if only for the peace of mind.\n\nThe 64-piece first aid kit tucked inside the larger canvas duffel bag is also super comprehensive, with items like arm slings, an assortment of bandages, medical tape, gauze, and alcohol pads.\n\nOther key resources you'll find: a magnesium fire starter, a roadside warning sign, and an 11-in-one multi-tool.\n\nWe did come across a few buyer reviews mentioning that the jumper cables didn't feel as sturdy as they had hoped.\n\nPros: 110 pieces to handle nearly any emergency, 64-piece first aid kit, items to get you back on the road\n\nA breakdown in winter weather requires particular supplies, and the Lifeline AAA Severe Weather Road Safety Kit is designed just for that circumstance. Warmth will become a real concern in the event that you can't turn your vehicle on or have limited gas, and this kit includes warmth accessories such as tea candles; a fleece set of gloves, scarf, and hat; an emergency blanket; and hand-warmer packets.\n\nAdditional supplies include a folding shovel, LED flashlight, batteries, emergency whistle, and ice scraper. This kit also includes a 45-piece first aid kit. Everything is stored neatly in a compact bag that can fit underneath a seat.\n\nThe value of this kit is really in its warming items, which aren't offered by many other kits. If you live in an area that receives harsh winter weather, this kit would be well worth the investment. Pair this kit with some visibility essentials, like road flares, and you'll have a well-rounded emergency supply collection for winter weather.\n\nPros: Warming supplies, 45-piece first aid kit\n\nCons: Battery-powered flashlight would be better if replaced by a light with a hand crank, kit would benefit from some emergency visibility supplies\n\nWhereas many emergency kits fall short on quality high-visibility products, the Always Prepared Reflective Car Emergency Roadside Kit focuses entirely on making you visible to other drivers. These items are essential for keeping you safe if your car breaks down on the side of the road, and increased visibility can potentially keep other drivers from hitting you or your car.\n\nThis kit contains everything you need to maximize your safety during a breakdown. Two reflective triangles fold up for compact storage and can be set out to draw attention to your vehicle. One flashing LED emergency light and one neon safety vest also help to keep you safe and visible.\n\nAll of these items fit neatly inside a storage bag that can be tucked underneath a seat or placed in your trunk. Because it doesn't contain other essential items, it's best paired with another roadside emergency kit.\n\nPros: Higher quality, heavy-duty visibility items, easy to use, compact storage fits under a seat\n\nCons: Should be paired with another kit for a more complete supply of emergency items\n\nWant to keep your steering wheel cool in the summer, warm in the winter, and stylish all year round?

About 80% of cases and deaths are in China. But the death rate - the number of known deaths out of the total number of confirmed cases - varies widely by country right now. Generally, the death rate seems to decrease as more people are tested and cases are confirmed. The following chart shows the death rates in countries with confirmed deaths and more than 100 cases. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe death rate from the new coronavirus is higher in the US so far than anywhere else in the world. The rate, a basic calculation that divides the number of known deaths by the total number of confirmed cases, was about 6% in the US as of Friday morning. Fourteen Americans have died out of less than 250 confirmed cases.\n\nSouth Korea, which has the second highest number of cases outside of China, has a death rate that's one-tenth of that. Out of 6,593 cases, 42 people have died: o.6%.\n\nWhile this variation between countries may sound concerning, the rate strongly depends on how many people get tested for the virus. In countries like South Korea and China, which have tested hundreds of thousands of people, the death rate is lower than, say, the US, which has tested less than 2,000.\n\nFoto: Source: Shayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nGiven that the COVID-19 outbreak is still growing and evolving, and countries' case totals and death tolls are constantly changing, countries' death rates are not static and will continue to fluctuate.\n\nMany health experts predict that death rates overall will decrease as the number of cases rises and the amount of testing increases. South Korea, which has tested more than 140,000 people offers solid evidence for that prediction so far.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Dit doet het coronavirus met je portemonnee: hypotheek goedkoper, benzine goedkoper, gas goedkoper... maar je pensioen is in gevaar Why more testing could decrease the death rate\n\nWidespread testing could mean a lower death rate because the majority of coronavirus cases - around 80% - are considered mild. But the cases tested and reported first are often those with the most severe symptoms, since those people go to the hospital. Milder cases, on the other hand, could go uncounted or get reported later on.\n\n\"If indeed we discover that there are far more cases that are actually being reported, and that one of the primary reasons for this is that we're just not detecting asymptomatic or mild or moderately symptomatic cases that don't end up seeking healthcare, then our estimates for the case fatality rate will likely decrease,\" Lauren Ancel Meyers, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin, previously told Business Insider.\n\nMild cases, she added, \"may not make it onto the radar of public health agencies.\"\n\nIndeed, in the US so far, many people without severe symptoms haven't been tested because of limited testing availability.\n\nThe death rate is not the same as your chance of dying\n\nFoto: Medical members wearing protective gear guide drivers at a \"drive-through\" virus test facility in Goyang, north of Seoul, on February 29, 2020. Source: Getty Images\n\nThe World Health Organization estimated on Tuesday that the global death rate for the coronavirus is around 3.4%.\n\nThe death rate of a disease is different from its mortality rate - the latter is the number of deaths out of the number of people in an at-risk population. A death rate is not a reflection of the likelihood that any given person will die if infected.\n\nAccording to Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, the best estimates of the overall mortality rate for COVID-19 in the US are between 0.1% and 1%.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe coronavirus has pandemic 'potential' as it spreads in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, according to WHO\n\nOne key indicator will tell us when the coronavirus outbreak is winding down -
