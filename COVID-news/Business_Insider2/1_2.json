Bill Gates says we should prepare for a deadly outbreak as we do for war.", "body": "It's a reminder that the world is not prepared to fight a major pandemic. Bill Gates says a deadly pandemic is one of the world's three biggest threats.\n\nIt started with a few cases of what seemed like pneumonia.\n\nChinese authorities reported on December 31 that 41 people in Wuhan, the most populous city in central China, were afflicted with a pneumonia-like illness. The likely source of the outbreak was the local Huanan seafood market, which sells live animals. The market closed a day after the outbreak was reported.\n\nBy January 7, Chinese authorities had determined that the illness was a new type of coronavirus: a large family of viruses that typically affect the respiratory tract.\n\nThe first death was reported a few days later; local officials announced the second on Thursday.\n\nThe virus has now spread to Thailand and Japan. A 61-year-old female tourist in Thailand was diagnosed on Tuesday. She'd recently spent time in Wuhan but said she did not visited the now-shuttered seafood market. The woman did visit another local market with live animals, though.\n\nJapan's health ministry reported Wednesday that a man in his 30s has the virus as well. That patient recently came back from a trip to China, where he did not visit any seafood markets, according to the ministry.\n\n\"It is possible that the patient had close contact with an unknown patient with lung inflammation while in China,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said there's no clear evidence that the virus can be transmitted between humans -- most likely it just passes from animals to people. But the two cases outside of China have called that into question.\n\nIf the virus were to somehow morph into a pandemic (a far cry from the situation right now), the world wouldn't be remotely prepared, according to Bill Gates.\n\n\"In the case of biological threats, that sense of urgency is lacking,\" Gates said in a 2018 presentation hosted by the New England Journal of Medicine. \"The world needs to prepare for pandemics in the same serious way it prepares for war.\"\n\nSome of the patients who contracted the new virus reported symptoms such fever, chills, headaches, and sore throat. A few had difficulty breathing.\n\nCoronaviruses can lead to illnesses like the common cold, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a potentially fatal illness that hasn't been reported anywhere since 2004.\n\nA viral outbreak of SARS that started in China in November 2002 resulted in 8,000 cases and 774 deaths by July 2003. The outbreak spread to dozens of countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Recent research suggests that it may have spread to humans from horseshoe bats.\n\nThough Chinese officials don't expect the new coronavirus to spread from human to human, they have quarantined patients and closely observed anyone who has been in close contact with them.\n\nAirports in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and South Korea are also closely screening passengers for fever. Hundreds of millions of people are expected to travel throughout China later this month for the Lunar New Year.\n\nGates considers a deadly pandemic to be one of the world's three biggest threats, next to climate change and nuclear war.\n\nHe has repeatedly warned about what might happen if the world were struck by a pandemic virus like the Spanish flu of 1918, which killed 50 million people. A similar scenario today might kill more than 30 million people in less than a year, Gates said in his presentation.\n\nThe statistic comes from the Institute for Disease Modeling, which predicts that the world will experience such an outbreak in the next 10 to 15 years. One possible source of the virus could be animals such as birds, chicken, or pigs.\n\n\"More than 60% of human disease, particularly related to infections, are coming from animals,\" Victor Dzau, the president of the National Academy of Medicine, told Insider. \"The fact that animals are not living in the forest but we are domesticating them ... putting them in crowded conditions close to humans, that's really a very big factor.\"\n\nAnimal-borne diseases can morph to jump to humans and spread between people, especially among travelers or in dense urban areas. Rising global temperatures also heighten the risk of mosquito-borne diseases.\n\nThough the world is armed with antiviral drugs and antibiotics, Gates has said, new vaccines would likely be necessary to address and prevent future epidemics. That's because strange pathogens emerge all the time, finding new ways to mutate or jump from their host to other species.\n\nIn a 2017 op-ed for Business Insider, Gates wrote that the process of creating a vaccine takes too long -- about 10 years for development and licensing. He estimated that = process would need to be reduced to 90 days or less to prevent deaths from an airborne pathogen.\n\nGates also said countries should routinely monitor their populations for signs of an outbreak. Once a new virus strikes, the countries could then share that information with the rest of the world, in addition to coordinating with military and medical professionals to control the spread of the virus.\n\n\"The irony is that the cost of ensuring adequate pandemic preparedness worldwide is estimated at $3.4 billion a year -- yet the projected annual loss from a pandemic could run as high as $570 billion,\" Gates wrote. \"Even if the next pandemic isn't on the scale of the 1918 flu, we would be wise to consider the social and economic turmoil.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com",

official totals, scientists warn", "body": "Using statistical modelling, the academics from Imperial College London suggested the true number of infected people is somewhere around 1,723 as of January 12.\n\nScientists have warned that official totals from Chinese authorities of how many people have been infected with a deadly and little-understood new virus could be out by a factor of 35.\n\nAccording to public health officials in Wuhan, central China, 45 people have been infected with 2019-nCov, the scientific name for a new, viral strain of pneumonia. Two of the patients have died.\n\nHowever, according to an analysis from Imperial College London, the number of people to be infected as of January 12 (per the study) is likely more in the region of 1,723 -- a figure around 35 times greater than the 45 cases confirmed in a lab.\n\nTheir analysis relies on statistical projection to figure out how widely the virus has spread from its point of origin at a seafood market in Wuhan.\n\nIt hinges on the fact that three cases have been detected abroad: two in Thailand and one in Japan.\n\nGiven that only around 3,400 of Wuhan's 19 million residents take international flights each day, the experts said that in order for three infected people to have made it abroad, the total number must be in the thousands.\n\nThe scientists admit that their method is imprecise. As well as the 1,723 figure from their preferred scenario, the team of five academics gave other possible figures. The lowest was 996 and the highest 2,298.\n\nHere is the academics' conclusion:\n\n\"It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported.\n\n\"The estimates presented here suggest surveillance should be expanded to include all hospitalised cases of pneumonia or severe respiratory disease in the Wuhan area and other well-connected Chinese cities.\"\n\nIn the US, three airports that receive passengers from Wuhan have begun screening passengers for the disease, in the hope that they can stop it from infecting Americans.\n\nThe airports are San Francisco International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and New York's John F.

Prevent the spread of flu, colds, and measles by using disinfecting products like Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, Lysol Laundry Sanitizer, and Purell Disinfectant Spray.\n\nYoung children love to bring things home from school or daycare to share. Unfortunately what they seem to bring home most often is every seasonal infectious disease. The cause may be a virus, bacteria, fungus, or parasite.\n\nBut no matter the culprit, the results are not good for anyone. So what can we do to help our families stay healthier?\n\nPreventative measures like healthy eating, exercise, and plenty of sleep are essential, of course. Another important step in preventing the spread of infections is proper cleaning and sanitizing.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the most important surface to clean to avoid the spread of colds, flu, measles, and other diseases is our hands. Elaine Donoghue, MD, FAAP adds, \"In addition to washing hands, circulating fresh air, and cleaning and sanitizing surfaces that have been in contact with body fluids will reduce the spread of infectious diseases.\"\n\nWe have tested and gathered the best products and tips to help you sanitize most of the surfaces your kids use in your home and slow the spread of many communicable diseases. Each product is great for busy parents because they are simple to use and selected for safety to sanitize each area of your home.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Je geld van de bank halen bij 0 of een negatieve spaarrente?

These devices hold onto every bacteria they encounter, and the warmth from their batteries allows that bacteria to grow and thrive. HomeSoap UV Electronics Sanitizer safely kills bacteria like Escherichia coli (E. Coli), Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella), and Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) in just 10 minutes using UV-C light.\n\nI was first introduced to this product when I tried PhoneSoapGo that sanitizes and charges a cell phone while traveling. But most kids have larger devices, and that's why I gave the HomeSoap unit a try. With interior dimensions of 13.18 inches long by 3.43 inches wide and 9.13 inches high, this device can accommodate almost every type of handheld electronics. And with two USB ports for charging, the electronics come out freshly sanitized and charged.\n\nJust place the item you want to clean inside (you can even sanitize toothbrushes, pacifiers, and bottles) and make sure the unit is plugged in. You'll see several \"light bulbs\" lining the interior walls. They provide the UV-C germicidal short wavelength, ultraviolet light that breaks apart the DNA of bacteria and germs leaving it unable to harm or reproduce. Close the device and a blue indicator will come on, and when it goes off after around 10 minutes, your item is 99.99% germ-free. The use of UV-C light is used in hospital surgical suites to aid in killing superbugs.\n\nI use my HomeSoap religiously for all types of devices, and you should too.\n\nHow to use Lysol Laundry Sanitizer to clean all of your washable fabrics\n\nFoto: sourceAmazon\n\nRaise your hand if you've ever seen a child wipe his nose and mouth on his sleeve. Okay, you don't have to raise your hand, but I know you've seen it, and if it's your child, you need Lysol Laundry Sanitizer.\n\nBacteria and germs can live on fabric surfaces for days, and regular washing, especially in cold water, won't take care of every problem. There are several ways you can sanitize washable fabrics. Chlorine bleach and pine oil kill germs but can harm some fabrics, and quaternary formulas used in hospitals are difficult to find. But Lysol's phenolic disinfectant is readily available and safe for all washable fabrics.\n\nBleach-free and safe to use in standard and high-efficiency washers, Lysol Laundry Sanitizer is easy to use. Just add the recommended amount of liquid to the washer's fabric softener dispenser so the sanitizer will be dispersed through the rinse water. If you don't have a dispenser, wait until the rinse cycle to add the product directly to the washer drum. The product comes in a Crisp Linen scent and is also available in an unscented dye-free formula.\n\nIn addition to the health benefits, the sanitizer also kills odor-causing bacteria that can leave clothes like socks and underwear smelling less than fresh. As a mother and grandmother, I recommend using this product regularly when washing your children's laundry, including clothes, coats and accessories, towels, bedding, and for the entire family's laundry if a virus is running rampant through the house. Everyone will be glad you did.\n\nHow to use Clorox Disinfecting Wipes to sanitize bathrooms, backpacks, plastic toys, and most hard surfaces\n\nFoto: sourceAmazon\n\nDisposable cleaning wipes have changed the way we clean thanks to the simplicity of grabbing a damp cloth to clean up a mess and then tossing it away. But not every wipe is created equal, so to prevent the spread of illness, you need one that not just cleans messes but can disinfect surfaces killing germs and bacteria, like Clorox Disinfecting Wipes.\n\nHaving toured the research facilities of The Clorox Company, I can tell you that they know about germs. Gleaming white labs are filled with toxins from around the world, and in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Clorox is dedicated to controlling the spread of diseases to keep us healthy. Out of that research came Clorox Disinfecting Wipes as a simple way to tackle germs on most hard surfaces in our homes.\n\nThe key to killing bacteria and preventing the spread of disease is how you use the wipes. One wipe will not disinfect an entire room or dozens of toys. There must be sufficient disinfectant left on every surface to be effective. Make sure you're not just spreading germs around.\n\nTo kill bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica, use enough wipes to leave a nonporous surface visibly wet for four minutes before the surface is allowed to air dry. Luckily, the most common viruses like Influenza A2 and Human Coronavirus can be eradicated by leaving the surface wet for only 15 to 30 seconds before allowing to dry. If used correctly, the wipes kill 99.9% of the viruses and bacteria on hard surfaces.\n\nClorox Disinfecting Wipes are safe to use on granite, acrylic, plastics, vinyl, and even sealed hardwood surfaces. The one downside is that any area used for food preparation or a toy that might end up in a child's mouth must be rinsed with plain water once the disinfectant dries.\n\nI use them for bathroom fixtures and counters, light switches, cabinet handles, doorknobs, and all the surfaces our hands touch dozens of times each day. One of the most effective uses is for cleaning backpacks daily. Think of all of the germs inside and outside that backpack. Have your child empty the backpack (also a good time for tossing out items) and wipe it down well inside and out with a Clorox wipe. Don't forget the zipper pulls and handles. Allow the surfaces to dry and you've added one more layer of protection.\n\nHow to Use Purell Disinfectant Spray to clean food preparation areas and baby toys\n\nFoto: sourceAmazon\n\nThere are lots of great products on the market that disinfect surfaces, but they are not safe for baby's toys that often end up in the mouth or in food preparation areas without an added step of a rinse after disinfecting. That's why you need Purell Disinfectant Spray.\n\nWhen I want to clean a toy for my 2-year-old grandson, he is not happy to wait while the disinfectant wipe does its work, dries, and I rinse the toy with fresh water and dry it before he can play with it again. With Purell, I can give it a spritz, wait 30 seconds (three stanzas of \"The Wheels on the Bus\"), and he is ready to play.\n\nWith a rapid kill time of only 30 seconds, the product is also quick drying. And with the designation of a Safer Choice Product by the EPA, surfaces are safe to touch nearly instantly. Simply spray on a kitchen counter, cutting board, baby's crib railing or pet's chew toy, and it can be used safely without rinsing.\n\nWhile Purell doesn't portend to deep clean surfaces, the one-step disinfectant will kill cold and flu viruses, Norovirus, Strep, and MRSA on plastics, metal, granite, sealed wood, and upholstery to kill germs with patented ethyl alcohol technology. It does not leave surfaces feeling sticky to attract even more grime.\n\nFirst introduced to the mass market in 2016, the product is offered in a citrus scent in 32-ounce spray bottles and in a 1-gallon jug that can be used to refill spray containers. If you would prefer an unscented version, try Purell Professional Foodservice Surface Sanitizer.\n\nHow to use Lysol Disinfectant Spray to sanitize nonwashable surfaces\n\nFoto: sourceAmazon\n\nWhen one of your kids has a cold or the flu, do they stay in bed or wander out to the couch and use the TV remotes and head to the kitchen to grab a snack from the refrigerator? When they cough into the throw pillow or touch the handle on the fridge, they leave behind bacteria for everyone else.\n\nThat's why you need a good disinfecting spray like Lysol. This is not just an air-freshener; it contains the ingredients necessary to kill bacteria and is safe to use on fabrics and hard surfaces. I like to use it on bed linens between changes to freshen the fabric and kill lingering bacteria.\n\nThe key to proper protection is to cover the surface with the mist and allow it to remain wet for 30 seconds to 10 minutes. The active ingredients in the spray need time to work. Drying times for specific viruses are listed on the container. Remember, if you are spraying surfaces that might end up in a mouth, they must be rinsed with clean water after the Lysol spray has dried.\n\nWith a dozen scents, you're sure to find one that suits your sensibilities to use as both an air freshener and surface disinfectant. I often give surfaces, especially upholstery, a quick spray just before leaving the house so I come home to a fresher, less germy home.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_marlowe_leverette@businessinsider.com", "name": "Mary Marlowe Leverette", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Purell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lysol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clorox", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clorox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Academy of Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultraviolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disinfectant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laundry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laundry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Measles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_(pharmacy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet (pharmacy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microorganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Salmonella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washing machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Cleaning", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Cleaning", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5e1ca862b2e66a661c5f077f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 37}, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 37, "relevance": 27}], "totalResults": 4, "page": 1, "count": 4, "pages": 1}}
