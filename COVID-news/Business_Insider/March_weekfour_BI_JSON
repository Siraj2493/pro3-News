As of last week, 13 postal workers had been sickened. By Tuesday morning, more than 46,000 cases had been identified in the US. Any interruption in mail service could delay critical medicine deliveries and upend postal voting in the upcoming election. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nRegular mail service could be shut down as early as June, two US representatives are warning, and the effects could be disastrous.\n\nCritical supplies, like the post office's billion shipments of prescription drugs last year, could be stuck, mail voting in the upcoming November election could be stymied, and hundreds of thousands of postal employees could be out of work.\n\n\"Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,\" representatives Carolyn Maloney and Gerry Connolly, said in a statement Monday.\n\n\"Every community in America relies on the Postal Service to deliver vital goods and services, including life-saving medications. The Postal Service needs America's help, and we must answer this call.\"\n\nThe duo also introduced a bill that would provide $25 billion in emergency funding for the Postal Service, while eliminating the agency's debt and requiring it to prioritize medical deliveries.\n\nThe bill would also create temporary delivery points in order to protect workers. It's not clear what these might look like, as the design is left up to the Postal Service, but the language implies something similar to Amazon's delivery lockers that allow people to order deliveries to a secure location other than their home.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Coronavirus-update: Verenigde Staten telt na Itali\u00eb meeste actieve gevallen - sterftecijfers verschillen sterk per land\n\nPost Offices, like hospitals, grocery stores, and other essential businesses, have remained open despite the shuttering of many others as the coronavirus continues to spread. As of Tuesday morning, more than 46,000 cases had been identified in the country, some of those have included postal workers.\n\nSome 13 postal workers had fallen sick by last Thursday, the New York Times reported. The head of the Postal Mail Handlers Union told the paper that workers have fallen sick in Miami, New York City, Seattle, Portland, and others. It's a small number of the agency's roughly 630,000 employees but underscores the effects the virus has had on a number of industries.\n\n\"These negative effects could be even more dire in rural areas, where millions of Americans are sheltering in place and rely on the Postal Service to deliver essential staples,\" the representatives' statement said.", "source": {"uri":

of fever and coughing, they believe.\n\nAnyone experiencing a sudden loss of smell could be a \"hidden carrier\" of the coronavirus, even if they have no other symptoms, according to evidence compiled by leading rhinologists in the UK.\n\nIn South Korea, China, and Italy, about a third of patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 have also reported a loss of smell -- known as anosmia or hyposmia -- leading ear, nose, and throat experts in the UK have reported.\n\n\"In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases,\" the president of the British Rhinological Society Professor, Clare Hopkins, and the president of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, professor Nirmal Kumar, said in a joint statement.\n\nThe professors said that many patients around the world who have tested positive for COVID-19 are presenting only the symptoms of loss of smell and taste -- without the more commonly recognised symptoms of high fever and coughing.\n\n\"There have been a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms,\" the statement says. \"Iran has reported a sudden increase in cases of isolated anosmia, and many colleagues from the US, France, and Northern Italy have the same experience.\"\n\nThe lack of other recognised symptoms in these cases may mean they are unlikely to be tested and isolated, meaning they could be contributing to the rapid spread of the disease worldwide.\n\n\"These patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19,\" they added.\n\nProfessor Kumar told Sky News that younger patients in particular may demonstrate only a loss of smell or taste, without demonstrating the more commonly recognised coronavirus symptoms of high fever and persistent coughs.\n\n\"In young patients, they do not have any significant symptoms such as the cough and fever, but they may have just the loss of sense of smell and taste, which suggests that these viruses are lodging in the nose,\" he said.\n\nThe professors called for anyone presenting the symptoms of loss of taste or smell to self-isolate for seven days to prevent the further spread of the disease.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com",

world's health at risk", "body": "The US this week became the country with the most cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's refusal to implement mass testing for the coronavirus in the United States will have \"global repercussions,\" a South Korean doctor said.\n\nIn an interview with Wired this week, Min Pok-kee, whose aggressive approach to tackling the COVID-19 virus in the city of Daegu became a model for South Korea's nationwide response, said Trump's failure meant that \"it's inevitable that you become like Italy.\"\n\n\"The United States is very late to this,\" he said. \"And the president and the officials working on it seem to think they aren't late. This has both national and global repercussions.\n\n\"It isn't enough for Korea alone to survive. In the US, Trump is talking about taking care of his own, but the entire world has to respond in sync.\"\n\nHe said the president's failure to provide widespread testing was because of his \"pride\" and \"ego.\"\n\n\"Trump has spoken dismissively about testing because of his ego,\" Min said. \"As we scientists see it, he's motivated by pride. The doctors in the US all know that this sort of testing is appropriate.\"\n\nThe US this week became the country with the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, with over 85,000 as of Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea's coronavirus strategy has been lauded as a model for other countries. Since the virus hit the country in mid-February, its government has focused on testing lots of people, even introducing drive-thru testing stations.\n\nSouth Korea's focus on mass testing has helped it \"flatten the curve\" and take control of the spread of the virus. As of Friday morning, it had 9,332 confirmed coronavirus cases and 139 deaths.\n\nMin, whose daughter attends college in the US, said social distancing should be \"instituted comprehensively\" in the US to avoid the national crisis seen in Italy.\n\n\"How are existing facilities in the US going to handle all the infected patients? They can't,\" he told Wired.\n\n\"So then it's inevitable that you become like Italy. Korea also could have become like Italy, but we assessed the situation very quickly. What should the United States do? For now, social distancing must be instituted comprehensively, and field hospitals must be built.\"\n\nMin also criticized the UK's initial response to the virus, saying that people in South Korea were baffled when the UK government pursued a strategy of achieving \"herd immunity.\"\n\nThis strategy, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson abandoned last week, was based on the belief that it would be harder for the coronavirus to spread in the future once it has affected a majority of the British population.\n\nScientists warned Johnson's government that this risked killing thousands of people. Johnson has since switched to a strategy of strict social distancing, with an ambition to significantly ramp up testing.\n\nMin said that \"the UK offers a cautionary tale.\"\n\n\"Its first response was to say that people would develop herd immunity, though it switched course a few days later. I'd already been concerned about the capacity of the British system, and this made me very worried.\n\n\"Herd immunity only works if you have a vaccine and 85 to 90 percent of the population is inoculated.\n\n\"Right now, in the face of an infectious disease with such a high mortality rate, for the UK to resist acknowledging the reality of the virus could translate into tens of thousands of deaths. It was unthinkable for a government to put out such nonsense.\n\n\"We in Korea were thinking, 'Are these people in their right mind?'\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_payne@businessinsider.com", "name": "Adam Payne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daegu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daegu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Daegu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herd immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boris Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inoculation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e7ddf2d2d654f0a935660a3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 61374, "pinterest": 9}, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 61383, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6004990415", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-23", "time": "20:36:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-23T20:36:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-23T20:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9725490212440491, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-public-ordered-stay-at-home-covid-19-2020-3", "title": "The UK has gone into full coronavirus lockdown with the public banned from leaving home for nonessential reasons", "body": "The UK goes into full lockdown with the British public ordered to stay at home.

And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives.\"\n\nThe announcement came after multiple reports that the prime minister had been under intense pressure from within his own government to bring forward a full UK lockdown amid surging numbers of cases across the country.\n\nOne senior government source told The Times of London on Monday that a lockdown was \"inevitable.\"\n\n\"The prime minister will have the full support of the Cabinet and the country at large if he goes ahead with this,\" the source said.\n\n\"It is inevitable - you just have to look at other countries.

Don't believe anything that the president says and his people ... call your doctor.\"\n\nThe wife of an Arizona man who died after ingesting chloroquine phosphate to protect himself from the coronavirus spoke out on Monday to warn the public not to \"take anything\" or \"believe anything\" without speaking to a healthcare professional.\n\n\"We saw Trump on TV -- every channel -- and all of his buddies and that this was safe,\" the woman told NBC News' Vaughn Hillyard, referring to President Donald Trump. \"Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure.\"\n\nNBC News reported that the man, 68, and his wife, 61, both took chloroquine to guard against the novel coronavirus, which causes a potentially fatal disease known as COVID-19. It's not clear how much chloroquine the man ingested, and Banner Health said he and his wife ingested a version of the chemical that's used to clean aquariums.\n\nBoth individuals needed to seek medical care within half an hour; the woman is currently in critical condition and the man eventually died.\n\nChloroquine is used to treat malaria, but there is no conclusive evidence that it is effective against the coronavirus, which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic earlier this month.\n\nHowever, the president repeatedly touted the drug as a \"very powerful\" treatment for the disease and falsely claimed it had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\"It's shown very encouraging -- very, very encouraging early results,\" Trump said last week. \"And we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately. And that's where the FDA has been so great. They -- they've gone through the approval process; it's been approved. And they did it, they took it down from many, many months to immediate. So we're going to be able to make that drug available by prescription or states.\"\n\nThe FDA came out with a statement after Trump's comments saying it had not approved chloroquine for the coronavirus and that much more research had to be done.\n\n\"Did you at any point hear that the FDA had not approved of it for coronavirus purposes?\" Hillyard asked the woman.\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"But, you know, they kept saying that it was approved for other things.\"\n\nAsked what her message to the American public is after what she and her husband went through, the woman told NBC News, \"Oh my God, don't take anything. Don't believe anything that the president says and his people ... call your doctor.\"\n\n\"Please educate the people,\" she added, according to audio of the conversation that Hillyard posted to Twitter. \"It feels like, like my heart is broken and it'll never mend. It's just broke, dead. Like my husband. My husband is 68. We're healthy. No underlying -- no diabetes or lung issues.

Although Italy has more than 69,000 confirmed cases -- the second-highest number of coronavirus infections -- only 9,300 have recovered from COVID-19 so far, and more than 7,500 Italians have died after contracting the virus.\n\nBased on numbers from Microsoft, here's how other countries compare, as of Wednesday evening:\n\nWhat \"recovered\" means differs by person, and is something researchers will be figuring out for years to come. Some patients who had mild symptoms have reported feeling fine after the disease passed, while others with more severe cases might have lasting lung damage. It could depend on a person's age and if they had any preexisting conditions before they got the coronavirus.\n\nIn the early days of the outbreak, China made up a majority of the global cases -- but the virus rapidly spread across the globe and it wasn't long before global infections surpassed those in China. Most recently, Spain recorded more than 730 new coronavirus deaths in one day, meaning it has now surpassed the death toll in China. Italy's death toll has passed China's, too.\n\nChina quickly implemented strict quarantine measures in January, including city-wide lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing campaigns. The number of Chinese patients who have recovered from the coronavirus surpassed the number still being treated on March 6, suggesting the country was overcoming the epidemic.\n\nWhile \"community spread\" (meaning transmission in public spaces like a movie theater or a train) has appeared to be an issue in US cases, this form of transmission appeared to be less common in China, STAT reported. According to the World Health Organization, transmission in the country mainly occurred among family members and people in close contact with infected patients.\n\nChina appeared to have domestic infections under control, but a small uptick of cases has appeared across Asia. Many health officials have attributed the new COVID-19 cases to \"imported infections,\" or cases from individuals who have recently arrived from other hard-hit countries in Europe and North America.\n\nAs China slowly begins to lift the restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the virus, other countries are only now ramping up efforts to battle the coronavirus. One-third of the world is currently under lockdown, and public health officials maintain that testing individuals for the virus and social distancing are the best ways to combat the pandemic until we have a vaccine.\n\n\"Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat, and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictions,\" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a press conference on Wednesday. \"They are also the best way to prevent them.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business

of the coronavirus threatening to overwhelm hospitals.\n\n\"We have to put the country to work,\" he said on Fox News. \"You are going to lose a number of people to the flu, but you are going to lose more people by putting the country in a massive recession or depression.\"\n\n\"You are going to lose people.

In the US, nearly 50,000 people have been infected, and almost 600 people have died. In hard-hit New York, the number of cases has surpassed 25,000.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo painted a terribly bleak picture of the situation in his state during a Tuesday morning press briefing. \"We're not slowing it, and it is accelerating on its own,\" he said, adding that the rate of new infections in the state is doubling every three days.\n\nHe predicted that similar situations are likely in California, Washington, and Illinois.\n\nEven as others raise concerns, Trump is determined to restart the US economy. \"Our country wasn't built to be shut down. This is not a country that was built for this. It was not built to be shut down,\" Trump said Monday evening.\n\n\"People get tremendous anxiety and depression, and you have suicides over things like this, when you have terrible economies,\" he said, adding that deaths caused by the economy \"definitely would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we're talking about with regard to the virus.\"\n\nIncreases in suicides have been reported during past periods of economic instability. At the same time, some experts have estimated that as many as 1 million Americans could die as a result of the coronavirus if it is left untreated.\n\n\"America will again, and soon, be open for business,\" Trump said Monday night.\n\nThe president's comments on re-opening the US followed a move several hours earlier by the United Kingdom to lock down the entire country, a move other European countries have had to take to prevent the spread of the virus.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_pickrell@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ryan Pickrell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Cuomo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number_Theory", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number Theory", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5d4f509ad0c4365be9236082?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5632860", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 27371, "pinterest": 5}, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 27376, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "6008694794", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-26", "time": "13:49:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-26T13:49:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-26T13:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-spain-says-rapid-tests-sent-from-china-missing-cases-2020-3", "title": "Spain, Europe's worst-hit country after Italy, says coronavirus tests it bought from China are failing to detect positive cases", "body": "Spain discovered that rapid coronavirus tests bought from China do not identify a high enough number of cases, and is returning them to the manufacturer.

The US Centers for Disease Control says that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires rapid tests for influenza to have 80% sensitivity.\n\nThese studies prompted the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology to formally recommend that these tests are not used, El Pa\u00eds reported. Health workers are now instead meant to use other tests that take longer to give a result.\n\nFernando Sim\u00f3n, the director Spain's Center for Health Alerts and Emergencies, said on Thursday that Spain checked 9,000 of the tests, found their results were not good enough, and decided to return them.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Donald Trump wordt ongeduldig en wil de coronamaatregelen het liefst volgende week be\u00ebindigen\n\nFoto: A doctor on the front line of the coronavirus fight in Spain.

New tests approved by the government will be rolled out instead, he said.\n\nThe tests were being used in the regions of Andalucia and Galicia, and they were first put to use in the Madrid region on Wednesday.\n\nDelays from implementing the new test will further harm Spain's efforts to contain the virus, which had killed more than 4,000 people in the country as of early on March 26.\n\nThe tests were made by Chinese biotechnology company Bioeasy, El Pa\u00eds reported. The company's tests have also been bought by other countries including Georgia.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Spain said on Twitter on Thursday that the medical supplies being donated by China to other infected countries do not include Bioeasy products.\n\nIt said the Chinese Ministry of Commerce gave Spain a list of manufacturers, and that Bioeasy was not among them.\n\nIt said the company has not yet been given a licence from China's National Administration of Medical Products to sell its products.\n\nFoto: People on a balcony in Barcelona, Spain on March 15, 2020.

It is unclear how many of these were manufactured by Bioeasy.\n\nMedical professionals in the Czech Republic also said that rapid tests bought frm China are not working properly, but it is not clear if these tests were also made by Bioeasy.\n\nSpain's deaths are behind only Italy, which has been ravaged by the virus that first originated in China at the end of 2019. Spain's cases have climbed to more than 56,000 - the fourth-highest in the world, behind only China, Italy, and the US.\n\nAs the outbreak has slowed in China - which is now frequently reporting no new daily domestic cases - the country has turned to donating medical equipment like masks and tests to other countries, as well as sending medical staff.\n\nRapid tests can get a result in 10 or 15 minutes, but are generally less accurate than other tests.

Fifty-one USPS employees had tested positive for COVID-19 as of Wednesday, and 2,000 of its roughly 500,000 employees are in quarantine. Financially, lawmakers warned this week that plummeting mail volumes could force the USPS to shut down by June without immediate financial help. The USPS is included in the $2 trillion stimulus bill that President Donald Trump signed on Friday, but the city carriers' union called the $10 billion provision for the service \"woefully inadequate.\" Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe US Postal Service is in crisis, with lawmakers warning that plunging mail volumes could shut it down entirely by June without \"urgent\" financial help - threatening everything from critical medicine deliveries and vote by mail to a third of Amazon orders.\n\nBut the crisis is far more than financial. The National Association of Letter Carriers, the union representing USPS city carriers, said 51 USPS employees had tested positive for COVID-19 as of Wednesday. On top of that, nearly 2,000 were in quarantine.\n\n\"As the number of confirmed positive coronavirus cases have increased throughout the general public, so too have been the number of postal employees who have tested positive,\" a statement from the union's president, Fredric Rolando, read. \"About half of the postal employees are quarantined by order of public health officials and half have chosen to self-quarantine.\"\n\nThe union announced the coronavirus-related death of New York City carrier Rakkhon Kim, who was 50, on Thursday.\n\nAbout 150 employees have returned from quarantine, the statement said. \"Eligible\" workers ordered to quarantine by health officials are being paid administrative leave during the quarantine period, while those who choose to quarantine themselves must take sick leave.\n\n\"Employees who do not feel safe working in the facility may be allowed to take emergency annual leave or leave without pay, to the extent feasible,\" the statement quoted the USPS as saying. \"The Postal Service will follow a liberal leave usage policy for employees.\"\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Duitse autotoeleverancier Bosch heeft een coronatest ontwikkeld die binnen 2,5 uur uitsluitsel geeft\n\nAs of this writing, there have been more than 576,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 26,400 deaths worldwide. On Thursday, the US passed Italy and China for most confirmed cases in the world.\n\nThe USPS recorded having just under 497,000 employees in 2019 compared to the 2,000 currently in quarantine, meaning numbers are relatively low. But the numbers worldwide don't accurately reflect the exact number of cases due to limited testing, nor do they immediately convey the infectiousness of the disease - which has a snowball effect that one expert broke down, explaining how one person could end up infecting 59,000.\n\nPostal employees, like others considered essential - arguably, in some cases - are also still at work, handling packages and touching surfaces where the coronavirus can live for up to several days.\n\nThe USPS, the union said, has agreed to certain provisions during the pandemic, including: providing daily supplies for employees to clean office items and vehicles; providing hand sanitizer and other cleaning supplies for postal carriers; and providing masks and protective gloves for any employee who requests them.\n\n\"We have received almost 3,000 reports from all over the country regarding these issues,\" the union statement said. \"In some places, all of these things are being done. However, in too many places they are not.\n\n\"In the places where there are not enough supplies, or none at all, it is generally due to the overall shortage of these items throughout the country. USPS has been working to acquire more items, even authorizing local managers to purchase them if they could be found.\"\n\nCarriers are also being advised to knock instead of ringing doorbells, keep a safe distance from others, and use an alternative method for signed deliveries - all while the USPS itself fights to stay alive.\n\nTwo US representatives warned this week that the USPS could shut down in three months without financial help, introducing a bill that would give the service $25 billion in emergency funding, eliminate its current debt, and require it to prioritize medical deliveries.\n\nThe union said Friday that Congress must provide \"at least $25 billion\" to the USPS \"to both protect the public health and to stabilize our economy,\" but the $2 trillion stimulus bill signed by President Donald Trump on Friday includes only $10 billion to the Postal Service.\n\nThe bill passed in the Senate with the language that the USPS could prioritize medical deliveries, and that \"if the Postal Service determines that, due to the COVID-19 emergency, the Postal Service will not be able to fund operating expenses without borrowing money,\" the USPS would be allowed to borrow up to $10 billion from the Treasury \"to be used for such operating expenses\" and \"which may not be used to pay any outstanding debt of the Postal Service.\"\n\nThe USPS lost $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2018, according to a report from the Task Force on the United States Postal System, and lost $62.4 billion between fiscal years 2007 and 2016. The report said that as the service's financial condition \"continues to deteriorate,\" it's expected to \"lose tens of billions of dollars over the next decade\" - if it makes it that far.\n\nThe union called the $10 billion in the stimulus package \"woefully inadequate,\" considering that the USPS' services \"are needed more than ever.\"\n\n\"Right now we are delivering notices for the decennial census, CDC pamphlets for households, and a large volume of e-commerce products at a time when retail options are limited,\" a statement said. \"Soon we will likely handle the distribution of Treasury stimulus checks, home virus testing kits and a surge of absentee ballots later this year.\n\n\"In view [of] the Postal Service's crucial role, it is all the more disappointing and discouraging that the $2 trillion stimulus legislation that is about to be adopted did so little to help.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"},

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that he has repeatedly asked Trump to provide federal aid as the city's coronavirus cases continue to spike.\n\n\"The President of the United States is from New York City, and he will not lift a finger to help his hometown,\" de Blasio said. \"And I do not get it. I do not get it.\"\n\n\"I can't be blunt enough. If the president does not act, people will die who could have lived otherwise,\" he added.\n\nIllinois Gov.

Shortages of other medical gear like masks have already started to affect US hospitals.\n\nSome states have called on private companies and individuals to help provide medical supplies where possible.

That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they've been doing it since he got in. It's all turning, they lost. It's all turning, think of it, think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that's been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.\"\n\nWhile the ad appears to be misleading, Trump and his administration repeatedly downplayed the coronavirus or delivered mixed messages about the seriousness of the pandemic, prior to the White House issuing its 15-day coronavirus isolation guidelines. And despite the warnings from public health professionals, Trump has said he'd like to reopen businesses by Easter.\n\nAt least 1,050 people in the US had died from the new coronavirus as of early Thursday morning.\n\n\"The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,\" Trump tweeted on February 24. \"We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart.\"\n\nAbout 69,000 cases have been reported in all 50 states, Washington, DC, and US territories.

back to work and 'see what happens'", "body": "President Donald Trump said he wants to \"reopen\" the economy by April 12, even as experts say there's little chance the pandemic will be contained by then.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis in the United States is only just beginning. But it's not too early for some Americans to flout social distancing and isolation guidelines and return to work, according to some executives.\n\nDick Kovacevich, the former CEO and chairman of Wells Fargo, told Bloomberg News that healthy workers under the age of 55 should return to work in April if the outbreak is controlled, saying that \"some may even die\" with his plan.\n\n\"We'll gradually bring those people back and see what happens. Some of them will get sick, some may even die, I don't know,\" said Kovacevich, a current executive at Cisco and Cargill. \"Do you want to suffer more economically or take some risk that you'll get flu-like symptoms and a flu-like experience? Do you want to take an economic risk or a health risk? You get to choose.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he wants to \"reopen\" the economy by April 12, even as deaths from COVID-19 continue to mount in the US, because he'd like to see \"packed churches all over our country\" for Easter.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be great to have all of the churches full? You know the churches aren't allowed, essentially, to have much of a congregation there,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"You'll have packed churches all over our country. I think it would be a beautiful time.\"\n\nKovacevich isn't the only former bank executive pushing for economic activity despite the risk of increased infections and death. Lloyd Blankfein, the former head of Goldman Sachs \"on a gap year\" according to his Twitter bio, called on Sunday for \"those with a lower risk to the disease to return to work.\"\n\n\"Crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue-and beyond,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.\"\n\nA server at an Olive Garden restaurant, 63-year-old Jim Conway, had no interest in heeding the multi-billionaire's advice. Conway, who was laid off from his Pennsylvania location two weeks ago, is \"in no hurry to go back in the middle of an epidemic,\" he told Bloomberg News. \"Being a server means you're in contact with lots of different people, and puts you at bigger risk of getting infected. I'm kind of glad they closed when they did.\"\n\n\"They've never really had our interests at heart,\" added Conway, who is waiting on unemployment benefits from the federal government. \"And now would be a weird time to start.\"\n\nDallas Mavericks owner and venture capitalist Mark Cuban disagreed with Kovacevich and Blankfein, saying their advice should be disregarded.\n\n\"Ignore anything someone like me might say,\" he wrote in an email to Bloomberg News. \"Lives are at stake.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tate Reeves, declared that businesses such as gun shops, real estate offices, home repair services, banks, mass transit, and Uber and Lyft cars were essential.\n\nReeves closed public schools on March 19, and declared a state of emergency on March 23. As of Thursday, Mississippi has recorded 377 cases and five deaths of the virus, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe executive order, issued on Tuesday, urged employees to work from home \"where feasible,\" but also underlined that a vast list of types of business were still \"critical\" to maintaining community, public health, and the economy.\n\nThe order advised citizens to avoid gatherings of more than ten people, but added that \"this does not apply\" to a list of places including offices, airports, and grocery and department stores.\n\nThe order overrides a raft of public-health responses that had previously been called for or enacted by authorities below the state level.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Donald Trump wordt ongeduldig en wil de coronamaatregelen het liefst volgende week be\u00ebindigen\n\nIt said: \"Any order, rule, regulation or action by any governing body, agency or political subdivision of the state that imposes any additional freedom of movement or social distancing limitations on Essential Business or Operation, restricts scope of services or hours of operation of any Essential Business or Operation, or which will or might in any way conflict with or impede the purpose of this Executive Order is suspended and unenforceable during this COVID-19 State of Emergency.\"\n\nFoto: Jackson Medical Mall in Mississippi.

$2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package", "body": "\"It's a pretty big deal,\" Peter Buell, of the accounting firm Marcum, told The Times.\n\nA provision slipped into the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package by Senate Republicans enables wealthy real estate investors to reduce their tax burden, The New York Times reported Thursday.\n\nDesigned to benefit households with over $500,000 in nonbusiness income, the measure allows investors to apply on-paper losses from falling property values to their bill with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe change will cost the IRS an estimated $170 billion over the next decade, The Times reported, characterizing it as \"a potential bonanza for America's richest real estate investors.\"\n\nAs the financial website Motley Fool explains, \"Depreciation can dramatically reduce taxable income on rental profits.\" Under current tax law, a married couple can already apply up to $500,000 in depreciation -- the gradual, IRS-determined cost of maintaining a property -- to their tax bill. The stimulus package lifts that cap for a three-year period.\n\n\"It's a pretty big deal,\" Peter Buell, of the accounting firm Marcum, told The Times. And it benefits the top 1% of taxpayers, making an existing aspect of tax law into a windfall, for some.\n\nAs The Times notes, Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, was able to avoid paying any taxes in 2018 by applying on-paper, if not actually realized, losses from ample property investments.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charles_davis@businessinsider.com", "name": "Charles Davis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_deduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax deduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Garcetti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Garcetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Firms", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Firms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real Estate", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/c2bb72585608e0c45c0e6fb9ceff5bf3f40edd7b.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 15194}, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 15194, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "6010297040", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-27", "time": "17:04:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-27T17:04:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-27T17:03:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8666666746139526, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/holland-american-coronavirus-covid-19-zaandam-rotterdam-2020-3", "title": "Leaked audio reveals 4 Holland America passengers have died and 2 have tested positive for COVID-19 onboard the stranded Zaandam ship. And now the cruise line is scrambling to rescue healthy passengers", "body": "Are you a cruise ship passenger or employee with a story to share? Email acain@businessinsider.com.\n\nFour passengers have died onboard Holland America's stranded MS Zaandam cruise, according to a recording leaked to Business Insider from a sister ship sent to rescue healthy passengers from the stricken ship.\n\n\"I am also sad to share that four older Zaandam guests have passed away,\" the captain of the MS Rotterdam said in a recording of a shipwide announcement provided to Business Insider. \"Three between yesterday and last night, and one a few days ago. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and the Zaandam team is doing everything they can to support them during this difficult time.\"\n\nA Holland America crew member sent Business Insider a recording of the Rotterdam's captain announcing the deaths, as well as news from medical staffers confirming at least two cases of COVID-19 on board the Zaandam. The Rotterdam rendezvoused with the Zaandam last night off the coast of Ecuador to deliver medical supplies, including COVID-19 tests. The Rotterdam currently has no guests on board, but crew members on the ship say it is staffed with a crew of 611.\n\nAnd, according to a March 25 memo leaked by a Rotterdam crew member, the ship is now also tasked with rescuing healthy Zaandam guests. The crew member also sent Business Insider pictures of a printed memo dated March 25 and titled \"Rotterdam Humanitarian Mission FAQ.\" The rescue response memo began with the question: \"Why do we need to do this?\"\n\n\"This is a humanitarian action to help a sister ship which has an outbreak of respiratory illness mainly affecting your team mates particularly food preparation and service staff,\" the Rotterdam memo said. \"There is no other place for us to take the guests and no other means to provide assistance to the Zaandam and our fellow team members on board.\"\n\nA Holland America spokesperson confirmed the course of action outlined in the memo in a statement to Business Insider.\n\n\"Today we announced a plan to transfer groups of healthy Zaandam guests to Rotterdam, with strict protocols for this process developed in conjunction with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\" the spokesperson said. \"Only those who have not been ill will be moved, and health screenings will be conducted before transferring. Priority for the first guests to transfer will be given to those on Zaandam with inside staterooms and who are over 70.\"\n\nThe leaked memo went on to say that ports and airports South America and Central America have been closed off to the Zaandam, and that \"colleagues, fleet family members, and guests\" on board \"are in dire need.\" There were originally 1,243 guests and 586 crew members on the Zaandam. The ship's passengers have been confined to their state rooms on March 22, with crew members relegated to delivering meals and collecting trash from each cabin.\n\nThe memo described a plan to sail the Rotterdam northwest, up to the United States, predicting that the ship could reach San Diego in about a week depending on its \"fuel and provisions supply.\" From there, the Rotterdam would \"disembark all guests and fly them home.\"\n\nOnly \"well guests\" would be elgible for the ship transfer, meaning anyone \"showing no signs of illness, including fever.\" Sick guests and their \"close contacts\" would remain behind on the Zaandam. The document does not specify the plan for healthy Zaandam crew members.\n\nThe memo noted that members of the Zaandam \"crew are showing influenza-like symptoms, such as fever and cough.\" Business Insider reported that 86 crew members and 58 guests had fallen ill, based on conversations with Zaandam passengers. The Rotterdam would resupply its sister ship with medical staff, supplies, and equipment, as well as \"a number of COVID-19 test kits for use in identifying whether or not the illness is on board.\"\n\nPassengers would be transferred onto the Rotterdam through a \"secure corridor\" that would \"take them directly to their staterooms.\" As per that plan, no crew members from the Rotterdam would \"come into close contact with anybody transferred and en route to their stateroom.\" All rescued guests would be required to \"stay in isolation in their staterooms\" for the duration of the journey, and meals will be provided through contactless delivery.\n\nWhen it comes to personal protective equipment, the memo said that the Rotterdam crew would have enough surgical masks and gloves for the estimated seven to 10 day voyage up to the United States. It said that PPE would be \"provided to wear based on their individual risk,\" singling out at-risk teams like medical, hotel, technical, and deck staffers.\n\nRotterdam crew members have told Business Insider that, despite the memo's attempts to quell their fears, they are frightened of becoming sick. They spoke of feeling that they were left without much of a choice by Holland America.\n\n\"Our crew do not agree and they did not give us any choice about it,\" one crew member said. \"We will have to serve guests possible infected by COVID-19 without any equipment or instruction.\"\n\nThe crew member said they felt that Holland America \"did not care for the health of our crew\" by tasking the Rotterdam with the mission. The memo also repeatedly referenced crew members' concerns regarding safety.\n\n\"The chances that anyone will beome ill from well guests is very low,\" the memo said. \"There is a higher chance of becoming ill traveling through an airport to get home than there is on the ship.\" It also noted that once at the port in the United States, these \"well guests\" will be \"allowed to freely disembark go to a hotel or fly home with no restrictions.\"\n\n\"These guests are healthier than most people who travel, sail, and fly every day,\" the memo added. It said that crew members have a greater likelihood of being exposed to illness on their international flights home.\n\nThe document also provided Rotterdam crew members with a statement to give to family members. It described the transfer as \"part of a humanitarian crisis mission in which the Rotterdam team is coming to the rescue of the Zaandam guests and crew.\"\n\nRotterdam crew members uncomfortable with the mission ought to \"let us know how you feel and what your concerns honestly are,\" according to the memo.\n\n\"We should mention that nobody will be asked to do something that they don't want to do,\" the memo said. \"But we would like you to think about your fellow team members on board Zaandam and the guests who are elderly and need your help, and what one would hope they would do for the Rotterdam team if you ended up in the same situation -- as that could have been easily been the case.\"\n\n\"Again, nobody will be pushed to do something that doesn't feel right to them,\" the document added.\n\nThe memo said that the situation onboard the Zaandam \"escalated very rapidly,\" as an explanation for why crew members were not kept more aware of the nature of their mission aboard on the Rotterdam.\n\n\"We are mariners, and we consider this our duty and our obligation and so in the tradition we are proceeding with helping our sister ship the Zaandam,\" the captain of the Rotterdam said in the leaked audio. \"Our guests and our fellow crew members on board need us. There are no easy choices here. In order to protect the Zaandam guests and crew members we need to move guests to the Rotterdam.\"\n\nZaandam is currently off the coast of Panama and rendezvoused with sister ship Rotterdam at 7:30 p.m. local time yesterday, March 26. We received approval from Panamanian authorities to conduct ship-to-ship operations at anchor between the two vessels. Medical supplies and additional medical staff were transferred to Zaandam.\n\nToday we announced a plan to transfer groups of healthy Zaandam guests to Rotterdam, with strict protocols for this process developed in conjunction with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Only those who have not been ill will be moved, and health screenings will be conducted before transferring. Priority for the first guests to transfer will be given to those on Zaandam with inside staterooms and who are over 70. Once aboard Rotterdam, all guests will continue to remain in their staterooms until disembarkation. Any guests who are currently ill, or in isolation as a close contact, and all crew will remain on Zaandam.\n\nWhile the onward plan for both ships is still being finalized, we continue to work with the Panamanian authorities on approval to transit the Panama Canal for sailing to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nYesterday a number of patients with respiratory symptoms were tested for COVID-19 and two individuals tested positive. Out of an abundance of caution, on March 22 when Zaandam first saw a number of guests reporting to the medical center with influenza-like illness symptoms, we took immediate protective measures, including asking all guests to self-isolate in their staterooms and implementing all other appropriate precautions that have been developed in coordination with the CDC. All guests and crew received face masks yesterday and were provided with instructions on when and how to wear them.\n\nCurrently, 53 guests (4%) and 85 crew (14%) have reported to Zaandam's medical center with influenza-like illness symptoms. There are 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board. On Zaandam there are four doctors and four nurses. On Rotterdam there are two doctors and four nurses.\n\nHolland America Line can confirm that four older guests have passed away on Zaandam. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and we are doing everything we can to support them during this difficult time.\n\nComplimentary telephone counseling services from our care partner, Empathia, have been made available to guests and crew if they would like extra support during this time. For those with family members on board, they can call the following numbers for information: 877-425-2231 or 206-626-7398.\n\nZaandam was sailing a South America cruise that departed Buenos Aires, Argentina, on March 7 and was originally scheduled to end at San Antonio, Chile, on March 21. Due to global health concerns, Holland America Line made the decision to suspend its global cruise operations for 30 days and end its current cruises in progress as quickly as possible so guests could return home. No one has been off the ship since March 14 in Punta Arenas, Chile.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":
