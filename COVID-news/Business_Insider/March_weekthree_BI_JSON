It includes plans to send checks to Americans in about two weeks, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Tuesday.\n\nBut Mnuchin's \"two weeks\" turned into \"before the end of April\" in a meeting with Senate Republicans immediately after the press conference. After that it went back to early April, but the payment -- at least for poor Americans -- became less generous.\n\nAccording to a bill released on Thursday, Republicans are talking about prioritizing money for \"taxpayers\" (by which they mean only income tax, not things like sales tax that all Americans pay). Under this plan, Americans who make less than $75,000 would get up to $1,200, while poor families who pay less in taxes would get $600.\n\nIt's also been reported that GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Mark Meadows, the soon-to-be White House chief of staff, were trying to persuade Trump to reject these cash payments altogether.\n\nThis idea is ludicrous, stingy, and harmful to our economy and society in crisis.\n\nIn fact, there are a bunch of ideas in this bill that would do nothing to help struggling Americans:\n\nAll of that is stomach-churning, but the worst part is what will happen to low-income families. Punishing the poorest Americans at a time like this not only is callous but would slow our economy's recovery. If there's anything we've learned from China's experience with the coronavirus outbreak, it's that you want to keep the economy going as normally as possible while people are practicing social distancing. That means ensuring that they can pay as many bills as possible and that they have money in their pockets to spend again when the social distancing is over.\n\nWe need to be generous to everyone* right now. It's the only way we're going to get through this with minimal damage. Unemployment claims are about to explode, with data from 15 states putting them somewhere around 600,000, and it's possible that as many as 1 million people could file for unemployment insurance over the next week. Wall Street is coming to terms with the idea that this could be the worst global recession since World War II.\n\nHouse Democrats are trying to put together a more generous plan, offering Americans $2,000 a month with an additional $1,000 for every child until the crisis is over. This is more like it. But this all needs to move faster.

Their plight highlights an ongoing controversy over how companies have been spending their money.", "body": "Their pushback is reminiscent of past criticisms relating to how companies have spent excess capital.\n\nThe Trump administration has responded to the airline industry's request and proposed a $50 billion bailout as part of its massive $1 trillion stimulus package. The ultimate goal is to jolt the American economy by flooding it with cash.\n\nMajor airlines are reeling from massive wave of cancellations as Americans stay home and governments around the world implement travel bans to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"We cannot afford to wait long for assistance,\" the trade association Airlines for America said in a statement, warning that some companies could be bankrupt by June.\n\nBut there's a catch. Over the past decade, major airlines - including Delta Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest - have used roughly 96% of their available cash on stock buybacks, according to Bloomberg. By reducing share count, these repurchases have pushed stock prices higher.\n\nIn the process, they've drawn criticism for how they boost shareholder returns without directly helping businesses. The activity is central to a broader discussion about how companies use their cash - and whether they should be doing something different.\n\nRead more: GOLDMAN SACHS: Buy these 13 stocks poised to dominate in a market where everyone is paralyzed by fear\n\nSome experts argue that these companies should have instead used those proceeds to build themselves a financial cushion or address labor issues. Tim Wu, a Columbia University professor, targeted American Airlines in a recent New York Times op-ed.\n\n\"It could have stored up its cash reserves for a future crisis, knowing that airlines regularly cycle through booms and busts,\" Wu wrote. \"It might have tried to decisively settle its continuing contract disputes with pilots, flight attendants and mechanics.\"\n\nHe added: \"It might have invested heavily in better service quality to try to repair its longstanding reputation as the worst of the major carriers.\"\n\nRead more: An investment chief whose ETF has surged 24% during the coronavirus meltdown details his strategy for profiting during stock-market crashes\n\nGoing beyond academia, the prospect of an airline bailout also a wave of criticism from prominent Democrats, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.\n\n\"96% of airline profits over the last decade went to buying up their own stocks to juice the price - not raising wages or other investments,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. \"If there is so much as a DIME of corporate bailout money in the next relief package, it should include a reinstated ban on stock buybacks.\"\n\nEven some Republicans came out against the idea of the government coming to the rescue of the battered airline industry.\n\n\"I do not believe in the bailouts for the companies, period ... They are smart people and will figure it out,\" Florida Sen. Rick Scott said.\n\nDisdain for buybacks - and companies' propensity to do them as much as possible - is hardly a new phenomenon. Following the GOP tax plan that went into effect in 2018, corporations across all industries came under fire for how they spent their proceeds.\n\nLed by the tech and finance sectors, buybacks peaked to a record in 2018, according to a according to JPMorgan. For many, the takeaway was simple: These companies were electing to enrich shareholders, rather than invest in their businesses and labor forces.\n\nThe pending airline bailout will also likely remind many of the financial relief provided to major Wall Street banks in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. Congress' $700 billion legislative package was known as the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and it set up a mechanism for the federal government to buy mortgage-backed securities that had gone bad.\n\nRead more: 'Practically stealing': Jefferies mapped out dozens of cheap stocks worth owning in a coronavirus-stricken market. Here are 10 of their top picks.\n\nTARP invested around $426.4 billion and ultimately recouped $441.7 billion, making a profit for taxpayers. But critics of the program argued it came with no strings attached and rewarded Wall Street for its bad behavior.\n\nSome current lawmakers are learning from the past and pushing for different bailout terms compared to a 12 years ago. Sen. Elizabeth Warren demanded tougher conditions on Tuesday, saying any bailout should require a company to maintain existing payrolls and refrain from buybacks, dividends, and executive bonuses for at least three years.\n\nThere's ultimately a crucial distinction to consider, according to Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union.\n\n\"We won't let this to look like the bank bailout of 2008, nor can you compare the two,\" Nelson wrote on Twitter. \"The airline industry didn't cause the pandemic and money should come with significant conditions to help workers and keep planes flying, not enrich shareholders or pad executive bonuses.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"Amazon is suspending all shipments other than medical supplies and household staples to its warehouses amid coronavirus crisis  --  read the memo it just sent sellers", "body": "\"We are temporarily prioritizing household staples, medical supplies, and other high-demand products coming into our fulfillment centers so that we can more quickly receive, restock, and deliver these products to customers,\" the message read.\n\nAmazon is blocking all shipments of nonessential products to its warehouses in response to the significant increase in orders it's seeing as the novel coronavirus spreads across the US.\n\nOn Tuesday the company told sellers and vendors that it would accept only shipments of \"household staples, medical supplies, and other high-demand products\" to its warehouse until April 5 to deal with the high demand of those products amid the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThat means sellers who use Amazon's storage and delivery network for a fixed fee, through a program called Fulfillment by Amazon, will no longer be able to ship nonessential products to Amazon. The same restrictions apply to vendors who wholesale their products to Amazon, who then resells them at a markup.\n\nIt doesn't affect last-mile shipments of those products to consumers.\n\nAmazon said in an email to sellers that it was now prioritizing shipment in the following six categories: baby product; health and household (including personal-care appliances); beauty and personal care; grocery; industrial and scientific; pet supplies.\n\n\"We are seeing increased online shopping, and as a result some products such as household staples and medical supplies are out of stock,\" the email obtained by Business Insider said. \"With this in mind, we are temporarily prioritizing household staples, medical supplies, and other high-demand products coming into our fulfillment centers so that we can more quickly receive, restock, and deliver these products to customers.\"\n\nThe move follows huge increases in orders of certain products on Amazon, like face masks and toilet paper, as more shoppers flocked to e-commerce sites like Amazon for their shopping. That's put huge strains on Amazon's supple chain, resulting in shipment delays, technical glitches, and labor shortages.\n\n\"Amazon is taking drastic measures to address logistical challenges faced amid the coronavirus pandemic,\" Steven Yates, CEO of Prime Guidance, an agency that helps Amazon sellers, said. \"Amazon has struggled to keep up with demand on essential items, so this move will allow them to focus more available resources to meet this increased demand.\"\n\nFor the vendors, Amazon said they would see \"reduced purchase orders\" as it \"temporarily paused\" orders for all non-essential products until April 5. It also extended the delivery windows for existing orders, giving vendors more time to deliver those products to Amazon.\n\n\"We understand this is a change to your business, and we did not take this decision lightly,\" Amazon wrote in the note. \"We appreciate your understanding as we prioritize the above products for our customers.\"\n\nA group of vendors told Business Insider earlier this week that some changes were expected, as Amazon stopped placing purchase orders that it normally does on Mondays. They suspected Amazon was only placing orders in high demand because it ran out of stock for household staples over the weekend.\n\n\"We would like to notify you, due to the current health concerns, we are taking actions to prevent more health issues. We will share more information in the upcoming days,\" Amazon wrote to one of the vendors who asked about the order change on Monday.\n\nYates said sellers of nonessential goods have seen their sales drop by 40% to 60% on Amazon lately, as shoppers significantly cut back on discretionary spending during the coronavirus outbreak. While many of the sellers have 30 to 60 days' worth of inventory in stock, Yates said they are scrambling to figure out how to deal with the changing shopping behavior.\n\nOther sellers are now storing and shipping their products on their own, instead of using Amazon's fulfillment service, according to Will Tjernlund, the CMO of Goat Consulting, an agency that helps Amazon sellers. For example, they are now fulfilling their products out of their own warehouses, using services like Amazon's Seller Fulfilled Prime, which still gives their products Prime eligibility and better exposure on the site, even if they don't ship them to Amazon's warehouses.\n\n\"It may be difficult for some sellers to ship every item themselves, but if they want to have their products for sale on Amazon, they have no other choice until April 5,\" Tjernlund told Business Insider.\n\nOn Monday, Amazon also announced that it was hiring an additional 100,000 employees in its warehouse and delivery networks. It also said that it would raise their pay by $2 per hour through April, as the coronavirus causes an \"unprecedented\" increase in demand for this time of year.\n\nHere's the full message from Amazon:\n\nHello from Fulfillment by Amazon, We are closely monitoring the developments of COVID-19 and its impact on our customers, selling partners, and employees. We are seeing increased online shopping, and as a result some products such as household staples and medical supplies are out of stock. With this in mind, we are temporarily prioritizing household staples, medical supplies, and other high-demand products coming into our fulfillment centers so that we can more quickly receive, restock, and deliver these products to customers. For products other than these, we have temporarily disabled shipment creation. We are taking a similar approach with retail vendors. This will be in effect today through April 5, 2020, and we will let you know once we resume regular operations. Shipments created before today will be received at fulfillment centers. You can learn more about this on this Help page. Please note that Selling Partner Support does not have further guidance. We understand this is a change to your business, and we did not take this decision lightly. We are working around the clock to increase capacity and yesterday announced that we are opening 100,000 new full- and part-time positions in our fulfillment centers across the US. We appreciate your understanding as we prioritize the above products for our customers. Thank you for your patience, and for participating in FBA.\n\nCorrection: The original headline on this article has been updated to clarify that Amazon is prioritizing essential shipments to its warehouses and is not suspending nonessential shipments to consumers.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eugene_kim@businessinsider.com", "name": "Eugene Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulfillment_house", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulfillment house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Products and Services", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e70cdb2c485400d5d2357d3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5606415", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 49915, "pinterest": 15}, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 49930, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6003598343", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-22", "time": "18:42:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-22T18:42:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-22T18:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-cuomo-stay-at-home-orders-could-last-for-months-2020-3", "title": "New York's governor just warned that the coronavirus' spread could last as long as 9 months, with up to 80% of the population getting the virus", "body": "\"It is going to be four months, six months, nine months,\" the governor said.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo says New Yorkers should be prepared for widespread business closings and stay-at-home orders to last months to combat the surge in coronavirus cases.\n\n\"This is not a short-term situation,\" he said in a Sunday briefing with reporters. \"This is not a long weekend. This is not a week.\"\n\n\"It is going to be four months, six months, nine months,\" he continued.\n\nCuomo pointed to modeling from China indicating that the US is lagging in its capacity to curb the rate at which the virus is spreading in hot spots like New York City.\n\n\"The timeline -- nobody can tell you, it depends on how we handle it -- but 40%, up to 80% of the population will wind up getting this virus,\" Cuomo said. \"All we're trying to do is slow the spread. But it will spread -- it is that contagious.\"\n\nCuomo said there were 15,168 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 76 deaths in New York state, up from 10,356 on Saturday -- a nearly 50% increase. More than 9,000 cases are in New York City. To put that in perspective, Washington state, an early US hot spot for the coronavirus, has reported about 1,800 cases.\n\nNew York state has made a push to make testing more available to New York City residents, opening up a drive-thru testing site in Staten Island, which Cuomo said could explain the rapid increase in confirmed cases.\n\n\"It's going to be hard -- I'm not minimizing it, but it's going to be OK,\" Cuomo said. \"The grocery stores will continue to function, they're going to have food, the transportation system will function, the pharmacies are going to be open. All essential services will be maintained.\"\n\nWhile younger people are less at risk of becoming seriously ill or dying as a result of contracting the coronavirus, Cuomo reiterated the importance of staying at home and practicing social distancing to help curb the spread.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm saying that people don't get,\" Cuomo said. \"This is not life as usual.\"\n\nHe proposed closing some streets in New York City to car traffic to allows runners, bikers, and others who are trying to exercise and get fresh air to spread out from one another.\n\n\"You have much less traffic in New York City because nonessential workers aren't going to work,\" he said. \"Get creative: Open streets to reduce the density. You want to go for a walk? God bless you. You want to go for a run? God bless you.\"\n\nCuomo also lent some advice to families not used to being cooped up in small spaces for extended periods of time with one another.\n\n\"Now you're all in the same place for 24 hours,\" he said. \"I live alone, and I'm even getting annoyed with the dog, being in one place. So think that through, because that is real and it's going to go on for a period of time.\"\n\nCuomo called on the federal government to order companies to manufacture masks, ventilators, and other medical supplies under the Defense Production Act.\n\n\"The federal government should nationalize medical supply acquisition,\" he said. \"The states simply cannot manage it. That's why I believe the federal government should take over that function of contracting and acquiring all of the medical supplies that we need.\"\n\nNever miss out on healthcare news. Subscribe to Dispensed, Business Insider's weekly newsletter on pharma, biotech, and healthcare.\n\nHe said that because states were competing with one another for medical supplies, \"price gouging is a tremendous problem.\"\n\nFor instance, he said N95 masks the state was paying $0.85 for were costing up to $7. On top of that, ventilators range in price from $16,000 to $40,000 each, and New York needs 30,000 of them -- a situation Cuomo called \"impossible.\"\n\n\"We can lose lives that we could have otherwise saved if we had the right equipment,\" he said.\n\nThat builds off a point that Cuomo's counterpart in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio, brought up on CNN on Sunday.\n\n\"If we don't get more ventilators in the next 10 days, people will die,\" de Blasio said on CNN. Like Cuomo, de Blasio urged President Donald Trump to mobilize the military to aid New York and use the Defense Production Act to produce necessary tools like ventilators for patients.\n\n\"I can't be blunt enough,\" de Blasio said. \"If the president does not act, people will die who could have lived otherwise.\"\n\nAnd like Cuomo, de Blasio reiterated that the pandemic would continue to escalate in the coming months. \"April is going to be worse than March. And I fear May will be worse than April,\" de Blasio said on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday.\n\nThat said, Cuomo urged New Yorkers not to panic.\n\n\"There's not going to be chaos -- there's not going to be anarchy,\" Cuomo said. \"Life is going to go on.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren unveiled eight conditions on Monday that companies must accept for emergency federal funding during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe Trump administration is calling for over $50 billion to aid the airline industry, which has been battered by a wave of cancellations as the coronavirus spreads, compelling Americans to cancel travel plans and stay home. It would be part of a $1 trillion stimulus plan to shore up the economy and inject it with a deluge of cash.\n\nBut Democrats like Warren are attacking the proposed funding for airlines as a bailout. The nation's largest airlines are coming under fire from progressives for directing massive profits in recent years towards stock buybacks - which pushes up share prices - instead of increasing their financial cushion or improving labor conditions.\n\n\"Let me be clear: We're not doing no-strings-attached bailouts that enrich shareholders or pay CEO bonuses. Period,\" Warren said on Twitter.\n\nHere are Warren's eight conditions:\n\nCompanies must maintain payrolls and use federal funds to keep people working. Businesses must provide $15 an hour minimum wage quickly but no later than a year from the end Companies would be permanently banned from engaging in stock buybacks. Companies would be barred from paying out dividends or executive bonuses while they receive federal funds and the ban would be in place for three years. Businesses would have to provide at least one seat to workers on their board of directors, though it could be more depending on size of the rescue package. Collective bargaining agreements must remain in place. Corporate boards must get shareholder approval for all political spending. CEOs must certify their companies are complying with the rules and face criminal penalties for violating them.\n\nWarren's rise to prominence began in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Since then, she's repeatedly called for tougher regulations on Wall Street and the financial sector, a centerpiece of her recent presidential campaign.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider 5 manieren waarop het coronavirus de huizenmarkt raakt - voorbehoud van financiering is nu extra belangrijk\n\nRead more: GOLDMAN SACHS: Buy these 13 stocks poised to dominate in a market where everyone is paralyzed by fear\n\nIn a CNN op-ed published Monday, Warren called for an emergency rescue package that puts families first and helps them make ends meet.\n\n\"When the 2008 financial crisis hit, the federal government responded with a bankers' bailout. The rich and powerful got richer and more powerful,\" Warren wrote. \"We should learn from the past and meet the challenges of this pandemic head-on, this time to deliver meaningful, grassroots relief directly to American families.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_zeballos_roig@businessinsider.com", "name": "Joseph Zeballos-Roig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bailout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007\u20132008", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Financial_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Financial Planning", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Education and Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5defbb64fd9db2632d06edd2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5615469", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 38063}, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 38063, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1486281888", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-17", "time": "00:36:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-17T00:36:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-17T00:36:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/us-one-week-enforce-social-distancing-flatten-curve-coronavirus-2020-3", "title": "The US has 1 week to enforce social distancing and 'flatten the curve' as the coronavirus outbreak escalates. Here's why these days are so critical.", "body": "Social distancing needs to be the foundation of strict and wide-ranging containment measures, according to Bitton.\n\nThe window for the United States to pursue a wide-ranging, aggressive response to the coronavirus pandemic may be closing. Experts say the moves officials and citizens make this week are crucial and will shape the COVID-19 trajectory at a national level.\n\nThe US has recorded more than 4,000 coronavirus cases and 71 deaths. Public-health experts are urging interventions that could help \"flatten the curve\" of the outbreak -- slow the virus' spread, in other words, so that the country's healthcare system isn't overwhelmed.\n\nThe best ways to do this are to isolate people who are ill, trace who sick people had contact with to find others who might have been exposed, quarantine anyone who may have been exposed to the virus, close schools and offices, and encourage people to avoid crowds.\n\nWithout these measures, the infection rate is likely to climb quickly. But flattening the curve buys time for health providers to obtain more tests, beds, and ventilators, and to bolster their arsenal of supplies and treatments to combat the coronavirus.\n\nThis week in particular is crucial, according to Asaf Bitton, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard University and director of Ariadne Labs.\n\n\"We are only about 11 days behind Italy and generally on track to repeat what is unfortunately happening there and throughout much of the rest of Europe very soon,\" Bitton wrote on Medium on Friday, adding, \"we must move to pandemic mitigation through widespread, uncomfortable, and comprehensive social distancing.\"\n\nA new data-visualization tool from a project called Databrew uses data from Johns Hopkins to enable users to compare various outbreaks on the same time scale. The graph above aligns the US' and Italy's outbreaks based on the day each reported their 149th coronavirus cases.\n\nIt paints a grim picture: the caseload in the US (red) is growing at a rate that mirrors Italy's (black).\n\nItaly's healthcare system is already overwhelmed -- doctors are prioritizing young and mostly healthy COVID-19 patients because their chances of survival eclipse those of the elderly.\n\nIn the US, Bitton wrote, there are about 45,000 staffed ICU beds on any given day. That number can be boosted to roughly 95,000 in a crisis, but that's still not enough for an immense influx of coronavirus cases.\n\n\"Even moderate projections suggest that if current infectious trends hold, our capacity (locally and nationally) may be overwhelmed as early as mid-late April. Thus, the only strategies that can get us off this concerning trajectory are those that enable us to work together as a community to maintain public health by staying apart,\" Bitton said.\n\nTina Nguyen, a reporter at Politico, shared screenshots on Twitter of a text-message conversation with another public-health researcher who also emphasized how crucial this week is.\n\nThe source explained that people who ignore calls for social distancing and contract the infection may take around 10 days to present symptoms. (The average incubation period, according to studies, is actually about five days.) However, \"the people they get sick are the ones who will die,\" the source said, because \"that's the wave that overwhelms hospital capacity.\"\n\nAs of Monday, coronavirus cases have been reported in some 150 countries, with more than 179,000 people infected and over 7,000 dead. Localized outbreaks have been reported in South Korea, Iran, Italy, and now a broad swath of Europe.\n\nIn countries like China and Italy, where people were not isolated immediately when just a few cases were reported, the number of infected people seemed to skyrocket overnight. The reason for this is the virus' exponential growth trajectory. Studies so far suggest that an average patient infects 2.5 other people, who then pass the virus on to 2.5 more people each.\n\nThis troubling infection rate will not level off unless people, infected or not, cut down on social contact.\n\nSome ways of maintaining social distance include closing schools and public spaces, canceling children's group activities, avoiding visits to friends' homes, staying 6 feet away from people when stepping outside of our homes, and cutting down on non-essential trips to stores. Anyone who feels sick should isolate themselves and contact a doctor, Bitton said.\n\n\"Social distancing is hard and may negatively impact many people, especially those who face vulnerabilities in our society,\" he wrote. But he continued: \"We have a preemptive opportunity to save lives through the actions we take right now that we will not have in a few weeks. It is a public health imperative ... We cannot wait.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been criticized for downplaying the severity of the coronavirus on multiple occasions, according to The New York Times.\n\nHe first commented on the illness on January 22 -- a day after the first US case was reported -- when CNBC's Joe Kernen asked the president if there were worries about a pandemic at that point.\n\nTrump replied: \"No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.\"\n\nHowever, development and distribution of coronavirus tests in the US have faced a series of errors and delays, triggering a test-kit shortage that prevented officials from gaining a clear understanding of exactly how many Americans have contracted the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rolled out a faulty test for COVID-19, then hit bottlenecks in distributing a better one for state and local labs to use, ProPublica reported.\n\nHowever, cities and states are now taking dramatic actions, including declaring public emergencies, closing tourist destinations, banning public gatherings, and shutting down schools.\n\nThe residents of six Bay Area counties have been asked to shelter in place, and the governor of Illinois has ordered all restaurants and bars to close through the end of March. Hoboken, New Jersey, will impose a curfew starting Monday, while New York City's comptroller is pushing for a citywide shutdown of non-essential businesses there.\n\nThese moves have short-term economic and social ramifications, but as Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget recently wrote, \"once we get a handle on the epidemic, the economy will recover.\"\n\nWhen Nguyen asked her source how long social distancing should remain the default, he said simply, \"Till it's over.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Source: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe fast-food industry has faced criticism for its lack of paid sick leave amid the coronavirus outbreak. Several restaurant chains and retailers have recently changed their sick-leave policies to allow for two weeks of paid leave for employees who are quarantined or have COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.\n\nMcDonald's adjusted its sick-leave policy to provide 14 days' protected leave for employees at company-owned restaurants following exposure to or a diagnosis of COVID-19. The company previously allowed and continues to allow employees at company-owned stores to earn up to five days of paid time off a year.\n\nA McDonald's representative told Business Insider that while sick-leave policies varied in accordance with local laws, restaurants worked to offer flexibility to employees. Further, the representative added, it is \"McDonald's expectation that crewmembers stay home when they are sick.\"\n\nAt 95% of McDonald's locations in the US, owner-operators have the freedom to determine their own sick-leave policies.\n\nCiting surveys from The Shift Project, a New York Times opinion article published on Saturday highlighted McDonald's as the employer in the retail, restaurant, and hospitality industries with the most workers who lack paid sick leave, with 517,000 employees.\n\n\"As the new coronavirus spreads across the United States, the time has come for restaurants, retailers and other industries that rely on low-wage labor to abandon their parsimonious resistance to paid sick leave,\" The Times' editorial board said. \"Companies that do not pay sick workers to stay home are endangering their workers, their customers and the health of the broader public.\"\n\nThe coronavirus relief bill originally required a permanent paid-sick-leave requirement. Republicans pushed back, and it was dropped.\n\nMcDonald's has asked franchisees to reach out to local representatives to express concerns about the bill's funding mechanism. The International Franchise Association has also pushed back on the bill.\n\n\"The construction of the paid leave mandate and refundable tax credit leaves small businesses with a significant and immediate cash flow crisis for the next six to eight critical weeks,\" Matt Haller, the IFA's senior vice president of government relations and public affairs, wrote in an open letter on Monday.\n\nAre you working at a chain restaurant during the coronavirus outbreak?

What \"SimCity\" was to building and running a city, \"The Sims\" is to human life.\n\nSince launching in 2014, \"The Sims 4\" has received a mess of add-ons, updates, and expansions that have added everything from pets to magic - many of which are also on sale.\n\nCheck out the most recent one right here:", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_gilbert@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ben Gilbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Sims 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Sims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SimCity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_simulation_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life simulation game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publisher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game publisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Simulation", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Art", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Art", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Human_Interaction", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Human Interaction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e71152fc48540481e4ea762?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5609663", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 28114}, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 28114, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1486004149", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-16", "time": "19:20:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-16T19:20:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-16T19:18:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-lockdown-coronavirus-disease-bay-area-2020-3", "title": "San Francisco Bay Area ordered to 'shelter in place' until April 7 as the city attempts to contain the coronavirus", "body": "The \"shelter in place\" order is different from a full lockdown, which would prohibit people from leaving their homes without government permission.\n\nThe Bay Area, including San Francisco, will be directed to \"shelter in place\" until April 7 in an attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the San Francisco Chronicle first reported on Monday.\n\nThe directive, which will go into effect at midnight on Tuesday, affects six Bay Area counties, including the county and city of San Francisco.\n\nAs the Chronicle noted, the affected population totals more than 6.7 million people.

Last year, for instance, the FBI zeroed in on conspiracy theories and identified them as a domestic terrorism threat.\n\n\"The FBI assesses anti-government, identity based, and fringe political conspiracy theories very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or in part, to commit criminal and sometimes violent activity,\" the document said. \"The FBI further assesses in some cases these conspiracy theories very likely encourage the targeting of specific people, places, and organizations, thereby increasing the likelihood of violence against these targets.\"\n\nThe vast majority of the conspiracy theories the FBI laid out in its threat assessment resulted in racially motivated violence by right-wing extremists.\n\nA number of those conspiracy theories - and the outlets that publish them - have even found their way into the White House and Trump's Twitter feed.\n\nThe president declared a national emergency over the coronavirus last week but has since been criticized for continuing to downplay the virus, falsely touting cures for the disease, and blaming the mainstream media and his perceived critics for hyping the crisis up.\n\nTrump also faced sharp backlash for describing the virus as the \"Chinese virus,\" which public health experts say is a racist and xenophobic term.\n\nCongress is currently working on passing a relief bill to help individuals and businesses hit hardest by the disease's spread.

were warning President Donald Trump about an impending pandemic as early as January, The Washington Post reported.\n\nOfficials were giving Trump classified briefings on the matter at the same time that the president was publicly downplaying the risk of the novel coronavirus and insisting the US was well prepared to handle the outbreak.\n\nThe Post reported that intelligence documents closely tracked the virus' spread in Wuhan, China, where it originated and as it later progressed through mainland China, but they did not specify when the disease would make it to the US.\n\n\"The system was blinking red,\" one US official with access to the intelligence told The Post. Agencies \"have been warning on this since January.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were -- they just couldn't get him to do anything about it,\" the official added.\n\nThe intelligence documents were disseminated to White House officials as well as congressional lawmakers and their staff. Congress also began receiving daily briefings on the virus earlier this year as it rapidly spread across the globe.\n\nBy the end of January and beginning of February, a majority of the intelligence contained in Trump's daily briefings was about the coronavirus, according to The Post.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11. To date, 271,629 people around the world have become infected and 11,282 have died.\n\nTrump declared a national emergency last week but has since been criticized for misrepresenting information about when a vaccine may become available, and blaming the mainstream media and his critics for the continued escalation of the crisis.\n\nIn the absence of strong federal guidance, various states and cities have had to take matters into their own hands and introduced sweeping measures to restrict public gatherings and stop the spread of the virus.\n\nThe governors of New York and California issued statewide orders mandating that residents stay inside as much as possible and limit their outdoor activity. Across the country, millions of people have been forced to work from home or lost their jobs altogether as nonessential businesses have been ordered to shut down.\n\nTrump on Friday evening approved a major disaster declaration for the state of New York, which has been the hardest hit by the disease's outbreak in the US.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sonam_sheth@businessinsider.com", "name": "Sonam Sheth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e75369e671de03c102cdd22?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5618030", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 15163, "pinterest": 7}, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 15170, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6001557437", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-20", "time": "18:43:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-20T18:43:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-20T18:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/dr-anthony-fauci-did-a-facepalm-during-trumps-coronavirus-briefing-2020-3", "title": "Dr. Anthony Fauci did a facepalm after Trump mentioned the 'Deep State Department' in a wild coronavirus briefing", "body": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been one of the most public facing health officials in the federal government when it comes to the coronavirus response. Normally stoic and even-keeled, Dr. Fauci briefly broke his poker face during Friday's press briefing. When President Donald Trump was on a tangent and joking about the State Department - calling it \"The Deep State Department,\" alluding to an unsubstantiated conspiracy against him by civil servants - Fauci covered his face. The moment did not go unnoticed on social media, with clips being shared on Twitter almost immediately afterwards.
