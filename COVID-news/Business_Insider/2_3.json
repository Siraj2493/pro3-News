A woman passed it to 5 relatives.", "body": "For the latest case total and death toll, see Business Insider's live updates here.\n\nChinese researchers have confirmed a case of asymptomatic transmission of the new coronavirus: A 20-year-old woman from Wuhan passed it to five of her family members but never got physically sick herself.\n\nThe case study is the first concrete evidence that a person showing no symptoms can pass the coronavirus to others -- a fact that could make curbing the outbreak even more challenging.\n\nThe researchers behind the finding said the 20-year-old woman was isolated and closely observed at the Fifth People's Hospital of Anyang. She never become physically ill, even after her family members developed fevers. Two of them got severe pneumonia.\n\nFor now, the woman's asymptomatic transmission appears to be an anomaly, but health experts have documented other instances in which people tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms.\n\nA report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed records of all of China's reported cases of the virus from December 8 to February 11 and found that 1.2% of patients confirmed to be infected showed no symptoms. A far higher portion of asymptomatic cases was found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where 322 of 621 people tested positive but showed no symptoms.\n\n\"It's very clear that the people who are getting caught in that umbrella of reporting are the people that present themselves to a hospital,\" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a briefing on February 6. \"There's another whole cohort that is either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old woman in the new case study lives in Wuhan -- the city where the outbreak started -- but traveled to Anyang on January 10. Three days later, she went with five family members to visit a sick patient (who did not have the coronavirus) at the Anyang District Hospital.\n\nOn January 17, one of the woman's family members came down with a fever and sore throat. The following week, the other four relatives developed a fever and respiratory symptoms. Those relatives were admitted to the Fifth People's Hospital on January 26.\n\nAll of the family members tested positive for the coronavirus. The only person they'd had contact with who had been in Wuhan was their 20-year-old relative.\n\nWhen doctors initially tested the young woman for the coronavirus, the results came back negative. Her CT scan was normal, too. But a day later, she tested positive for the virus even though she wasn't showing any symptoms. By February 11, the woman still had no fever, cough, sore throat, or gastrointestinal issues.\n\nDoctors concluded that the woman's incubation period -- the time during which she was infectious -- was 19 days. Chinese health officials previously estimated that the incubation period for the virus ranged from one to 14 days, but recent research suggests it could be as long as 24 days.\n\nThe US and many other countries have established quarantine rules for travelers from Wuhan based on that 14-day window.\n\nMost of the coronavirus cases so far have been mild, but the virus has killed more than 2,200 people and infected more than 76,000. Though the majority of cases are on the Chinese mainland, the virus has spread to 29 other countries.\n\nA case of asymptomatic transmission similar to the one described in the new case study was previously identified in Germany. But that research turned out to be flawed.\n\nAccording to a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a woman from Shanghai transmitted the virus to a 33-year-old German businessman in January. Three days later, he felt better and went back to work, then infected at least two of his colleagues. But the researchers had not spoken with the woman, who had in fact experienced mild symptoms at the time of transmission.\n\nThat left scientists unsure as to whether people who never experience any symptoms can transmit the disease -- until today.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aria_bendix@businessinsider.com", "name": "Aria Bendix", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transmission (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyang", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anyang"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anyang"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Princess_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diamond Princess (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

The young physician was admitted to the hospital after contracting the virus on January 25.\n\nAccording to a statement from the hospital obtained by the Guardian, Yinhua was sent to Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan for emergency treatment when his condition dramatically worsened. He died on Thursday night. Yinhua leaves behind his fianc\u00e9e, who has not been named.\n\nYinhua planned to marry his partner during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. They agreed to delay the ceremony so that Yinhua could help treat patients at the center of the outbreak. According to Xinhua, Yinhua never even had the chance to send out his wedding invitations, which still remain in his office drawer.\n\nIn the wake of his death, hundreds of Chinese citizens have taken to the social media platform Weibo to mourn his death, lauding the doctor as a \"hero.\"\n\n\"We will never forget these heroes,\" one Weibo user wrote in a post. \"They selflessly gave it all, I think we will always remember them.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ChinaDaily/status/1230771640772022272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nYinhua is one of at least eight medical professionals and one of the youngest to have died from the coronavirus, now known as COVID-19. It has primarily been fatal to older patients or those who had other ailments that compromised their immune systems.\n\nThe death of another doctor, named Li Wenliang, ignited widespread public outcry online. Wenliang was a whistleblower who attempted to raise alarm bells about the virus in the early days of the outbreak. Chinese citizens outraged by his death and the inconsistent reporting from state news media agencies demanded more free speech, but online watchdogs censored their cries.\n\nThe news of Yinhua's death comes as healthcare workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak are getting sick by the hundreds. China has reported that more than 1,700 health workers had contracted the new virus.\n\nConcerns about the condition of healthcare workers have escalated after a study published earlier this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that of 138 coronavirus patients studied at one hospital, 29% were healthcare workers.\n\nThe reports highlight yet another issue in the country's battle against the pandemic, as food and critical medical supplies are running low in the center of the outbreak. The novel coronavirus has swept across China, spreading to every province and region in the country and at least 29 other countries.\n\nOn Friday, the death toll of the coronavirus outbreak had risen to 2,250, with more than 76,000 people infected in 30 countries, inciting hysteria about the disease worldwide. But experts say the fatality rate of the novel virus is low, currently at about 2%.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

None of them tested positive for the virus.\n\n\"They have been watched more closely than anyone else in the United States at this point in time,\" Nancy Knight, director of the Division of Global Health Protection at the CDC, said in a briefing.\n\nIn total, the novel coronavirus outbreak has killed at least 2,100 people and infected more than 75,500, the vast majority of whom are in China. It has spread to 27 other countries, with 15 cases in the US.\n\nSo far, three US citizens evacuated from Wuhan tested positive for the novel coronavirus: two in California and one in Texas. They were all moved to local civilian hospitals, but probably won't be the US' last coronavirus patients, the CDC said.\n\n\"There will likely be additional cases in the coming days and weeks, including among other people recently returned from Wuhan,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nIn anticipation of additional cases, the US government set up quarantine centers at 15 military facilities across the country.\n\n\"Now is the time to act so that we can slow the introduction and impact of this virus in the US,\" Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said earlier this month.\n\nJamie Fouss, the US consul general in Wuhan, was among those quarantined in Riverside. He said evacuees tried to live normal lives during their two-week isolation -- they played trivia games, took Zumba and art classes, and sent their children to school.\n\nAbout 400 additional quarantined US citizens are still waiting for the all-clear to go home, though. At the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar last week, 322 people petitioned for more stringent virus testing after after one evacuee who'd tested positive for the coronavirus was accidentally sent back to the base from the UC San Diego Medical Center.\n\nMany of the petitioners completed their quarantines this week without any issues.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for carrying out federal quarantines -- the DOD is not involved in treating or observing the quarantined people.\n\nThe incubation period for the novel coronavirus -- the time between exposure and the onset of symptoms -- is believed to be between two and 14 days, according to the CDC.\n\nThe US and many other countries formulated their quarantine rules based on that 14-day maximum.\n\n\"It's widely accepted that there's a 14-day rule of thumb,\" Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, previously told Business Insider. \"That's how long you have to wait to go back to your daily life.\"\n\nHowever, recent research from a group of Chinese scientists suggested the virus' incubation period could be as long as 24 days. If true, that could suggest the current quarantine periods are not sufficient. But the study has yet to be peer reviewed.\n\n\"The incubation period is obviously really important for us as we look to make sure that we're releasing these people safely from quarantine,\" Messonnier said on February 12. But she added, \"We still think that for today, for now, 14 days is the right interval to use.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors":

That study has not yet been peer-reviewed, however.\n\nUncertainty about the incubation period, Meyers said, \"is particularly relevant when you're thinking about how long you actually have to monitor people to make sure that they're not infected.\"\n\nThe US and many other countries have formulated their quarantine policies based on a 14-day incubation period.\n\n\"It's widely accepted that there's a 14-day rule of thumb,\" Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, told Business Insider. \"That's how long you have to wait to go back to your daily life.\"\n\nThe UK, Australia, France, India, Italy, and Canada have also said that citizens repatriated from Wuhan will be quarantined for 14 days.\n\nAbout 800 US citizens evacuated from Wuhan have brought to military bases in nine states and put under a mandatory two-week quarantine. More than 200 of those evacuees were released this week, and another 195 left on February 10.\n\nBut if these new studies are correct, 14 days may not be sufficient.\n\nThe patient found to have a 19-day incubation period was a woman who lived in Wuhan but traveled to Anyang on January 10. There, she interacted with five family members; by January 26, all five tested positive for the coronavirus. The Wuhan woman had passed it to them without showing any symptoms, researchers determined.. She positive for the virus herself on January 28, but she never showed any symptoms at all.\n\nThe study published earlier in February found that the median incubation period for all 1,099 cases examined was three days, though the full range of incubation periods ranged from zero to 24 days.\n\nStill, CDC officials have said they're confident that the US evacuees' two-week isolation is long enough.\n\n\"The incubation period is obviously really important for us as we look to make sure that we're releasing these people safely from quarantine,\" Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on February 12.\n\n\"We still think that for today, for now, 14 days is the right interval to use,\" she added.\n\nMichael Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization's health-emergencies program, said last week that the WHO was also \"not considering changing anything\" about its quarantine recommendations.\n\nIdentifying a virus' incubation period is critical for modeling its spread.\n\n\"It gives you an idea of how quickly the virus could propagate, if you want to project how many patients you're going to see,\" Morse said.\n\nMorse added that there were a few reasons to be skeptical of the 24-day estimate: \"Was this one patient or a significant number that experienced a 24-day incubation period?\" he said.\n\nThat study didn't specify how many patients had incubation periods longer than two weeks.\n\nWhat's more, Morse said, the 24-day figure could have been based on inexact data.\n\n\"These are largely patients who have been found through hospitalization,\" he said. \"So we don't know how long they've had the virus based on when they went to hospital. We have to rely on their memory of when they were exposed, which may or may not be accurate.\"\n\nMorse also questioned the lower end of the incubation-period range in that study.\n\n\"Zero days makes me suspect -- does that mean patients are developing symptoms the same day as contact?\" he said. \"One to two days I can accept, but less than 24 hours seems extreme.\"\n\nRyan offered another possible explanation for longer-than-expected incubation periods: \"A very long incubation period can reflect a double exposure,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType":

Liu Zhiming's death is part of the growing number of infections among Chinese healthcare workers, who have been working in dire conditions to fight the outbreak. A total of seven nurses and doctors have now died, and over 1,700 have been infected by the virus Public-health experts told Business Insider they are not surprised by the increase in the number of infected workers, and blamed the government's slow initial reaction and a lack of medical supplies. Therese Hesketh, an expert on Chinese public health at University College London, says there is a high chance more workers will become infected in the coming weeks. This could slow down the country's fight against the virus, she said. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nOne of Wuhan's most senior doctors died Tuesday after contracting the deadly novel coronavirus, adding to the number of healthcare workers who have fallen victim to the disease, and raising questions on China's ability to contain the outbreak.\n\nLiu Zhiming, director of Wuhan's Wuchang Hospital, died at 10:54 a.m. local time after an \"all-out rescue effort\" failed to save him, according to an official statement by the Wuhan municipal health commission. He was 51.\n\nThe hospital is one of the main healthcare facilities in Wuhan treating patients with the virus, which is believed to have originated in a wet market in the city last December.\n\nThe virus, otherwise known as COVID-19, has since spread to 26 other countries, infecting more than 71,000 people around the world and killing at least 1,873. Most of the deaths have taken place in China.\n\nMedical staff in China have been feeling the toll of treating patients with coronavirus, with reports that over 1,700 have so far been infected. Including Liu, a total of seven healthcare workers who have contracted the disease have now died.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider 5 redenen om voor de 1 jaar oude Galaxy S10 van Samsung te gaan in plaats van de gloednieuwe Galaxy S20 Foto: Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, which city authorities built in days to tend to coronavirus patients.sourceGetty Experts say growing infections aren't a surprise\n\nPublic-health experts say the increase in the number of infections among medical workers is no surprise, and warned that this could hamper China's efforts to contain the outbreak.\n\n\"When you've got a massive epidemic like this, its very difficult to control it. Especially when health workers are having to care for people with a very contagious virus on a daily basis,\" Therese Hesketh, an expert on Chinese public health at University College London, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Because we still don't really know enough about the exact mechanisms of transmission, there may also be ways that it's being transmitted that we still don't know about,\" added Hesketh.\n\nThe lack of proper medical equipment, facilities, and protective gear for medical staff could also be a reason for the rise in infections among the medical personnel.\n\nProfessor David Heymann, who led the World Health Organization's infectious diseases unit during the 2003 SARS outbreak, told Business Insider: \"There have been many health workers infected and presumably, some of them are not using some of the proper infection, prevention and control measures.\"\n\n\"Especially at the start of an infection, when the outbreak is beginning, people might not recognize how contagious this disease can be, and the necessary measures might not be taken fast enough,\" he added.\n\nFoto: A doctor being disinfected by his colleague at a quarantine zone in Wuhan on January 3 2020.sourceSTR/AFP via Getty Images This could hamper the country's fight against coronavirus\n\nMore than 1,700 healthcare workers in Wuhan have contracted the coronavirus since its outbreak two months ago, Business Insider's Holly Secon reported. Research published earlier this month by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that almost a third of the 138 coronavirus patients studied were healthcare workers.\n\nThe number of infected doctors and nurses could continue to rise in the coming weeks, Hesketh warned.\n\n\"There will absolutely be a rise in infected medical workers,\" she said. \"How many of them end up being seriously ill and dying is another question.\"\n\n\"It will presumably also slow down the fight in trying to contain the virus,\" Hesketh said.\n\nThe Chinese State Council's disease prevention and control units announced on Monday that they had sent more than 30,000 medical staff from across the country into Wuhan to help the overwhelmed city.\n\nThe WHO has also highlighted the need to prevent medics from getting infected.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week: \"Health workers are the glue that holds the health system and outbreak response together. We need to know more about how they are getting sick.\"\n\nFoto: A makeshift hospital at an exhibition center in Wuhan on February 5, 2020.sourceFeature China/Barcroft Media via Getty Images The initial reaction of the government put medical workers at risk\n\nThe rise in infections among workers can also be attributed to how the country initially dealt with trying to contain the virus.\n\nHesketh, who worked in China for nearly ten years, said: \"There was a huge crush on facilities as soon as the outbreak occurred. Thousands of people turning up at these acute hospitals, spreading the virus amongst each other, with little organization in those early days.\"\n\nMedics in Wuhan have in the past few weeks reported dire conditions with accounts of overcrowded hospitals, a shortage in protective gear, and even a shortage of food and drink, according to Business Insider's Lauren Frias.\n\nHesketh added that the country needs to do more to protect its healthcare workers.\n\n\"You currently have huge problems with large numbers of people that are being quarantined in health facilities unnecessarily,\" she said.\n\nChinese health authorities recent implemented new house-to-house checks designed to seek out and \"round up\" all infected patients, The Guardian reported, citing Chinese state media.\n\nAs a result, ten quarantine centers have been set up to provide an additional 11,4000 beds for people showing only mild symptoms of infection, the newspaper reported.\n\nFoto: Medical staff set up beds as they prepare to accept patients displaying mild symptoms of novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan on February 5, 2020.sourceSTR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHesketh thinks this only serves to slow down productivity.\n\n\"They should actually just be sent home if their symptoms are mild,\" she said. \"They've got all the personnel there [in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located] to enforce home quarantine, which would actually really take the pressure of the health workers as well.\"\n\nBut the professor remains positive. \"On a lighter note, you have to hand it to the Chinese for what they're doing so far. I have a colleague who has gone to volunteer in China because he believes it is his duty and wants to help as many people as possible.\"\n\n\"Public health is sometimes about some people making sacrifices for the good of the many. And the Chinese being Chinese, and being very autocratic, can actually do that in a way that no other country can.\"\n\nRead more: The Wuhan coronavirus has killed more people in 6 weeks than SARS did in 8 months.

dog.\n\nAnimals are the latest victims of the coronavirus crisis in mainland China.\n\nAmid a scramble to control the spread of COVID-19, Chinese authorities believe, based on samples and tests, that at least 135 wild animals were poisoned by disinfectants being used to curb the illness, United Press International said based on reports from China's state-owned news agency Xinhua.\n\nThe mass die-off was reported in the megacity of Chongqing, in southwest China, which, in 2016, was home to over 30 million people. At least 17 species of animals, including wild boar, weasels, and blackbirds, have been affected, according to the Chongqing Forestry Bureau.\n\nTests have shown that the animals didn't die of any diseases such as coronavirus or bird flu, UPI said. They will be buried in disinfected sites.\n\nChinese state media said Chongqing is rounding up an estimated 5,300 forest rangers to monitor wildlife in the area. They will be accompanied by 200 \"full-time supervisors,\" Xinhua reported, although it's unclear what they will be doing.\n\nThis may have been an unintended consequence of an official policy but animal rights activists with the Nanchong Stray Animal Rescue claim that authorities are killing domesticated animals outright amid fears that they can spread the coronavirus.\n\nOfficers in the Sichuan Province are allegedly knocking on people's doors and ordering residents to hand over their pets, while people beg for their companions to be spared, Metro UK reported. The group has accused Chinese authorities of killing the animals within minutes of getting their hands on them.\n\nAn activist shared several distressing images on Weibo: bloodied animals in a truck, a person hitting a dog with a wooden stick and an officer prodding a dog that was lying dead on the side of the road while people looked on.\n\nLocal officials have denied the accusations, saying animals were only killed if they had bitten anyone.\n\nMetro UK also reported that residents of Hubei province - where the COVID-19 outbreak originated - were ordered to \"deal with\" their pets within five days. Animals weren't allowed outside people's homes and would be caught and killed, if they were found. These measures were also enforced in Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Hebei, and Shanghai.\n\nLi Lanjuan, a professor and member of China's National Health Commission, sparked these steps by warning people to quarantine pets if they had come in contact with someone infected with COVID-19, according to reports.\n\nCoronavirus has affected 75,465 people and killed 2,236 as of Friday, according to the National Health Commission. China plans to ban its wild animal trade and tighten supervision on \"wet markets,\" which is where the coronavirus was reported to have started, although subsequent research cast doubt over that

"A day-by-day breakdown of coronavirus symptoms shows how the disease, COVID-19, goes from bad to worse", "body": "Chinese health officials report that the majority of cases of the new coronavirus are mild, but around 20% of patients have either severe cases of disease or become critically ill. A fever is the most common symptom. Here's how the symptoms progress day by day among typical patients. For the latest case total and death toll, see Business Insider's live updates here. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nIt starts with a fever. That's the most common symptom among patients who get the new coronavirus that has swept across China.\n\nA recent study of nearly 140 patients at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University identified a typical pattern of symptoms associated with the virus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19. Around 99% of the patients developed a high temperature, while more than half experienced fatigue and a dry cough. About a third also experienced muscle pain and difficulty breathing.\n\nResearch from the Chinese Center for Disease Control suggests that around 80% of coronavirus cases are mild. Around 15% of patients have gotten severe cases, and 5% have become critically ill.\n\nHere's how symptoms progress among typical patients:\n\nDay 1: Patients run a fever. They may also experience fatigue, muscle pain, and a dry cough. A small minority of them may have had diarrhea or nausea one to two days before. Day 5: Patients may have difficulty breathing - especially if they are older or have a preexisting health condition. Day 7: This is how long it takes, on average, before patients are admitted to a hospital, according to the Wuhan University study. Day 8: At this point, patients with severe cases (15%, according to the Chinese CDC) develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an illness that occurs when fluid builds up the lungs. ARDS is often fatal. Day 10: If patients have worsening symptoms, this is the time in the disease's progression when they're most likely to be admitted to the ICU. These patients probably have more abdominal pain and appetite loss than patients with milder cases. Only a small fraction die: The current fatality rate hovers around 2%. Day 17: On average, people who recover from the virus are discharged from the hospital after two-and-a-half weeks.\n\nHowever, the first symptoms might not come right after a person has been infected. Lauren Ancel Meyers, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin, told Business Insider that a typical patient may be infected without showing symptoms for five or more days.\n\nOnce symptoms do appear, they can be similar to pneumonia. But Paras Lakhani, a radiologist at Thomas Jefferson University, told Business Insider that the way COVID-19 can worsen over time distinguishes it from pneumonia.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Private lease van een elektrische fiets: dit ben je per maand kwijt aan een e-bike\n\n\"Pneumonia usually doesn't rapidly progress,\" Lakhani said. \"Typically, most hospitals will treat with antibiotics and patients will stabilize and then start to get better.\"\n\nCoronavirus patients, however, can get worse even after they receive treatment such as fluids or steroids. One case study found that three days after a 33-year-old woman started receiving treatment at a hospital in Lanzhou, her case was more pronounced than when she arrived.\n\nIn total, the new coronavirus has killed more than 2,200 people and infected more than 76,000. It originated in Wuhan, central China's most populous city, and has since spread to 29 other countries. The majority of cases are still located on the Chinese mainland.\n\nRead more about the coronavirus:\n\nChinese scientists say coronavirus illness symptoms peaked on February 1 - but they warn that the epidemic could 'rebound' China is diagnosing coronavirus patients by looking for 'ground glass' in their lungs.

with experts predicting it will wipe out more than $10 billion in spending from Chinese visitors", "body": "If the coronavirus continues to spread, particularly in other countries, the impact could be significantly worse.\n\nWhile the vast majority of coronavirus cases have been found in China and Asia, the US travel industry is also steeling itself to be ravaged by the rogue virus.\n\nA new report from consulting firm Tourism Economics has put some estimated numbers to that ravaging, saying it expects the US to lose about 1.6 million visitors from mainland China as a result of the coronavirus, translating to a 28% drop for 2020. The report tallied expected losses from Chinese visitor spending at $10.3 billion -- more than half of which are expected occur this year.\n\nTravel and spending from Chinese visitors in America is massive, with China being the third-largest source of overseas travel to the United States behind the UK and Japan, according to the US Travel Association, an industry-advocacy organization. Each Chinese visitor to the US spent an average of $6,500 in 2018, according to the latest data available, which a spokesperson for US Travel characterized as \"among the highest of all international visitors.\"\n\nIn 2018, Chinese travelers spent a total of $34.6 billion to the US economy, including $17 billion in travel-specific spending. Visitors spent an average of 12 nights in the country, and the majority were in the US for vacation or visits to friends and family.\n\nThis trend appeared to continue in 2019, with data from the National Travel and Tourism Office showing 2.5 million Chinese visitors in the first the first 10 months of the year -- accounting for roughly 7% of all overseas visits.\n\nAnalysts looking at the possible industry impact of the coronavirus have referred back to the 2003 SARS outbreak and 2015 MERS episode. However, the scale and spread of the Wuhan coronavirus have both dwarfed SARS, suggesting that the impact could be longer lasting and more severe.\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak, the US experienced a 30% decrease in visitors from China, and a 10% fall in travelers from the rest of Asia, according to the Tourism Economics report. It took three years for the market to fully recover.\n\nThe impact is expected to be worse than during SARS because there are more Chinese travelers than in there were in 2003 -- according to the Tourism Economics report, visits from China to the US have grown 1,270% since 2002. Then, the Chinese market only represented 1% of all overseas visitors to the US and 3% of visitor spending, compared to 7% of visitors and 16% of spending in 2019.\n\n\"Given the massive increase in the Chinese travel market, the impact in absolute terms will be much larger than from the SARS crisis,\" the report said.\n\nWhile visits impacted by the current coronavirus are expected to ramp back up in 2021, the report projects that it will take about four years to fully recover. An expected 4.6 million hotel room nights will be lost this year -- 8.1 million total through 2024 -- the report said, with states and cities around the country feeling the impact.\n\nNotably, the projections do not include possible losses from other markets in Asia. If the virus continues to spread outside of China, the impact could be significantly worse.\n\nThe total impact could be enough to affect the nation's gross domestic product: The travel and tourism industries represented 2.8% of the GDP in 2017, according to the Department of Commerce. UBS economists warned that the virus' effect on the world economy is driving growth near negative levels for the first quarter of 2020.\n\nUS airlines have largely tried to contain the damage by preemptively suspending routes to China and reconfiguring capacity to Asia. However, this capacity decrease will still lead to decreased revenue, and the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization forecasted that the global airline industry's revenue could take a $5 billion hit in just the first quarter. Airlines from China and Hong Kong are expected to fare worst.\n\nAccording to a report from Hopper, the travel booking app, demand for travel from the US to China dropped more than 58% compared to 2019 at its lowest point so far this year. The good news for US airlines is that overall travel demand among Americans continues to grow, although there's a shift toward interest in domestic travel over international destinations.\n\nThe economic pain of the coronavirus is expected to reverberate through the entire travel industry, as shown by the Tourism Economics report. The ban on foreign citizens who have been in China within the previous two weeks, combined with plummeting demand for business travel to and from the region, presents an impending disaster for industries that rely on airlines, hotels, museums, conference organizers, and other types of companies in the US that rely on travel from the region.\n\nThe coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, and was first identified and reported in late 2019, has infected more than 73,000 people and killed at least 1,875 around the world. Cases have been found in at least 26 other countries.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

'super-spreader' event occurred at a church 'cult'", "body": "Calling this an \"unprecedented crisis,\" Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin has urged churchgoers to stay indoors, while shutting down kindergartens, malls, restaurants, and other public spaces.\n\nA South Korean city has gone on the offensive after two clusters of coronavirus cases, which have been traced to doomsday cult church and a hospital nearly tripled the number of patients in the country.\n\nThe Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Thursday that 53 additional patients have tested positive for COVID-19. The day before, 20 new cases had been reported. There are now 104 coronavirus patients and one fatality in South Korea.\n\nThis uptick mostly comes from 43 members of the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, a fringe religious faction in the city of Daegu, and 15 people at a hospital in Cheongdo County. The country's first coronavirus death also occurred at this hospital, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe church at the center of this outbreak is part of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which was established in 1984 by Lee Man-hee and counts about 200,000 South Koreans among its ranks. Lee claims to have taken on the mantle of Jesus Christ and purports to have the ability to save 144,000 people on Judgment Day by taking them to heaven with him, the Guardian said.\n\n\"Most believers accept this large cluster of cases occurring at the church as a test of their belief,\" Park Hyung-tak, who leads the Korea Christian Heresy Research Institute, told the South China Morning Post about the group that views itself as \"chosen\" and \"favored by God.\"\n\nA 61-year-old churchgoer was diagnosed with the coronavirus on Tuesday, prompting health officials to ask the church's thousand other followers to put themselves in quarantine. So far, South Koreans who tested positive for the illness had either traveled to mainland China or been in contact with someone who had. It remains unknown how the woman, who has been dubbed Patient 31, contracted COVID-19, Reuters reported.\n\nHowever, since the number of coronavirus patients has jumped since she became ill, with many coming from the \"same Korean cult,\" this is being considered as a \"super-spreader\" event, the KCDC said to the South China Morning Post in a press release.\n\nFollowers have been asked \"to stay at home isolated from their families,\" Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin said, while Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the KCDC, urged people who visited both the church and the hospital report any symptoms to officials.\n\nThe church has shut its facilities across South Korea and encouraged churchgoers to partake in online prayer sessions in response to the outbreak, the South China Morning Post said.\n\nIt also released a statement on Thursday, decrying the barrage of criticism and defended itself against being cast as \"the main culprit of coronavirus transmissions,\" blaming those who have deemed it a \"cult\" for the wrongful accusations, the Washington Post said.\n\nPastor Shin Hyun-uk, an anti-Temple campaigner, is not mollified. He is worried that more cases may be linked to the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, because of its so-called \"study rooms\" where believers are taught the church's evangelical ways.\n\n\"Their so-called 'harvesters' go to other Christian churches, take part in prayer sessions there and engage in other activities in order to woo away ordinary believers,\" he told the South China Morning Post. \"I doubt whether the church would come clean about the movements of its believers who were with the 31st patient and cooperate with authorities in tracing contacts for fear that it would reveal their secret evangelistic activities. This is really a worrisome situation.\"\n\nThe South Korean newspaper NoCut News was able to interview a church believer, who shared that Patient 31 was in close proximity with other churchgoers during prayer services on February 9 and 16, both of which are being investigated by authorities.\n\nThere is an 8-story Daegu building that houses the temple. In it, married women convene on the fourth floor, married men on the seventh, and unwed men and women gather on the eighth floor, the unnamed source told NoCut News, which was reported by the South China Morning Post.\n\nAt these prayers sessions, churchgoers sit close enough to each other that they can \"rub their shoulders,\" while praising God \"at the top of their [voices] for about 30 minutes, and listening to sermons for another hour. Afterward, people converse in small groups while married women organize potluck parties.\n\nPeople who donned face masks as a precaution against the coronavirus \"were told to remove [them] while attending prayer sessions,\" the follower told NoCut News.\n\nTemple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony said in its statement to the South China Morning Post that its leaders have been urging believers since the end of January to stay home if they had traveled internationally or were feeling unwell. The KCDC is looking into a possible connection between the church and the hospital because officials say the 31st patient went to the hospital in early February.\n\nA 63-year-old man, who had been bedridden at the Cheongdo hospital for over two decades, died of coronavirus, Yonhap said. But people in a locked psychiatric ward have also contracted COVID-19, the South China Morning Post said, prompting all the hospital's patients and staff members to undergo testing.\n\nDaegu residents have been asked to stay home as officials brace for more cases, Kwon said, stressing, \"We are in an unprecedented crisis.\"\n\nSouth Korea's Vice Health Minister Kim Kang-lip echoed the sentiment, saying \"local transmission of the coronavirus\" is already underway in multiple parts of the country, creating a \"very grave\" situation, Reuters reported.\n\nTo try and control the spread of the coronavirus, extreme precautionary measures are being enforced at Kwon's orders. Streets in the usually busy city, which has an estimated population of 2.5 million people, have lost their hustle and bustle as kindergartens and public libraries have been closed, and shopping malls, restaurants, and movie theaters lie deserted, Yonhap reported.\n\nSchools have taken the unprecedented step of delaying the start of their spring semester, which usually kicks off in March. And a concert in which BTS and other K-pop stars were expected to perform at Daegu Stadium has been postponed from March 8, but it's unclear when the show will be rescheduled.\n\nSouth Korea's Defence Ministry has forbidden troops stationed in Daegu from welcoming guests and leaving their barracks. Similar restrictions are in place at a US military base in the city.\n\n\"Daegu lockdown\" and \"Daegu church\" were among the top searches on Naver, a popular South Korean internet portal, with people discussing whether the city should be placed on lockdown and shut off from the rest of the country -- similar to what Chinese officials did with Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. A KCDC official told Reuters that such a measure is not yet on the table.\n\nBut people took to social media to document the deserted city.\n\n\"It's like someone dropped a bomb in the middle of the city. It looks like a zombie apocalypse,\" Kim Geun-woo told Reuters. \"Even Dongseong-ro Street - the most crowded centre of the city - is empty.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType":

A day later, his partner tested positive, the Japan Times reported.\n\nThe man began displaying signs of the coronavirus while traveling in Oahu from February 3 to February 6. According to the CDC, individuals can display symptoms of COVID-19 between two and 14 days after exposure, which means the man could have contracted the virus before arriving in Hawaii. It is unclear when the woman began displaying signs of illness.\n\nDelta is contacting all the passengers on the couple's flight 611, a 10-hour journey from Honolulu to Nagoya, Japan. The airliner departed in the afternoon on February 6, landing in Nagoya on the evening of February 7 after crossing the International Date Line.\n\n\"The health and safety of our customers and crews is our top priority,\" a Delta spokeswoman told Business Insider. \"In cooperation with Japanese health officials, we are proactively reaching out to customers who were onboard that flight as well as taking the necessary steps to ensure the safety of our customers and crew.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the spokeswoman said she didn't have an update and wouldn't clarify when the company started notifying passengers.\n\nThe man and woman, both in their 60s, were in Maui from January 28 to February 3, and then Oahu until their February 6 flight home. Authorities are investigating whether the couple had close interaction with anyone during their visit.\n\nSo far they have found one individual who spent time with the couple, according to Lieutenant Governor Josh Green.\n\nThat man \"is in two weeks of home isolation now,\" Green told KHON, a CNN local news affiliate.\n\nAuthorities only know details of when and where the man contracted the virus. For now, there is no information on when and where the woman became ill, according to CNN.\n\nThe man had no symptoms while visiting Maui, and then developed cold-like symptoms on Oahu but had no fever. During the latter half of their trip, the couple stayed at a timeshare at the Grand Waikikian by Hilton Grand Vacations in Honolulu.\n\n\"It's very likely the [man] was exposed in Japan [before he traveled to Hawaii] or in transit coming to Hawaii, and became sick when he was here,\" Hawaii Department of Health Director Bruce Anderson said at a press conference on Friday.\n\nAccording to state epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park, the man did not seek medical attention until getting to Japan, where his symptoms worsened, CNN reported. \"Our focus is about his whereabouts while he was on Oahu, because that's when he developed symptoms,\" she said at the press conference.\n\nAs they flew to Japan, the man wore a mask, and he may have also worn one on other parts of the trip.", "source":

of the Diamond Princess cruise ship started with 10 coronavirus cases and ended with more than 630", "body": "For the latest case total, death toll, and travel information, see Business Insider's live updates here.\n\nPassengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship got their first piece of bad news on February 4: Ten people onboard had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.\n\nIt was the beginning of a two-week ordeal of quarantine orders and disease response that has been widely criticized as a failure. On Friday, Japan's Ministry of Health reported that 634 people from the ship had tested positive for the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an additional 18 cases from the ship, with an expectation that more will arise.\n\nTwo people have died.\n\n\"The quarantine was not justified, and violated the individual rights of the passengers while allowing the virus to literally pick them off one-by-one,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, who works at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nAdalja and other experts have criticized the decision to keep passengers and crew on the ship and said poor hygiene practices helped spread the virus.\n\n\"I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told USA Today. \"People were getting infected on that ship. Something went awry.\"\n\nThe man, from Hong Kong, boarded the ship in Japan and stayed on board for five days, then disembarked in his hometown.\n\nWhen it docked in Yokohama, the ship had 3,711 crew members and guests.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, it took Japanese officials more than 72 hours to lock down the ship after they were notified about the Hong Kong man's case.\n\nPassengers had already been on the ship for two weeks, since the quarantine came at the end of their scheduled cruise.\n\nSpencer Fehrenbacher, an American grad student on the ship, told Business Insider that he experienced a \"wall for information\" about test results. He said on February 6 that he'd been waiting to get his own results for two days.\n\nOther passengers reported long delays in getting tested at all, even after they reported symptoms.\n\n\"There wasn't much information,\" passenger Masako Ishida told The New York Times on February 5. She said many passengers did not immediately understand that they may have been exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nPassengers tallied the ambulances lined up on the pier, The New York Times reported, in order to get a sense of how many infections been confirmed on the ship.\n\n\"You could hear that cough that's deep down in your lungs. I empathized with her and felt so bad,\" Fehrenbacher said. But he also recalled thinking to himself, \"Okay, I don't want to be in this room.\"\n\nShe said her husband's first temperature measurement was about 90 degrees Fahrenheit, well below normal body temperature. When she asked for a second measurement, it was 95 degrees.\n\nIshida added that meals had been chaotic in the first days as well, with breakfast arriving at 2 p.m., quickly followed by lunch.\n\nOn February 11, a crew member told passengers that as many as 1,850 people on board (who had not been expecting to be stuck there for so long) had requested and been given more prescription medications.\n\n\"We're basically being treated like we're prisoners and criminals at the moment; that's how we feel,\" Alan Steele said. He added that lunch on the first day had been stale bread with ham.\n\nThe next day, the ship's operator, Princess Cruises, said that it had \"activated new in-room entertainment offerings,\" including games, trivia, arts and crafts, movies, eight new TV channels, and newspapers printed in 36 languages.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/shannonvo/status/1226679610957385728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mjswhitebread/status/1226772851400695808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nThe masks are not great at preventing wearers from contracting the novel coronavirus, but they may help keep sick people's germs from passing to others.\n\nOfficials advised passengers to keep 6 feet apart.\n\n\"From a virologist's perspective, a cruise ship with a large number of persons on board is more an incubator for viruses rather than a good place for quarantine,\" Dr. Anne Gatignol, a microbiologist who studies viruses at McGill University, told the Montreal Gazette.\n\n\"They've basically trapped a bunch of people in a large container with [the] virus,\" David Fisman, an epidemiology professor at University of Toronto, told Vox. \"So [I'm] assuming 'quarantine' is generating active transmission.\"\n\n\"Lots of chrome and polished metal, things with grooves and nicks and scratches. It just makes a good home,\" she said.\n\n\"The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of the infection control,\" Iwata said in a Youtube video. \"There was no distinction between the green zone, which is free of infection, and the red zone, which is potentially contaminated by the virus.\"\n\nThe group shared a series of videos on Facebook. One of them, Binay Kumar Sarkar, told Business Insider that the situation on the ship was \"out of control.\"\n\n\"There are lot of people who don't have coronavirus so why are we all being confined here?\" he said. \"Please save at least those of us who are healthy.\"\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, infected crew members had eaten in the mess hall alongside their coworkers.\n\nThe New York Times reported that 85 crew members tested positive for the virus.\n\n\"There are many places where we all are together, not separated from each other,\" Thakkar told CNN. \"Especially when we sit in the same mess hall and eat together, the place where it can spread very fast.\"\n\n\"I can't wrap my head around the fact that I could die from this cruise,\" Gay Courter, a 75-year-old novelist confined to a cabin on the ship with her husband, told The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"The whole idea of the cruise ship quarantine was ill-conceived, and the resultant slew of infections it spawned was completely predictable,\" he added.\n\nThe offer applied to passengers over 80 who had windowless cabin rooms or pre-existing medical conditions. They had to test negative for the virus before they could leave the ship.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/maejuliene18/status/1228238602338852864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nCrew members danced below deck and children drew pictures. The first group of healthy people was also allowed to leave the ship that day: 11 passengers older than 80.\n\nOfficials in Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, and the US are requiring their residents to undergo an additional 14-day quarantine once they return.\n\nMore than half of the infected people (322) showed no symptoms at all, which suggests that some coronavirus carriers in China could be going undetected.\n\nResearchers still aren't sure to what extent people can spread the virus when they have no symptoms, though a report published Friday documented a case in which a woman who was asymptomatic passed the coronavirus to five family members.\n\nTheir tests came back positive after they had left the ship and were traveling to their plane home, the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services said in a joint statement on Monday.\n\nThe agencies also said the passengers had been evaluated, and \"all were deemed asymptomatic and fit to fly before being processed for evacuation.\"\n\nThose people had sat in the two evacuation planes' main cabins.\n\nThe CDC reported on Friday that a total of 18 people had tested positive, though that number could grow.\n\n\"We do think based on epidemiology and risk assessment that there may be additional cases,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's respiratory diseases center, said in a press conference on Friday.\n\n\"We don't want to take [the tests done in Japan] at face value,\" CDC spokesperson Scott Pauley told The San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that CDC officials lost the argument on the tarmac, then insisted they be left out of the news release announcing that 14 infected Americans had shared a plane with more than 300 others.\n\nThe passengers were taken to local hospitals on February 11 and 12, and both had underlying health issues, The New York Times reported, citing the Japanese broadcaster NHK.\n\n\"The expectation is that the ship would be fully sanitized and then taken into dry dock for a period of time,\" Negin Kamali, public-relations director for Princess Cruises, told The Wall Street Journal.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_mcfall_johnsen@businessinsider.com", "name": "Morgan McFall-Johnsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Princess_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diamond Princess (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Center_for_Health_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_and_group_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Individual and group rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Hundreds of armed police intervened to push back the protesters, and the buses were eventually able to pass and reach the quarantine.\n\nSome of those onboard the buses waved Ukrainian flags in an attempt to plead for solidarity, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP.)\n\nAs they clashed with police, protesters chanted \"shame on you\" at the officers trying to prevent their attack.\n\nUkraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, pleaded for the protesters to show empathy.

"Wall Street has a new slogan for why stocks keep going up as the world falls apart: 'Nothing Matters'", "body": "This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.\n\nFor the last few weeks one phrase has encapsulated the energy on Wall Street. It's very simple: \"Nothing matters.\"\n\nThe phrase has become a catchall for a host of oddities that are making investors distrust the market. In this market investment grade (or, quality) credit yields about the same as junk. In this market huge geopolitical events are shrugged off as a mere blip. In this market the answer to any question is \"buy stocks.\"\n\nThis may sound like a welcome simplification, but what it is is a suspension of reality. This is not how the world should work.\n\nIf \"buy stocks\" is the answer to every question in investing, then the entire game of Wall Street doesn't matter. There's no point figuring out what something is worth. Value has no meaning when everything is the same. Good is just as good as bad, because bad is probably fine.\n\nIn truth the market has been nihilistic like this for some time. But that it's persisting in this way despite the fact that a virus has brought the second-largest economy in the world to a standstill for almost a month is -- frankly -- starting to freak people out.\n\nGuggenheim Investments CIO Scott Minerd likened this creepiness in the face of coronavirus to the calm that settled in Britain just before WWII, when Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain convinced himself and his peers that the world was entering a \"peace for our time,\" and told everyone to ignore the red flags all around them.\n\n\"For those investors who perceive the disconnect between risk assets which are priced for a rosy outcome and the reality of the looming risks to growth and earnings, any attempt to reduce risk leads to underperformance,\" Minerd wrote. \"It is a mind-numbing exercise for investors who see the cognitive dissonance. The frantic race to accumulate securities has cast price discovery to the side.\"\n\nUnfortunately that means Wall Street is crowding now, which creates a dangerous situation in the event that there is a rush to the exits.\n\nWall Street will play this game until it's over. Standing up for value might be the right thing if you're a moralist, but it won't win you clients. Ultimately that means everyone in this market is chasing the same ok-yielding credit and blue chip or growth stocks. That's what happens when no one trusts the market.\n\nThe question is why this inertia taken over. I tend to think of it as lagging the inertia in our political system, combined with a lack of trust.\n\nLast week Apple warned that coronavirus would take a chunk out of its earnings. The market dipped, but shrugged it off. At investment bank after investment bank the house view is that China will have coronavirus contained in short order.\n\n\"Our base case remains that the virus can be largely controlled by the end of March, and that the negative impact on\n\nthe Chinese economy will be mostly confined to the first quarter, with a pent-up demand-driven rebound in 2Q onwards,\" analysts at UBS wrote last week.\n\nNever mind that fewer than a third of China's 300 million migrant workers have returned to work, or that Chinese companies are warning that they won't make payroll, or that the entire global shipping trade has been disrupted as containers sit immobile. Never mind that the Chinese banking system is still recovering from a mini-meltdown last June.\n\nIt doesn't matter, everyone on Wall Street says, China will bounce back by the end of the first quarter and stocks will keep going up.\n\nBut how stocks keep going up is telling us something now too.\n\nOver at The Street, Helene Meisler noted that, for the most part, stocks peaked around mid-January. Only the big cap indexes, the biggest safest stocks in the world, are moving.\n\nAsk just about anyone in the markets what is to blame for this weird environment and they'll tell you it's the fact that interest rates haven't gone up meaningfully since the financial crisis. It's a good answer, but it's not the whole answer.\n\nRates haven't gone up because, while the economy is good by most widely-used measures, there seems to be a persistent lack of financial stability for many Americans.\n\nOver at The Atlantic, Annie Lowery is calling it The Great Affordability Crisis. Sen. Elizabeth Warren talks about it on the campaign trail. Deloitte cited it as a reason why millennials have been slow to start their own families. While the Trump administration celebrates every monthly nudge of wage growth, it's important to remember that only 10 of the last 40 years saw consistent wage gains for workers.\n\nAmerican families are using a variety of things to make up for this shortfall of income, including credit. Average Americans are increasingly going into debt just to live their lives. These are problems we need to solve if the American economy is going to truly grow.\n\nWhen these sorts of problems have popped up in the past, we've typically turned to with policy solutions. The only problem is: our policy solution machine is frozen.\n\nHundreds of bills sit on Senate Leader Mitch McConnell's desk, President Trump's increasing paranoia has him busy hunting enemies within his own administration, and each party's solution for the problems that plague us are diametrically opposed.\n\nPrecious little is getting done, and Trump has never displayed much of an interest in governing anyway. Now it seems his party isn't much interested in it either. All that leaves for them in the game of politics is the winning, which is what Republicans are interested in at all costs.\n\nThis inertia has been passed on to the market in the form of persistently low rates. It is a state of affairs that is not to be trusted. It isn't sustainable, and it won't fix itself either. The only question is, what will be the event large enough to make things matter again, to get things moving and force us to do price discovery and assign value?", "source": {"uri":

originally 3,711 crewmembers and guests - has been rapidly dwindling, as at least 542 cases of the virus have been diagnosed on board, and those ill people taken ashore for medical care by the Japanese Ministry of Health.\n\nAmericans, Canadians, Australians, and people from Hong Kong on the ship have been given the option to fly home to dry land for another 14-day period of isolation, and the most elderly, vulnerable passengers over 80 years old on the ship have been offered rooms and bento boxes on land to finish out their quarantines.\n\nAs for the rest of the healthy passengers who are still on board the Diamond Princess, today they are beginning to disembark, in a process that will take \"several consecutive days\" according to the cruise company, as passengers are tested, and test results confirmed negative, before people will be allowed to get off.\n\nBut the quarantining process doesn't necessarily end there for everyone.\n\nAnyone who shared a cabin with someone who came down with a case of COVID-19 while on board must stay on the ship even longer: 14 more days from when they separated from their sick roommate. Many countries, including the US, won't let any passengers who've stayed aboard come home for another two weeks after they leave the ship, either. (There are more than 100 US citizens still on board the Diamond Princess, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.)\n\nPublic health and bioethics experts say that this whole lockdown was completely unnecessary to begin with, and that the extra cases that incubated on board the ship could've been easily avoided, if passengers had just been let off, and monitored for coronavirus symptoms after they left.\n\n\"The quarantine was not justified, and violated the individual rights of the passengers while allowing the virus to literally pick them off one-by-one,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security told Business Insider in an email. \"The 14-day stipulation was meaningless in a context with new infections and new transmission episodes.\"\n\nOthers have been similarly vocal.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health in the US told USA Today that \"the quarantine process failed\" on board the Diamond Princess.\n\n\"I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed,\" Fauci said. \"People were getting infected on that ship. Something went awry.\"\n\nBioethicist and Rogue Bioethics co-founder Kelly Hills said that the quarantine on board the Diamond Princess wasn't just ineffective, it was \"absolutely pointless.\"\n\n\"I don't think that we have seen enough proof, in any cases, that quarantine is necessary for this particular virus,\" she said. \"It doesn't meet what we would consider the minimum standards necessary for violating somebody's civil rights.\"\n\nWhile COVID-19 appears to be easily transmissible among people living in close quarters (like, say, on a cruise ship) only about 2% of COVID-19 virus cases so far are fatal, which makes the disease far less deadly than SARS, while also far less transmissible than a virus like the measles (which infects about 90% of unprotected people who come in contact with it).\n\nHills said that self-containment measures at home would be more humane, and ultimately, probably more effective than quarantines for keeping healthy people disease-free.\n\n\"People just don't like to be forced to do things, especially if they don't feel like there's good justification,\" she said.\n\nTake the case of one Toronto SARS quarantine, in 2003. Less than 60% of the city actually complied with that order, and researchers later qualified it as both inefficient and ineffective, though \"massive in scale.\"\n\nGeorgetown Law professor Lawrence Gostin told Business Insider in an email that other COVID-19 quarantines taking place in military bases around the US, where hundreds more people have been confined, \"appear to be lawful,\" but said \"the key issue is whether they are justified.\"\n\nOther quarantine-like measures, happening inside Hubei province in China (where the virus originated) are not true quarantines, but instead aim to restrict people's movements, and encourage them to monitor for symptoms, so everyone has fewer chances to come in contact with the novel virus.\n\n\"If somebody is sick, keep an eye on them, ask them to stay indoors, explain why they need to stay indoors,\" Hills said. \"If they get sicker to the point where they need an ICU or other medical intervention, then you take them to the hospital, but there's no need to overwhelm hospitals.\"\n\nIn Singapore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong recently briefed residents on a similar three-pronged infection control approach, which does not include any quarantining, or stockpiling.\n\n\"There's no need to stock up with instant noodles, or tin food, or toilet paper\" Loong said \"We can each do our part. One, observe personal hygiene: wash your hands often, avoid touching your eyes or face unnecessarily. Two, take your own temperature, twice daily. And three, if you're not well, please avoid crowded places, and see a doctor immediately.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization has applauded the country's approach.\n\n\"Yesterday I spoke to Singapore's Minister of Health and we are very impressed with the efforts they are making to find every case, follow up with contacts, and stop transmission,\" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference on Tuesday. \"Singapore is leaving no stone unturned, testing every case of influenza-like illness and pneumonia. So far, they have not found evidence of community transmission.\"\n\nAdalja said at this point, nearly two full months into the COVID-19 outbreak, that the virus is \"not containable\" and instead of quarantines, the focus now should be on \"hospital preparedness, vaccine development, antiviral clinical trials,\" and better diagnostic tests.\n\n\"The whole idea of the cruise ship quarantine was ill-conceived, and the resultant slew of infections it spawned was completely predictable,\" Adalja said.\n\nIn other words, there is a reason that some people call cruise ships \"floating petri dishes.\"\n\nMore than 90% of gastrointestinal issues on board cruises stem from norovirus, but cruise ships also host flu viruses year-round, and the evidence so far suggests they seem to incubate the novel COVID-19 pretty well, too, both because of the cramped quarters where people can pass the virus to each other, and, possibly, through touching surfaces where it's possible the virus could live on for a matter of hours outside the body.\n\n\"Cruise ships are made of surfaces that are really sticky for viruses,\" Hills said. \"Lots of chrome and polished metal, things with grooves and nicks and scratches. It just makes a good home.\"\n\nRemarkably, however, given the cramped conditions below deck, only a few more than a dozen of the crew members aboard the Diamond Princess appear to have gotten sick with COVID-15, according to one tally by Al Jazeera last Thursday. That is a far smaller number than the count of sickened passengers who were staying above deck, which included more than 40 sick Canadians, and more than 50 ill Americans.\n\nThat difference, experts suspect, might have a lot to do with one simple move: better handwashing below deck, by members of a very well-trained, and disease-weary cruising crew.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Princess_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diamond Princess (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bioethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neonatal intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_(Richmond,_Virginia)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Diamond (Richmond, Virginia)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pragmatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yokohama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokohama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Center_for_Health_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

told The New York Times that it's \"hard to imagine prisoners' medical needs would be a priority of the government,\" particularly at a time when resources are stretched thin across a country wracked by COVID-19.\n\nJails in China are the new frontier for the coronavirus.\n\nMore than 500 cases of COVID-19 erupted across five penitentiaries across three provinces, according to the Ministry of Justice. This led to a spike in the national tally of the coronavirus, triggered fears of the virus spreading in clusters, and prompted several local officials to be sacked.\n\nThe coronavirus has, as of Friday, sickened nearly 76,000 people and killed over 2,200, according to Beijing's National Health Commission.\n\nAccording to Justice Ministry official He Ping, over half of the reported cases are in jails in Hubei, the province where the coronavirus outbreak originated in December. Wuhan Women's Prison has reported 230 cases and Shayang Hanjin Prison another 41, the New York Post said based on Agence France-Presse reports.\n\nThe warden of Wuhan Women's Prison was fired for being unable to prevent the outbreak, local newspaper Hubei Daily reported, the New York Post found.\n\nIn addition, 207 patients, which includes seven prison guards, were found at the Rencheng Prison in Jining, in the eastern province of Shandong. Thirty-four cases have occurred at Shilifen Prison in Zhejiang province, where officials enforced drastic measures, including locking people into their homes and banning weddings and funerals. Some people in custody at a juvenile detention center have also contracted COVID-19, per the South China Morning Post.\n\nIn Shandong, a guard at the Rencheng Prison developed a cough and began presenting other coronavirus symptoms in early February. Xie Weijun, Communist Party secretary of Shandong's Department of Justice, and seven prison authorities lost their jobs, according to local government officials.\n\n\"The implementation of our prevention and control measures have not been effective,\" Wu Lei, head of the province's prison administration, told the New York Post.\n\nThis situation was mirrored in Zhejiang province, where cases in Shilifen led to two prison officials, including its director, being ousted from their jobs.\n\nA police officer visited Wuhan in Japan, justice official Xu Xiaobo told the New York Post, but \"deliberately concealed\" this information and kept working.\n\n\"The policeman... was diagnosed with new coronavirus on Jan. 29. He had worked long hours and has come into contact with many people, causing many prisoners to become infected,\" Xu said, according to AFP. \"All patients are observed in isolation, and all confirmed patients are sent for treatment.\"\n\n\"With a heavy heart and sense of responsibility, I am reporting to you that as of February 20, five prisons in Hubei, Shandong, and Zhejiang have reported infections among their populations,\" Ping said.\n\nHowever, rumors of infections spiking in Shandong's prisons have been swirling on social media for a few days. Internet users in Jining say that some WeChat groups have been banned to halt these online conversations.\n\nTony Tang, originally from Jining, but now a New York resident, told the South China Morning Post that he learned about the spread of COVID-19 cases to Huxi Prison in Yutai County nearly a week ago through hometown friends. But the Jining Disease Prevention and Control Center told the news outlet that they had no such information.\n\nTang tweeted on Sunday night about a potential coronavirus outbreak just south of Jining. Soon, someone knocked at his parents' door.\n\n\"Within hours of me posting the message, security officials visited my parents who still live in Jining and asked them to tell me to delete the message. The speed of their response shows that they knew this was serious and [I felt something] was not normal,\" he told the Post.\n\nAccording to state news agency Xinhua, deputy secretary-general of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, China's top law enforcement agency, is heading a team that will examine the Rencheng Prison cases. The Post said he promised \"all out efforts\" to quarantine patients and get appropriate medical care for those who are sick.\n\nMeanwhile, penitentiaries across the nation have increased their screening of guards and officers to stop COVID-19 from entering \"prison premises\" Lei told the Post, adding that 28 teams have been dispatched to prisons around China to ensure compliance.\n\nAuthorities in Shangdong plan to \"quickly set up a hospital\" on the jail grounds, the Hubei Daily said, but many remain unconvinced.\n\n\"Prisoners are routinely denied access to adequate medical care even during normal times,\" Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, told The New York Times. \"Now with medical resources stretched to the limit in many areas in China, it is hard to imagine prisoners' medical needs would be a priority of the government.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors":
