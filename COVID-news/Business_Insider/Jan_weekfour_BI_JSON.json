The patient, who is being kept anonymous, had a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. Her breathing was \"coarse,\" doctors wrote, and she had a low white blood cell count -- a sign of infection.\n\nDoctors diagnosed her with the new coronavirus that has spread throughout China. As of Friday evening, more than 9,900 cases have been recorded and 213 people have died.\n\nIn a study released in the journal Radiology on Friday, a group of researchers at The First Hospital of Lanzhou University presented two of the woman's chest X-rays side by side.\n\nThe scans show white patches in the lower corner of her lungs, which indicate what radiologists call \"ground glass opacity.\"\n\n\"If you zoom in on the image, it kind of looks like faint glass that has been ground up,\" Paras Lakhani, a radiologist at Thomas Jefferson University who was not involved in the study but examined the images, told Business Insider. \"What it represents is fluid in the lung spaces.\"\n\nThe X-rays provide researchers a few new clues about the nature of the virus.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large group of viruses that typically affect the respiratory tract. They also cause pneumonia and the common cold. Symptoms of the new coronavirus include a fever, chills, headaches, difficulty breathing, and a sore throat.\n\nUntil December, it had never been seen in humans.\n\nThe novel coronavirus was first identified among a small group of people exhibiting pneumonia-like symptoms in Wuhan, China, in December. The 33-year-old patient whose lungs are shown in the new x-rays works in Wuhan, but had traveled to Lanzhou a day before her symptoms started.\n\n\"If you didn't know about this outbreak, you'd read the scan and you would just say, 'Okay, this patient has pneumonia,' because that's the most common thing we see,\" Lakhani said.\n\nOn its own, he added, ground glass isn't particularly helpful for identifying a coronavirus.\n\n\"You can see it with all types of infections -- bacterial, viral, or sometimes even non-infectious causes,\" Lakhani said. \"Even vaping could sometimes appear this way.\"\n\nBut the researchers also noticed that the ground-glass patches extend to the edges of the patient's lungs.\n\n\"That's something we don't often see,\" Lakhani said. \"We saw that with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and we saw that with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\"\n\nBoth SARS and MERS are also coronaviruses. An outbreak of the former in China resulted in 8,000 cases and 774 deaths from November 2002 to July 2003.\n\nLakhani said scans of those viruses have \"a lot of similar features\" to the images from the 33-year-old patient.\n\nThe researchers also saw that the white patches on the woman's lungs were more pronounced in the second image, taken three days after the first -- and further into her treatment. That helps rule out the possibility of pneumonia.\n\n\"Pneumonia usually doesn't rapidly progress,\" Lakhani said. \"Typically, most hospitals will treat with antibiotics and patients will stabilize and then start to get better.\"\n\nIn the hospital, the 33-year-old woman in Lanzhou inhaled a protein used to treat viral infections, called interferon. Lakhani guessed that doctors probably also administered \"supportive treatment,\" such as fluids, steroids, or a medication to open the woman's airways. But she continued to get worse.\n\nThat's significant, Lakhani said, since the same thing occurred in SARS patients.\n\nThe best way to diagnose the coronavirus isn't via X-rays, though -- it's a laboratory test, which involves taking swabs of saliva or mucus from a patient's nose and mouth or testing phlegm they may cough up.\n\nBut the test isn't perfect, since it can only detect the virus when a person is showing symptoms.\n\n\"We've seen people who had a detectable virus, then they didn't have a detectable virus, and then three days later they had a detectable virus,\" Robert Redfield, CDC director said in a briefing on Friday. \"We don't know the natural history of how this virus is secreted.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

All flights in and out of Wuhan have been canceled. Before the cancellations, any coming from Wuhan to the US were diverted to one of those five airports.\n\nThe man who contracted the virus landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport before the protocols were instated. Health officials in Washington said they were able to detect this case early, and the has been under strict isolation.\n\nChris Spitters, health officer for the Snohomish Health District, said during a CDC briefing on January 21 that the patient was \"hospitalized out of an abundance of precaution and for short-term monitoring, not because there was severe illness.\"\n\nThe man is reportedly in good health now.\n\nThree days later, a woman in her 60s became the second case reported in the US. She is being treated in Chicago.\n\nFoto: Employees in scrubs talk at the Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington, after the CDC announced the US' first coronavirus diagnosis, January 21, 2020.sourceReuters\n\nThe woman traveled to Wuhan in December to care for her elderly father, then returned to Chicago on January 13.\n\nShe did not exhibit any symptoms while traveling, but called her doctor a few days after returning to the US to report that she was feeling unwell. The patient was sent to a local hospital, where she was isolated and given fluids. Doctors are treating her symptoms much like they would pneumonia.\n\nAs of Friday, the woman was in stable condition. Local health officials said she did not take public transportation, attend any public gatherings, or have extensive contact with anyone outside her home since returning to Chicago.\n\n\"I want to start by stating clearly: This is a single travel-associated case, not a local emergency,\" Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said on Friday. \"I can reassure you that even with this Chicago case, the health risk to the general public from novel coronavirus remains low at this time.\"\n\nThree more US cases were confirmed on Sunday: two in California and one in Arizona.\n\nFoto: Travelers wear face masks at Hong Kong International Airport on January 23, 2020.sourceVIVEK PRAKASH/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOn January 22, a Wuhan resident who was traveling through Los Angeles International Airport on his way to China reported that he wasn't feeling well to airport staff. He was immediately taken to a local hospital.\n\nThe second California case was identified in Orange County. The patient there is being kept in isolation at a local hospital and is reported to be doing well.\n\nIn Arizona, meanwhile, a patient is also being kept in isolation. The individual lives in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located. Health officials described the patient as \"a member of the Arizona State University community\" but said the person does not live in university housing.\n\nAll three patients recently traveled from Wuhan.\n\nAt least 110 people across 26 states have been tested or are awaiting tests for the virus, the CDC said on Monday.\n\nFoto: Medical staff at the Zhongnan hospital in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province.sourceSTR/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAround 2,400 people have passed through airport screenings in the US.\n\nSo far, only five cases have come back positive. The CDC said 32 people have tested negative for the virus. The agency plans to test more people in the coming days.\n\nAuthorities haven't found any instances of human-to-human transmission in the US.\n\nFoto: A worker in protective suits checks the temperature of a passenger in Xianning, a city bordering Wuhan to the north.sourceREUTERS/Martin Pollard\n\nAt first, authorities suspected that the coronavirus - which likely originated at a wholesale seafood market - could only spread to humans from animals. But they later determined that humans can transmit the virus to one other.\n\nSince all five US patients recently traveled from Wuhan, there's no evidence that they passed the virus to other people in the US.\n\nThe CDC also said there's no evidence that the virus has spread through imported Chinese goods.\n\nThe CDC recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to China's Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.\n\nFoto: A traveler wearing a mask arrives on a direct flight from China at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.sourceReuters\n\n\"I expect that in the coming days, our travel recommendations will change,\" Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on Monday.\n\nFor now, people traveling to China are advised to avoid contact with sick people, particularly those with cold symptoms like coughs or runny noses.\n\nThe CDC also recommends that all travelers wash their hands frequently with soap and water, making sure to scrub for at least 20 seconds. They should refrain from touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nElderly travelers and anyone with preexisting health conditions should consult a doctor before traveling to China, the CDC said on Sunday.\n\nThe US government is planning to charter a flight to evacuate US diplomats and citizens from Wuhan.\n\nFoto: A largely empty train travels to Wuhan from Shanghai on January 23, 2020.sourceHECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe State Department plans to fly all of its American employees in Wuhan to San Francisco on Tuesday. US citizens who want a spot on the plane have been asked to contact the embassy.\n\nAll of Wuhan's public transportation - including buses, metros, ferries, and train - were shut down on Thursday. Trains and airplanes coming in and out of the city were halted and roadblocks were installed to keep taxis and private cars from exiting.\n\nWuhan's 11 million residents have been told not to leave the city, barring special circumstances.\n\nRobert Redfield, director of the CDC, said on Monday that \"the risk to the US public is now low.\"\n\nFoto: Passengers arrive at LAX from Shanghai, China.sourceReuters\n\n\"In today's connected world, an outbreak anywhere can be a risk everywhere,\" Redfield tweeted on Monday. \"Risk is dependent on exposure. 2019-nCoV is not spreading in the US at this time.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus has killed 81 people and infected more than 2,800.

At least 170 people have died, and 8,100 more have caught the virus - more than the total case count during the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak. Symptoms can range from mild to deadly and may look a lot like the flu. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nDoctors and public-health experts at the World Health Organization in Geneva have declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a \"public-health emergency of international concern\" (PHEIC).\n\nThe virus has so far sickened at least 8,100 people and killed 170 in China where it originated. Cases have been reported in 19 other countries around the globe.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak,\" WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday when he announced the emergency declaration. \"We don't know what sort of damage this virus could do if it were spread in a country with a weaker health system. We must act now to help countries prepare for that possibility.\"\n\nThe PHEIC designation is reserved by the WHO for the most serious, sudden, unexpected outbreaks that cross international borders. These diseases pose a public-health risk without bounds and may \"potentially require a coordinated international response,\" the WHO says on its website.\n\nThe global health emergency declaration has been around since 2005, and it's only been used five times before.\n\nA global emergency was declared for two Ebola outbreaks, one that started in 2013 in West Africa, and another that's been ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 2018. Other emergency alerts were used for the 2016 Zika epidemic, polio emerging in war zones in 2014, and for the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider De WOZ-waarde valt op de mat - 3 dingen om op te letten als je een lagere hypotheekrente wilt\n\nThe emergency designation puts the 196 member countries of the WHO on alert that they should step up precautions, such as screening travelers and monitoring international trade, in hopes of preventing the outbreak from spreading out of control.\n\nLast week, the WHO committee was split about whether to declare the new coronavirus outbreak - which experts suspect originated at an animal market in the city of Wuhan - an international emergency. Members delayed their final decision by a day, saying they needed more time to gather information about the virus's severity and transmissibility.\n\n\"This declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China,\" Ghebreyesus said on Thursday.\n\nSymptoms of the coronavirus, which is in the same family as the common cold, pneumonia, MERS, and SARS, can range from mild to deadly. Most of the fatalities so far have been among the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions. Only a laboratory test can confirm that a virus is the novel coronavirus.\n\nFoto: sourceSamantha Lee/Business Insider Read more: There is only one way to know if you have the coronavirus, and it involves machines full of spit and mucus The Wuhan coronavirus has spread from person to person in the US for the first time - to the husband of a woman who went to China The Wuhan coronavirus has killed 170 people and infected more than 8,100.

The thoughts expressed are those of the author.\n\nQuietly, as the US media watched senators ask questions about the President Donald Trump's imbroglio in Ukraine, and tallied the Wuhan coronavirus death toll around the world, China handed the president a major loss, one with national-security implications far outlasting his time in office.\n\nThe UK has decided to allow the Chinese telecom company Huawei to build out \"non-core\" elements of the 5G infrastructure. Huawei is prohibited from providing hardware for any sensitive sites, such as military bases or nuclear facilities, and after that will be limited to on 35% of market share.\n\nBoth domestically and internationally, this is an extremely controversial decision. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has labeled Huawei a \"high-risk vendor\" that could share information with the Chinese government. And the Trump administration absolutely hates this decision.\n\nFor months, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had made it clear that the fury of the Trump administration would rain down on its closest ally should Huawei be allowed to build out the pipes of Britain's communications system. Speaking in London in May, Pompeo claimed embracing Huawei could threaten US-UK intelligence sharing, a key part of the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence-sharing alliance.\n\nPompeo said that now was not the time for the US and the UK to \"go wobbly\" in the face of Chinese aggression, he brought up the \"Iron Lady\" -- Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister -- and challenged the UK government to consider whether she would countenance China's behavior.\n\nUnfortunately for Pompeo -- and the Trump administration -- all of this was in bad taste and bad timing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is one of Brexiteer nationalists who easily bristle under the bossiness of other countries. They were \"irritated\" by Pompeo's taunting and decided to allow Huawei to build some of its networks.\n\nAnd so it was that even in the midst of its most face-destroying crisis in nearly two decades -- an outbreak that the World Health Organization is calling a global emergency -- China still managed to rout Trump.\n\nThis is, of course, not how anyone treats their friends. There is no doubt that allowing Huawei to build these systems at least increases the risk that parts of the UK telecommunications systems could be compromised by the Chinese government. Whether or not limiting Huawei's participation in the build-out mitigates risk at all \"depends,\" according to James Andrew Lewis, the director of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"What it depends upon is how well the United Kingdom follows up on its plans for secure telecommunications,\" he wrote.\n\nInstead of berating the UK, the US could've just seen that what it really needed was a hand. Consider the position Johnson's government is in. Now that his country has left the European Union it will need to prove it has just as dynamic an economy as ever.\n\nThe country must battle the perception around the world that without the EU the whole of Britain will become a caricature of the most dilapidated members its aristocracy, a hollowed-out set poor in cash and rich in condescension, the kind whose drafty estates are rented out for fairy-tale weddings.\n\nIn other words, we could've tried to solve this problem with money. Huawei already has a presence in the UK's 4G systems, and changing out that infrastructure promised to be costly for UK telecom companies. Instead, the US decided to treat this as a problem to be dealt with the only way it knows how, with bellicosity and brutishness.\n\nThere is another way to do this, and it's the only way that can work in our world as it is. It is the only way that can work among friends. It is the way of cooperation.\n\n\"What's obviously needed is that all Western countries work more closely together to build a framework for telecommunications they want implemented in their infrastructure,\" Odd Arne Westad, Yale's Elihu Professor of History and Global Affairs and the author of \"The Cold War: A World History,\" told Business Insider. \"The problem is that, as you know, there is very little [cooperation]. That's what the US has to take the initiative.\"\n\nLast year Westad tried to explain how the US should deal with a rising China in a piece for Foreign Affairs titled \"The Sources of Chinese Conduct.\" If that sounds familiar, it's because it mirrors the famous memo written by diplomat George Kennan analyzing Soviet ideology on the eve of the Cold War.\n\nWestad says the West can only counter China with policies that make commercial sense for everyone, even a Britain working with the insecurity that comes with an uncertain future.\n\n\"This is what is different with the Cold War,\" Westad said. \"You could have export or import controls that corresponded to what the Soviets could deliver. That makes no sense in a world where Chinese technology is competitive.\"\n\nEither way, what Johnson may have calculated was that Trump and his ilk have a bark far worse than their bite. On Thursday, after the Johnson government's decision, Pompeo went to the UK and reinforced the importance of Five Eyes alliance. If there will be punishment for Johnson's departure from Trump, it will not come in this moment.\n\nAs the UK downplays the risks associated with trusting the Chinese Communist Party, the Wuhan coronavirus is showing the world how very real those risks are. The CCP -- under President Xi Jinping especially -- is a government that puts raw political power over all, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus has spread to every region in China, hundreds of people have already died, and many thousands have been infected. The tales from the ground are harrowing. Millions of people are trapped inside cities on lockdown across the country. A veteran journalist writing for China Media Project under the name Da Shiji reported that after Wuhan went into lockdown on January 23, vegetable prices skyrocketed by noon.\n\nDa also chronicles the days and days of inaction that led to the announcement of the outbreak. Chinese officials still operate in a system in which politics takes precedent above all else -- including safety. So even as China's top scientists rushed to find the source of the disease, its politicians stayed silent.\n\nAccording to Da, as late as January 17, Chinese officials were urging people to visit the territory, and large public events were still happening as planned despite signs of an outbreak.\n\nFrom Da:\n\n\"There was no attempt to stem the flow of people to Wuhan from all over the country and around the world. During what was the most critical phase for controlling the outbreak, Wuhan was essentially an open city owing to the efforts of local officials to keep a lid on the story.\"\n\nThe same stunning state power that makes it possible for the government to bring major cities to standstill is the same one scrubbing the internet of information about the virus. The New York Times reported that \"some users started replacing Mr. Xi's name with 'Trump.' As in, 'I don't want to go through another minute of this year, my heart is filled with pain, I hope Trump dies.'\"\n\nWhile the Chinese government is showing us that it cannot be trusted to manage a crisis without putting the survival of its authoritarian system above all, the US government is showing us that it cannot competently manage the diplomacy necessary to mitigate the dangers of that system's rise.\n\nIf these are our options for leadership on a bipolar planet, God help us all.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors":

The MDPH said the Centers for Disease Control notified state and local agencies of the positive test result on Friday night.\n\nPer the MDPH, the Boston man had recently traveled to Wuhan, the city in China's Hubei province where the outbreak originated. The man sought medical attention soon after his return to the US, the release said, adding that he had been isolated since seeking medical help. His \"few close contacts\" are being watched for signs of the virus, the agency added.\n\nThe man will stay in isolation until he is cleared by public health officials, according to the MDPH.\n\n\"Our priority is not only to protect and inform the residents of Boston but also to help this man continue to recover. We are pleased that he is doing well,\" Boston Public Health Commission Executive Director Rita Nieves said in the press release. \"Right now, we are not asking Boston residents to do anything differently. The risk to the general public remains low. And we continue to be confident we are in a good position to respond to this developing situation.\"\n\nAs Business Insider previously reported, seven other cases of the virus have been reported throughout the US, in Arizona, California, and Washington.\n\nThe disease, which has killed at least 259 and infected nearly 12,000, mainly in China, has spread to 22 countries around the globe, including Australia, Cambodia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, the US, and Vietnam.\n\nPresident Trump on January 31 banned foreign nationals who visited China within the past two weeks from entering the US, though US citizens, their immediate families, and permanent residents are not included in the ban. US citizens who have traveled to China's Hubei province must undergo 14 days in isolation upon returning to the country.\n\nRead more:\n\n9,000 Hong Kong hospital workers are threatening to strike amid coronavirus outbreak if the government doesn't close its border with mainland China\n\nApple shuts down all stores and corporate offices in China amid the continued Wuhan coronavirus outbreak\n\nScientists have published over 50 studies on Wuhan coronavirus in the last 3 weeks.

In Australia, there are five confirmed cases of the coronavirus - four in Sydney and one in Victoria, the ABC reported.\n\nLast week, the University of Queensland was asked by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. \"The team hopes to develop a vaccine over the next six months, which may be used to help contain this outbreak,\" Head of the university's School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, Professor Paul Young, said in a statement at the time. \"The vaccine would be distributed to first responders, helping to contain the virus from spreading around the world.\"\n\nThe Smart Traveller website, handled by the Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has advised Australians to \"reconsider\" their need to travel to China.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharon_masige@businessinsider.com", "name": "Sharon Masige", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_C._Doherty", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter C.

under their care, including one 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who tested positive for the coronavirus for 10 days.\n\nThe drug treatment includes a mixture of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, in combination with flu drug oseltamivir in large doses.\n\n\"This is not the cure, but the patient's condition has vastly improved.

Experts reveal why it's causing panic anyway.", "body": "Still, preventative measures like increased handwashing and not touching your face protect against coronavirus and other illnesses.\n\nThe outbreak of a new coronavirus has sparked fear and anxiety around the world.\n\nThe pneumonialike virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has infected more than 8,100 people and killed 170.\n\nSo far, the virus does not seem to be as deadly as SARS, which killed 774 people from 2002 to 2003. SARS had a mortality rate of 9.6%, whereas about 2% of people infected with the new coronavirus have died. But the number of people infected after one month has already surpassed the SARS outbreak's eight-month total.\n\nMany patients with coronavirus have already made full recoveries. According to Chinese officials, most of those who've died were elderly or had other ailments that compromised their immune systems.\n\nExperts say that for the most part, global panic over the Wuhan coronavirus is unproductive and unwarranted: The public should take precautions to avoid getting sick, but the most effective preventative measures are everyday actions like increased handwashing and not touching your face.\n\nAn expert also said fear would not stop the spread of the virus and could cause negative social impacts.\n\n\"There's the spread of infectious disease, then there's the spread of panic,\" Amira Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University, told Business Insider. \"They have very different mechanisms.\"\n\nIn the early stages of an infectious-disease outbreak, Roess added, much of the panic is \"fear of the unknown.\"\n\nPsychological research shows novel threats raise anxiety levels more than familiar threats and that people tend to underreact to familiar threats.\n\nFor example, there's about a one-in-seven chance that heart disease will be the cause of an American's death, whereas the chance they will die at the hands of a foreign-born terrorist is one in 45,808. But according to a 2016 Chapman University survey of American fears, \"terrorist attack on nation\" and \"victim of terrorism\" both ranked among the top five worries of the respondents.\n\nThis dynamic played out during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2014 to 2016, according to Paul Slovic, a psychologist and the president of the nonprofit Decision Research.\n\n\"What happened was quite consistent with what we know about risk perception,\" Slovic wrote in an article for the American Psychology Association. \"The minute the Ebola threat was communicated, it hit all of the hot buttons: It can be fatal, it's invisible and hard to protect against, exposure is involuntary, and it's not clear that the authorities are in control of the situation.\"\n\nPast outbreaks of Ebola, however, had much higher death rates than SARS and the new coronavirus: 25 to 90%. Worldwide, Ebola has killed more than 33,000 people since 1976.\n\nNationals of Asian descent in France, Canada, and the US are reporting incidents of racism because of public fears of the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\nThe Guardian reported nearly 9,000 parents near Toronto have signed a petition to prevent students who had traveled to China in the past 17 days from attending school.\n\n\"This has to stop. Stop eating wild animals and then infecting everyone around you,\" one petition signer wrote. \"Stop the spread and quarantine yourselves or go back.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that businesses throughout Hong Kong, South Korea, and Vietnam have posted signs telling customers from mainland China they are not welcome.\n\nAsian students at Arizona State University, meanwhile - where a US case of coronavirus was confirmed - said they were facing jokes, stares, and isolation on campus.\n\n\"I cough in class and everybody looks at me,\" a Vietnamese American freshman at ASU told Business Insider's Bryan Pietsch.\n\nMisinformation about the coronavirus has spread as well - no, oregano oil will not cure it, nor will drinking bleach.\n\nExperts say a few factors should ease fears about the coronavirus: First, it was identified and determined to be a new virus more quickly than ever before. A week after it was discovered, Chinese authorities had already sequenced the virus and shared it with labs around the world.\n\n\"Something that's remarkable here is that within a week, the RNA sequences of the virus are available on the internet, and many can look at it and begin to understand it,\" Richard Martinello, an associate professor of infectious disease at the Yale School of Medicine, told Business Insider. \"That's something that's never been done before.\"\n\nSecond, a variety of advancements in medical technology since coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s have allowed clinical labs and virologists to conduct more in-depth research into the way these zoonotic viruses work.\n\nFor example, though scientists knew coronaviruses could infect humans because they're a cause of the common cold, the SARS outbreak marked the first time a coronavirus was traced back to animals. (It's possible, however, that coronaviruses from animals have made people sick in the past, Martinello said.)\n\nMartinello also said people in the US were far more likely to catch the seasonal flu than the Wuhan coronavirus. The preventative measures for both are the same: handwashing, avoiding face touching, and steering clear of contact with anyone who's sick.\n\nMartinello hopes that the widespread worry about the coronavirus will lead to lower rates of seasonal flu this year as people take better precautions.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"},

Bryant said in a podcast in 2018 that he began traveling in helicopters so he would have more time to spend with his daughters instead of sitting in LA traffic. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe late NBA legend Kobe Bryant and his wife Vanessa had a pact that they would never ride in a helicopter together, a source told People magazine.\n\nBryant, 41, and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, as well as seven other passengers, were killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, on Sunday morning.\n\n\"He and Vanessa had a deal that they would never fly on a helicopter together,\" a source told People. The source also added that Bryant would only ride in helicopters piloted by Ara Zobayan, who was among the seven others killed in the crash. It was not immediately made clear why Bryant made the pact with his wife.\n\nWhile it's true that there are very few photos of the couple together on helicopter rides, they did document one trip on Valentine's Day 2015. The photos, which were posted on Vanessa's now-private Instagram, were saved in a celebrity blog at the time.\n\nBryant shared one photo of the Valentine's Day trip on his Instagram, with the caption \"Happy Valentine's Day #Vino #QueenV.\"\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Het nieuwe coronavirus komt helemaal niet van slangen maar vrijwel zeker van vleermuizen, stellen twee vooraanstaande Utrechtse virologen View this post on Instagram\n\nHappy Valentine's Day #Vino #QueenV\n\nA post shared by Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) on Feb 14, 2015 at 5:18pm PST\n\nBryant and Gianna are survived by his wife and his three daughters - Natalia, 17; Bianka, 3; and Capri, who was born in June of last year.\n\nBryant said in a 2018 podcast for Barstool Sports that he began traveling in helicopters so he would have more time to spend with his daughters instead of sitting in Los Angeles traffic.\n\n\"Traffic started getting really, really bad, and I was sitting in traffic and I wound up missing like a school play, because I was sitting in traffic,\" Bryant said during the podcast. \"I had to figure out a way where I could still train and focus on the craft but still not compromise family time.\n\n\"So that's when I looked into helicopters, to be able to get down and back in 15 minutes and that's when it started,\" he added.\n\nIn the podcast, Bryant elaborated how important family time was to him, even if it was just to drop them off at school.\n\nRead more: Kobe Bryant, 41, dies in helicopter crash in Calabasas, California The helicopter that carried Kobe Bryant and 8 others before crashing on a hillside did not have a black box on board, investigators say Here are the 9 victims of the Calabasas helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant and his daughter", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_frias@businessinsider.com", "name": "Lauren Frias", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabasas,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Calabasas_helicopter_crash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 Calabasas helicopter crash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight recorder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Driving", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Driving", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Traffic_Control", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Traffic Control", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Online_Traffic_Cameras", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Online Traffic Cameras", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e30d72a62fa815a4378e8f5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5463516", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 219}, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1430517757", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-31", "time": "16:11:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-31T16:11:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-31T16:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-flight-suspensions-delta-suspends-china-flights-american-united-2020-1", "title": "Delta just suspended China flights for longer than any other airline, a red flag as the unprecedented coronavirus wreaks havoc on the airline industry", "body": "Delta Air Lines said on Friday that it was suspending all its flights to China from February 6 to April 30.
