At the end of March, the state governor issued an executive order banning big-box stores from selling non-essential items.\n\n\"Large 'big box' retailers generate significant shopping traffic by virtue of their size and the variety of goods offered in a single location,\" Vermont's Agency of Commerce and Community Development Secretary Lindsay Kurrle said in a statement to the press at the time.\n\nShe added: \"This volume of shopping traffic significantly increases the risk of further spread of this dangerous virus to Vermonters and the viability of Vermont's health care system. We are directing these stores to put public health first and help us reduce the number of shoppers.\"\n\nThe only way that customers can shop for these non-essential items is by using online delivery services or curbside pickup.\n\nThe board of commissioners in Howard County, Indiana enforced a similar rule earlier in March, which also prevented any businesses in the area that were deemed to be \"essential\" from selling non-essential items.\n\nIn a press release announcing the news, the board said that it had received complaints from other businesses, which had been forced to close as they sold mostly non-essential items, that it was unfair for stores to continue selling these products.\n\nRetail workers in the area also complained that customers were congregating in stores and browsing non-essential goods because they were \"bored at home,\" thus filling up the aisles and putting these workers at greater risk.\n\nThere have been reports elsewhere of other counties putting similar rules into play.\n\nWhile some shoppers have taken a dislike to these new restrictions, others are applauding the change and are encouraging other local governments to do the same.", "source": {"uri":

Seventy-six were stock purchases of as much as $1.8 million. The report also documents 34 stock sales worth as much as $825,000.

according to a report Saturday from The Washington Post.\n\n\"We told them very clearly that the president was not going to sign the bill if [money for the Postal Service] was in it,\" a Trump administration official told the Post. \"I don't know if we used the v-bomb, but the president was not going to sign it, and we told them that.\"\n\nIn addition to the senior White House official, The Washington Post reported a congressional official also confirmed the president threatened to refuse to sign the $2.2 trillion stimulus package known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act if it contained any relief money for the postal service.\n\nAs The Post reported, Sens. Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, and Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, added a last-minute $10 billion loan to keep the postal service function in the short-term. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said lawmakers' plan to offer $13 billion in funding to the postal service could derail the entire package.\n\n\"You can have a loan or you can have nothing at all,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nAs Business Insider previously reported, lawmakers last month warned that the postal service could shut down in less than three months.\n\n\"Based on a number of briefings and warnings this week about a critical fall-off in mail across the country, it has become clear that the Postal Service will not survive the summer without immediate help from Congress and the White House,\" Reps. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, and Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia, said in a statement.\n\nA halt in USPS operations could have varying consequences from preventing access to medication to impacting voters who cast ballots by mail as state lawmakers consider expanding main-in-voting due to the pandemic.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Megan Brennan, postmaster general & CEO of USPS said it estimated a net operating loss of over $22 billion dollars over the next eighteen months, and by over $54 billion dollars in \"the longer term.\"\n\n\"As Congress and the Administration take steps to support businesses and industries around the country, it is imperative that they also take action to shore up the finances of the Postal Service, and enable us to continue to fulfill our indispensable role during the pandemic, and to play an effective role in the nation's economic recovery,\" Brennan said.\n\nThe postal service and its board of governors is asking Congress for a $50 billion bailout as well as $25 billion in loans from the Treasury Department. The president on Tuesday blamed online retailers -- like Amazon -- for killing the postal service, which has for years reported losses unrelated to its COVID-19 struggles.\n\n\"This is the new one. I'm the demise of the Postal Service,\" Trump said. \"I'll tell you who's the demise of the Postal Service, are these internet companies that give their stuff to the Postal Service.\"\n\nAbout 500 USPS workers have tested positive for COVID-19 and 462 others are presumed positive, postal service leaders told lawmakers, according to The Washington Post. More than 6,000 are in self-quarantine due to potential exposure and 19 have died, according to the report.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"},

hours. Here's how to disinfect surfaces properly.", "body": "The coronavirus is primarily a respiratory illness, and it typically spreads via airborne droplets from an infected person's coughs or sneezes. Viral particles can survive for a time on surfaces, but the coronavirus' lifespan on surfaces depends on various factors like temperature and humidity. New research suggests the coronavirus can last between three hours and seven days on surfaces, depending on the material. Here are some best practices for disinfecting common surfaces. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe new coronavirus is a respiratory illness, so it typically spreads via airborne droplets. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets carrying viral particles can land on someone else's nose or mouth or get inhaled.\n\nBut a person can get the coronavirus if they touch a surface or object that has viral particles on it and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes. The lifespan of the virus on a surface - a subway pole, a stairwell banister, or even money - depends on many factors, including the surrounding temperature, humidity, and type of surface.\n\nA study published April 2 in the journal The Lancet shows that the virus lasts longest - up to seven days - on stainless steel, plastic, and surgical masks.\n\nHow long the coronavirus could survive on surfaces\n\nThe researchers behind the new study tested the virus' lifespan in a 71-degree Fahrenheit room at 65% relative humidity. After three hours, the virus had disappeared from printing and tissue paper. It took two days for it to leave from wood and cloth fabric. After four days, it was no longer detectable on glass or paper money. It lasted longest, seven days, on stainless steel and plastic.\n\nStrikingly, the authors wrote, of all the materials they tested, the coronavirus lasted longest on the outer layer of a surgical mask. On day seven of their investigation, the virus was still present on the outward facing side of the mask.\n\nFoto: Workers wearing protective gear spray disinfectant as a precaution against the new coronavirus at a department store in Seoul, South Korea, March 2, 2020. Source: Lee Jin-man/Associated Press\n\nThe study followed earlier research that also tested the coronavirus' lifespan on household surfaces. The prior study, published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggests the virus can live up to four hours on copper, up to a day on cardboard, and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. That's in a 70-degree Fahrenheit room at 40% relative humidity.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Op deze 11 manieren hebben pandemie\u00ebn de loop van de wereldgeschiedenis in de afgelopen 2000 jaar bepaald\n\nThe researchers compared the new coronavirus' lifespan on surfaces to that of the SARS coronavirus. They found that both coronaviruses lived the longest on stainless steel and polypropylene, a type of plastic used in everything from toys to car parts. Both viruses lasted up to three days on plastic, and the new coronavirus lasted up to three days on steel.\n\nOn cardboard, however, the new coronavirus lasted three times longer than SARS did: 24 hours, compared to eight hours.\n\nSmooth surfaces are better for the coronavirus\n\nAnother study, published March 1 in the Journal of Hospital Infection, looked at the lifespans of other coronaviruses found in humans on various surfaces. The SARS coronavirus, at a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), lasted for two days on steel, four days on wood and glass, and five days on metal, plastic, and ceramics. (The researchers also found that one strain of SARS lasted up to nine days on a plastic surface at room temperature.)\n\nSARS survived for two to eight hours on aluminum and for less than eight hours on latex.\n\nAccording to Rachel Graham, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, smooth, nonporous surfaces like doorknobs and tabletops are better at carrying viruses in general. Porous surfaces - like money, hair, and cloth fabric - don't allow viruses to survive as long because the small spaces or holes in them can trap the microbe and prevent its transfer, Graham told Business Insider.\n\n\"Coins will transmit a virus better than cash, but this shouldn't be a huge concern,\" she said. \"Basic rule of thumb should be to consider money dirty anyway, because it is. It goes through too many hands not to be.\"\n\nFoto: A man holding coins collected from the Trevi Fountain in Rome. Source: Marco Di Lauro/Getty\n\nYour smartphone, with all its glass and aluminum, can also carry viral particles.\n\nGraham recommended disinfecting your phone, \"particularly if it travels to the bathroom with you.\"\n\nThe surrounding temperature makes a big difference\n\nThe Journal of Hospital Infection study also found that spikes in temperature made a difference in the lifespans of coronaviruses. An 18-degree Fahrenheit jump, from 68 degrees to 86 degrees, decreased how long SARS lasted on steel surfaces by at least half.\n\nThe Lancet study found a similar link between the virus' lifespan and the surrounding temperature. At 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit), the virus lasted up to two weeks in a test tube. When the temperature was turned up to 37 degrees Celsius (99 degrees Fahrenheit), that lifespan dropped to one day.\n\nThat's because some coronaviruses, including this new one, have a viral envelope: a fat layer that protects viral particles when traveling from person to person in the air. That sheath can dry out, however, killing the virus. So higher humidity, moderate temperatures, low wind, and a solid surface are all good for a coronavirus' survival, Graham said.\n\nFoto: A volunteer offers hand sanitizer to passengers who recently arrived in Hong Kong from mainland China on February 4. Source: Willie Siau/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nThis also explains why respiratory viruses are typically seasonal: Cooler temperatures help harden the protective gel-like coating that surrounds the particles.\n\nHow to disinfect surfaces\n\nThe authors of the Journal of Hospital Infection study noted that human coronaviruses could be \"efficiently inactivated\" on surfaces within one minute if they're cleaned with solutions containing 62% to 71% ethanol alcohol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite.\n\n\"We expect a similar effect against the SARS-CoV-2,\" they added.\n\nFoto: A member of the medical team sprays disinfectant to sanitize bathrooms in a shrine in Iran on February 27. Source: WANA (West Asia News Agency) via Reuters\n\nGraham said these surface disinfectants could even work within 15 seconds.\n\n\"To get the kill rates advertised on the packaging, though, that usually involves waiting for several minutes - between five minutes and six minutes,\" she added, though that duration is probably essential only if you're cleaning a surface in an area where someone's infected.\n\nSimilarly, the recent Lancet study submerged a concentrated virus sample in household bleach, ethanol at 70% concentration, and other disinfectants; the results suggested they all killed the coronavirus within five minutes at room temperature. Hand soap, however, took 15 minutes.\n\nGraham said the important thing when disinfecting a surface is getting the potential infectious dose of the virus below a level that will cause disease.\n\n\"Most commercial products labeled 'disinfectants' talk about a 99.9% kill rate,\" she said - that should bring the dose below the threshold that would make people ill. But alcohol-based hand sanitizer is not ideal for disinfecting hard surfaces because the alcohol content is not high enough.\n\nFoto: Source: REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nHand sanitizer is meant to lower how much of the infection is on your hands \"without stripping your skin of all its oils and moisture,\" Graham said. \"Surface disinfectants - like Lysol, bleach - are better for surfaces.\"\n\nStop touching your face, and wash your hands\n\nGraham emphasized the importance of washing your hands and not touching your face - those are the best ways to minimize your chance of picking up the coronavirus from surfaces.\n\nThe study in the Journal of Hospital Infection concluded that if a person spent five seconds touching a surface where the influenza A virus lives, 32% of the virus living on that surface could transfer to their hands.\n\nFoto: A man with a face mask rides the subway in the Queens borough of New York City on February 2. Source: Nick Zieminski/Reuters\n\n\"If you're about to eat, fix your makeup, play with the baby, etc., wash your hands,\" she said.\n\nShe also suggested washing your hair if it gets sneezed on, even though the virus doesn't last very long on it.\n\nOf course, the coronavirus can't infect you through your hands, so if you never touch your eyes, nose, mouth, you can avoid infection.\n\nFoto: A currency trader wearing a face mask watches monitors at KEB Hana Bank in Seoul on March 5.

Graham said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aylin_woodward@businessinsider.com", "name": "Aylin Woodward", "type":

voting by mail creates potential for voter fraud, but US troops have been voting that way for years.\n\nDespite the fact that most service members and their families cast their ballots by mail during every election, President Donald Trump feels that voting by mail poses a threat to holding fair elections in November.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump tweeted that Republicans should oppose efforts by the Democrats to allow for statewide voting in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic. In Wisconsin, voters waited for hours in rain and hail to vote in Tuesday's primary election after the Supreme Court refused to allow state residents to vote by mail in order to avoid getting sick.\n\nThe president argued that if states allow voters to submit their ballots by mail, it would create a \"tremendous potential for voter fraud\" and would also work against Republicans, Trump tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, more than two-thirds of service members who voted in the 2018 elections submitted an absentee ballot, said Meghan Kelly, state legislative affairs specialist for the Federal Voting Assistance Program.\n\n\"Election offices sent 655,409 absentee ballots to military and overseas voters in 2018 and received 344,392 back, for a return rate of 53%,\" according to FVAP's latest report to Congress. \"The rejection rate was 6%.\"\n\nAbout 75% of the 1.3 million active-duty service members are eligible to vote absentee under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act because they are stationed away from their voting residence, Kelly said in a statement to Task & Purpose.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he never saw evidence of fraud in the military's voting system when he served in the Army or later when he became a senator.\n\n\"The first time I ever voted in my life was I voted by absentee mail from Vietnam in November of 1968,\" Hagel told Task & Purpose on Wednesday. \"I voted while sitting on top of a tank in Vietnam. A lot of guys that I knew in Vietnam were old enough to vote and voted by absentee ballot. I never heard of any problems. I never heard about any issues or anybody charging there was fraud, waste, or abuse in any process that involves voting absentee by mail.\"\n\nHagel remembers that he cast his ballot for Richard M. Nixon -- who later wrote Trump a 1987 letter encouraging him to run for office.\n\nRetired Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden, who led both the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, tweeted that he voted by mail for 40 years.\n\nMoreover, the president himself acknowledged on Tuesday that he had voted by mail in last month's Florida primary election. He argued he was allowed to vote absentee because he was out of the state.\n\n\"No, I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing,\" the president told reporters during a White House news conference. \"I think if you vote, you should go.\"\n\nBut Retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey pointed out that states rely on volunteer poll workers for in-person voting, and these volunteers tend to be elderly -- exactly the demographic that is most at risk of getting the coronavirus.\n\nMeanwhile, states can check for voter fraud by seeing if hundreds of people with the exact same home address are trying to cast separate ballots, McCaffrey told Task & Purpose on Wednesday.\n\n\"Obviously, the armed forces deserve to vote and we routinely in every state get absentee ballots,\" McCaffrey said.\n\n\"So the hypocrisy of the president's position is utterly mind-boggling. It's like Bizarro Land to stand up there and say: I'm voting by mail from the White House; I'm too important to risk my health to go to Florida.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com",

A new report published in the journal Lancet found the virus lasted on the outside of a surgical mask for 7 days. Given their findings, one of the researchers conducting the study advised people not to touch the outside of the face masks, which could contaminate the hands. Researchers also doubled down on previous precautionary measures that washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and staying home are the best ways to protect yourself from COVID-19. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSince the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, researchers have been studying how long it can live on various surfaces, from cardboard to stainless steel.\n\nThe novel coronavirus is primarily a respiratory illness, and it typically spreads via airborne droplets from an infected person's coughs or sneezes, but it can also be transmitted on objects if you grab something that has enough virus on it then touch your face.\n\nThis growing body of research has been used to help guide recommendations on how the public can protect themselves from COVID-19.\n\nA new report published in Lancet studied the stability and amount of virus present over time on various surfaces, including tissues, wood, and cloth.\n\nThey were surprised to find the novel coronavirus on the outside of a face mask a week later.\n\n\"Strikingly, a detectable level of infectious virus could still be present on the outer layer of a surgical mask on day 7,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nFace masks, particularly surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks, have been in high demand - and short supply -since the outbreak.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Op deze 11 manieren hebben pandemie\u00ebn de loop van de wereldgeschiedenis in de afgelopen 2000 jaar bepaald\n\nAfter the White House recommended that all Americans wear face coverings in public, officials are increasingly suggesting that people craft their own out of scarves, bandanas, or T-shirts to save face masks for medical workers on the frontlines battling COVID-19.\n\nThere isn't much scientific evidence that masks help prevent infection from spreading in a population, except when you put them on the people who are already sick, Business Insider's Hilary Brueck explained. Scientists are in consensus that staying home and social distancing as much as possible are the best ways to decrease the number of infections and \"flatten the curve.\"\n\nProperly wearing and taking off face masks is key\n\nThe researchers, including Leo Poon Lit-man and Malik Peiris, said their findings show how important it is to properly wear and remove masks.\n\n\"This is exactly why it is very important if you are wearing a surgical mask you don't touch the outside of the mask,\" Peiris told the South China Morning Post. \"Because you can contaminate your hands, and if you touch your eyes you could be transferring the virus to your eyes.\"\n\nThe CDC recommends wearing a snug, cloth face covering that goes over your mouth and nose, and that you wash it frequently in a washing machine. When you take it off, avoid touching the front of the mask where it's dirtiest, and wash you hands directly after.\n\nWash your hands with soap and water\n\nThe research team, which included scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also found that the coronavirus was more stable on smooth surfaces. Previous research found that the coronavirus can live on copper for 4 hours, on cardboard for 24 hours, and on plastic for three days - but the lifespan of the coronavirus is also impacted by various factors such as temperature and humidity.\n\nThat's why officials recommend regularly disinfecting household objects that people touch often, such as doorknobs, countertops, and phones.\n\nFor those worried about carrying viral particles while getting groceries or other essential items from the store, Poon said you should leave non-perishable items in their shopping bags for a day before handling them again.\n\n\"That would reduce the viral titre [concentration] a lot,\" he added.\n\nPoon also doubled down on existing recommendations that washing your hands with soap is one of the best ways to protect yourself.\n\n\"If you want to protect yourself just maintain good hygiene, wash your hands often and try not to touch your face, your mouth, or nose without cleaning first,\" Poon told the

It is not discounted.\"\n\nThere are two scientific labs close to Wuhan where scientists are believed to have been carrying out tests on viruses: the Institute of Virology and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control.\n\nBoth are within 10 miles of the animal market where the outbreak is widely believed to have started late last year.\n\nSome scientists in the US believe an accidental laboratory leak is a plausible theory, The Washington Post columnist David Ignatius said last week.\n\nOne biologist Ignatius pointed to was Richard Ebright, a professor at Rutgers University's Waksman Institute of Microbiology.\n\nEbright was quoted in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists as saying many of the scientists in Wuhan who had been researching viruses had only \"minimal protections\" against infection.\n\n\"Virus collection, culture, isolation, or animal infection at BSL-2 [moderate biosafety level] with a virus having the transmission characteristics of the outbreak virus would pose substantial risk of infection of a lab worker, and from the lab worker, the public,\" he said.\n\nHe went on to say the evidence available left \"a basis to rule out a lab construct, but no basis to rule out a lab accident.\"\n\nIn other words, while the virus was not believed to have been created in a lab, it could have been studied in one and released in an accident.\n\nJohnson's government has reportedly started to question the veracity of China's statements regarding the coronavirus.\n\nLast week it was reported that UK officials were furious with the Chinese state.\n\nOn March 29, the senior UK lawmaker Michael Gove told the BBC he was skeptical of China's official virus numbers.\n\n\"The first case of coronavirus in China was established in December of last year, but it was also the case that some of the reporting from China was not clear about the scale, the nature, the infectiousness of this,\" he said.\n\nA report by the UK Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee last week accused the Chinese government of spreading disinformation about the spread of the virus.\n\n\"Disinformation about COVID-19 has already cost lives,\" the committee said.\n\n\"It is essential that the Government issues clear and transparent messages at home to confront and rebut disinformation spread by foreign powers.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

so he can 'exert significant influence over the party platform'", "body": "Entering the DNC in August with as many national delegates as possible could give Sanders leverage to influence the party's platform and the next convention.\n\nBernie Sanders announced the suspension of his presidential campaign on Wednesday, but the Vermont Senator's not done with the Democratic party yet.\n\nThough his decision clears the way for former vice president Joe Biden to become the presumptive Democratic nominee, Sanders declared that he would remain on the ballot in upcoming primary states and continue to collect national delegates, with the intention of arriving at the Democratic National Convention wielding enough power to influence the party's platform. The strategy could ensure that even if Sanders' name is not at the top of the Democratic ticket in November, his policy priorities would still prevail and have influence for years to come.\n\n\"Today I congratulate Joe Biden, a very decent man, who I will work with to move our progressive ideas forward,\" Sanders said in a live stream for supporters on Wednesday.\n\nHe then pledged, \"I will stay on the ballot in all remaining states and continue to gather delegates.\"\n\n\"While Vice President Biden will be the nominee, we must continue working to assemble as many delegates as possible at the Democratic Convention, where we will be able to exert significant influence over the party platform, and other functions,\" Sanders said.\n\nWhy Sander's strategy matters for the convention -- and beyond\n\nSanders might not be the Democratic nominee for 2020, but he can still influence the party's agenda by racking up as many delegates as possible heading into the convention. On Wednesday, he made no attempt to hide his intention to do so.\n\nAs of April 8, 1,719 national delegates have yet to be allocated in the primary.\n\nA total of 21 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have yet to hold their Democratic presidential primary or causes, and 15 of these states had moved their primary date because of concerns voting could not safely take place due to the coronavirus.\n\nThe DNC, which takes place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin this year, has been rescheduled to the week of August 17 to do concerns about the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe convention's purpose isn't just to officially choose a presidential ticket. At the national convention, the party also codifies its official platform and sets rules for the next convention.\n\nTo do so, the DNC establishes standing committees on party platforms, rules, and credentials. Each committee must consist of 162 members, and each committee's membership is allocated proportionally by how many national delegates a candidate received during the primary.\n\nTherefore, Sanders' performance in the national delegate race will influence how many of his supporters will wind up on these critical committees. If he were to win enough delegates to proportionally receive 81 members on each committee, for instance, he would have a majority. He won't, but getting close to that number -- or ensuring that the establishment wing doesn't get much more than that number -- gives his wing of the party a tactical advantage while advocating for their policies and the contours of the 2024 or 2028 primary.\n\nOne of the most critical bodies in this process is the platform committee, which is responsible for drafting and recommending the official party platform to the Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn his concession speech, Sanders said he would continue to fight for progressive proposals at the core of his campaign campaign, including an overhaul of the America's healthcare and criminal justice systems, and protections for unemployed people and blue collar workers.\n\nHaving a strong presence on the platform committee could enable Sanders to enshrine at least some of these priorities into the official party platform.\n\n\"I ran for the presidency because I believe that as a president, I could accelerate and institutionalize the progressive changes that we are all building together,\" Sanders said near the end of his concession speech. \"And if we keep organizing and fighting, I have no doubt that that is exactly what will happen.\n\n\"While the path may be slower,\" he continued, \"Now, we will change this nation, and with like minded friends around the globe, change the entire world.\"", "source":

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nPresident Donald Trump weighed allowing the novel coronavirus to \"wash over\" the US as he considered strategies for dealing with the growing crisis in March, The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn a Situation Room meeting on March 14 - the same day Trump extended his travel ban to the UK and the Republic of Ireland in a bid to slow the spread of the pandemic - Trump reportedly suggested allowing the US to develop \"herd immunity.\"\n\nThe controversial approach - advocated by some experts at the time - involved letting the disease spread on the assumption that many would develop only mild symptoms and widespread immunity to the disease would begin to build.\n\n\"Why don't we let this wash over the country?\" Trump reportedly asked Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one of the top scientific experts on the president's coronavirus task force.\n\nTwo anonymous sources familiar with the president's remarks confirmed the details of the meeting to the publication.\n\nAccording to the report, Fauci initially didn't understand what Trump meant by the phrase \"wash over.\" When he realized what Trump was saying, he became alarmed and laid out the likely consequences.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" Fauci responded, according to The Post. \"Many people would die.\"\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Deskundigen waarschuwen: er is geen enkel bewijs dat het coronavirus zich minder snel verspreidt met warm weer\n\nTrump was not alone in backing the \"herd immunity\" strategy at the time.\n\nTop government scientific advisers in the UK reportedly initially backed a \"herd immunity\" strategy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson initially resisted the sweeping lockdown measures that were being put in place in other European countries.\n\nIt was only when new projections from scientists at Imperial College in London found that 500,000 could die if the disease was allowed to spread largely unchecked that the government abruptly changed course and introduced compulsory lockdown measures on March 23.\n\nSweden has also resisted introducing sweeping lockdown measures, with government scientists there saying that if introduced too soon, such measures can be counterproductive.\n\nWith the death toll in Sweden rising, such measures could soon be introduced, according to reports. But the government insists no such plans are imminent.\n\nTrump has veered between advocating widespread lockdown measures, and claiming that the measures could do more damage than the disease itself.\n\nBefore extending lockdown measures for a month in early April he had previously considered ignoring the advice of his top scientists and lifting the lockdown in Easter.\n\nIn tweets he has claimed that \"we can't have the cure be worse than the problem\" and that there is an urgent need to mitigate the damage to the US economy.\n\nAccording to The Post, though Trump accepted Fauci's warning in the March meeting, he is continuing to push for an early reopening of the US economy.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_porter@businessinsider.com", "name": "Tom Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

The number is likely even higher, though, since the official count does not include \"probable\" deaths from the pandemic; as many as 200 more per day may be dying from the coronavirus, according to Gothamist.\n\n\"I don't know how many more bodies I can take,\" Patrick Marmo, a funeral home operator based on Brooklyn, previously told Business Insider. He added: \"No one in the New York City area possibly has enough equipment to care for human remains of this magnitude.\"\n\nAja Worthy-Davis, a spokesperson for OCME, directed Business Insider to the website in response to inquiries about the policy change, but did not immediately answer further questions -- including whether \"claiming\" a body requires physical removal within the stipulated six days, or just claiming online via an existing system.\n\nWorthy-Davis told Business Insider on Monday that \"we currently have adequate space for decedents.\" She noted that the city has built tent facilities and parked more than 80 refrigerated trucks and trailers near hospitals to accommodate about 3,600 bodies in refrigerated storage -- a vast expansion of typical storage for 900 bodies. As of Monday, she said, the city had not changed the timeline in which families had to claim bodies.\n\nA day later, however, both situations had changed.\n\nBusiness Insider learned of the shift on Tuesday from two New York-licensed funeral directors whose identities are known to us but who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation from city or state authorities.\n\nOCME held a conference call with funeral directors on Tuesday afternoon to go over the changes and answer questions, the two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAccording to notes taken by a person on the call and reviewed by Business Insider, OCME also said the city's funeral industry would have to pay for its own temporary storage, despite requests from funeral directors for trucks similar to those at hospitals. Moreover, the office recommended that funeral directors store embalmed bodies (which do not decay as readily) for several weeks to accommodate an immediate need to deal with surging fatalities.\n\nHospitals can now also determine time limits for their temporary morgue storage -- perhaps shorter than OCME's six-day limit prior to interment on Hart Island -- according to the meeting notes.\n\nOne funeral director said these changes will strain an already overburdened \"deathcare\" industry, which conveys the bodies of deceased relatives to a final resting place. That system in New York is struggling to find proper storage to accommodate families' requests, and its workers are putting in grueling hours (at significant risk of exposure) to handle the remains of those killed by COVID-19.\n\n\"It makes it look like it's our fault when it's not our fault. It's the city's fault for not helping us,\" the person said of OCME's policy change. \"They're not supporting us.\"\n\nThe funeral director also explained that the process of disinterring remains from Hart Island is complex. Bodies buried there are cataloged in an online database so their location is precisely known, as are their names and other identifying records, to the extent such information is known.\n\nBut it's not easy for families to claim human remains on Hart Island. To retrieve them, the person said, \"they get prisoners to dig the body up, they put it in a special holding cell, then you have to take a special ferry, which only accommodates one funeral director at a time.\"\n\nIf hundreds or even thousands of bodies are buried there in the coming weeks, families might have to wait until long after the pandemic subsides to claim and move loved ones to a final resting place.\n\n\"It's going to take years to get bodies off of Hart Island at that rate,\" the funeral director said.\n\nFor those reasons, the person suggested it'd be preferable to temporarily inter bodies in public parks if the city's refrigerated storage runs out. Such a plan was outlined in a 2016 contingency plan by OCME for a surge in city fatalities.\n\nMark Levine, the chair of the New York city council health committee, said via Twitter on Monday that this scenario was about to happen, but he later walked back the notion.\n\n\"I have spoken to many folks in City gov't today, and received unequivocal assurance that there will be *no* burials in NYC Parks,\" Levine later tweeted. \"All have stated clearly that if temporary interment should be needed it will be done on Hart Island.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news",

to a new study.\n\nThe astonishing projection from Health Management Associates underscores the pandemic's ripple effects from the economy into healthcare. The group said that the number of uninsured Americans could spike to 40 million people, a level unseen since before the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010.\n\nThe study also estimated 23 million Americans could enroll in Medicaid, ensuring many would still receive insurance through other means. But 5 million Americans might still wind up uninsured.\n\nThe economic fallout from the coronavirus caused over 10 million people to file for unemployment benefits in March. That unprecedented surge will likely lead many people to lose their health insurance, given that around half of American workers are covered by their employers.\n\nRead more: Goldman's global equity chief lays out 4 reasons why the stock market will melt down further before it fully captures the coronavirus crisis\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think-tank, recently estimated 3.5 million people lost their health coverage in the last two weeks of March.\n\nThe Trump administration has come under increasing pressure to allow a new enrollment period for the healthcare exchanges under the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare.

Masks should be for the sick, their caretakers, and healthcare workers, the WHO guidance said. Scientists and public-health organizations can't agree on the best face-mask protocol, and the WHO guidelines go against the CDC's face-mask recommendations. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe use of face masks on healthy people during the coronavirus pandemic has been a major point of contention and confusion among scientists and the public.\n\nOn Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that all Americans wear face masks when they are in public.\n\nBut new guidance from the World Health Organization released on Monday says healthy people don't need to wear face masks and that doing so won't provide added protection from the coronavirus.\n\nThere's some evidence that caretakers of infected people can protect their health by wearing masks, the WHO guidance said, but \"there is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (whether medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking, can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.\"\n\nWHO also said community masking could lead to a \"false sense of security\" and cause people to ignore other evidence-based measures like handwashing and self-isolation.\n\nWHO says masks should be saved for healthcare workers, caretakers, and sick people - everyone else should just stay home\n\nFoto: Source: Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nWHO said masks should be reserved for people who have COVID-19 or are in regular close contact with people who have the disease, like caretakers and hospital workers.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Op deze 11 manieren hebben pandemie\u00ebn de loop van de wereldgeschiedenis in de afgelopen 2000 jaar bepaald\n\nPeople with COVID-19 symptoms like a cough or shortness or breath should wear masks even if they haven't tested positive, and they should self-isolate, seek medical advice from home, and practice good hygiene, including handwashing and changing their masks, WHO said.\n\nThe organization also said that healthcare workers should use medical-grade masks, not makeshift cloth masks, when they can after one study showed that medical workers who used cloth masks were at increased risk of infection compared with those who used medical-grade masks.\n\n\"If production of cloth masks for use in health care settings is proposed locally in situations of shortage or stock out, a local authority should assess the proposed PPE according to specific minimum standards and technical specifications,\" the WHO report said.\n\nMasks could slow transmission, but there's room for infection-causing human error\n\nSome health experts believe community masking efforts can't hurt.\n\n\"The argument ... about everybody wearing a mask is not that it will prevent everyone from getting infected - it's that it will slow down transmission in the community a bit,\" Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology and a mask researcher at the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health, previously told Business Insider. \"That's already useful. Just to have even a small effect is useful.\"\n\nAt the same time, Cowling recognized that face masks aren't a perfect public-health tool because they allow room for user error, a point made in the WHO guidance.\n\nWHO officials said healthy people who wear masks might touch their own faces more often than necessary, which could increase their risk for COVID-19.\n\nCowling said user error was a potential reason studies have yet to show community masking is effective at preventing disease spread.\n\n\"Randomized trials don't support a big effect of face masks, but there is the mechanistic plausibility for face masks to work, right? So why not consider it?\" Cowling said. \"If you don't wear the mask properly, and if there's a lot of chances for you to get infected, then the mask may not do a lot of good.\"\n\nBut with much of the world already dealing with severe outbreaks, Cowling said masking efforts for the healthy are unlikely to stop the spread at this point in time.\n\n\"I think it's too late to do a lot for the current epidemic because it's already spread such a lot, and then the cases that you're getting now are people infected two or three weeks ago. And the lockdowns that are in place will hopefully really slow down infections,\" Cowling said. \"Adding masks now I don't think would make a lot of difference to that trajectory.\"\n\nYou can protect yourself without a mask\n\nThe coronavirus is typically spread through tiny droplets that are ejected when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and the droplets land on another person or surface.\n\nScientists are still studying to understand to what extent coronavirus-containing aerosols linger in the air, which would make face-mask wearing more important, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nSo far, evidence suggests that the virus does not linger in the air outside hospital settings, where certain procedures, such as intubating a patients, can aerosolize virus particles.\n\nFor people who isolate at home and practice social distancing when outdoors, aerosols are likely not an issue. Running outdoors alone without wearing a mask, for example, is safe if you feel healthy, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nAs such, WHO said, practicing self-isolation, good hygiene, and social distancing are the best ways for healthy people to stay safe.

inspector general report on hospital shortages", "body": "\"Look, you're a third-rate reporter,\" Trump eventually said to Karl. \"And what you just said is a disgrace, ok?\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump got into a brief verbal spat with ABC News' chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl during a press conference on Monday afternoon, and resorted to calling the reporter someone who \"will never make it.\"\n\nTrump, who was responding to questions about his administration's coronavirus response in the Brady Press Briefing Room in the White House, discussed a Department of Health and Human Services inspector general report warning of severe shortages of supplies for hospitals in the US -- including testing kits and safety gear for physicians.\n\nTrump downplayed the warnings in the report and said the country was doing an \"incredible job\" in addressing testing shortages. Trump claimed that the federal government should not be responsible for medical necessities, such as coronavirus testing, provided in local hospitals.\n\n\"States are supposed to be doing testing. Hospitals are supposed to be doing testing,\" Trump said. \"We're the federal government. We're not supposed to be standing on street corners doing testing. They go to doctors. They go to hospitals.\"\n\nAssistant secretary for health Adm. Brett Giroir offered a few remarks and questioned whether the OIG's release of the report on Monday was prudent.\n\n\"I don't know the inspector general. I don't know that person,\" Giroir said. \"I'll tell you one thing I have a problem with -- If there was such a problem ... why did I find out about the test from them on the news media at 8'oclock this morning?\"\n\n\"But that's a discussion for the future,\" he added.\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General at HHS is led by Christi Grimm, who assumed her position in January 2020. She has decades of experience with the Office of the Inspector General, dating back to 1999.\n\nAs Giroir walked away from the lectern, Trump stepped in: \"How long has that person been in government,\" the president said to the group of reporters.\n\nABC's Jonathan Karl, who recently published a White House tell-all, answered that Grimm \"did serve in the previous administration.\"\n\n\"Oh, you didn't tell me that,\" Trump said sarcastically. \"Oh, I see. You didn't tell me that, John.\"\n\n\"You mean the Obama administration,\" Trump mocked. \"Thank you for telling me that. So there's the typical fake-news deal.\"\n\n\"I told you when she was appointed,\" Karl replied.\n\n\"Look, you're a third-rate reporter,\" Trump said. \"And what you just said is a disgrace, ok?\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, John,\" Trump added, appearing to imitate Karl's voice. \"You will never make it.\"\n\nKarl's new book, \"Front Row at the Trump Show,\" was released in March. In it, Karl reveals the inner machinations of the White House, including Trump's behavior and confrontations with his senior staff.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_choi@businessinsider.com", "name": "David Choi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Karl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Karl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Giroir", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brett Giroir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inspector general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Inspector_General_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office of Inspector General (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third-rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Test_and_Measurement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Test and Measurement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e8bb2bf8427e97b326c4b94?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5665457", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 4376}, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 4376, "relevance": 76}], "totalResults": 841, "page": 1, "count": 25, "pages": 34}}
