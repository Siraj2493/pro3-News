Confirmation that it can move directly between people makes the threat even more severe and increases the risk to other countries.\n\n\"Now we can say it is certain that it is a human-to-human transmission phenomenon,\" said Zhong Nanshan, the scientist the Chinese government has appointed to lead the effort to battle the disease.\n\nAs of Monday, three people in Wuhan had died from the illness, local health authorities said.\n\nThe total number of infections in the country tripled over the weekend, to at least 218. Some scientific estimates have suggested that the true scale of the disease may be an order of magnitude larger than the official confirmed cases.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Albert Heijn heeft openingstijden in veel winkels stilletjes fors verruimd: jacht op omzet en service voor de klant\n\nThe virus, which has pneumonia-like symptoms including fever and difficulty breathing, has already spread to Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, as well as to South Korea, Thailand, and Japan.\n\nThe World Health Organization said it would convene an emergency meeting on Wednesday to determine what kind of international response the outbreak requires.\n\nNeil Ferguson, a public-health expert at Imperial College London, told The New York Times that the danger posed by the virus depended on how \"efficiently\" it spreads from person to person. If the transmission is very effective, it will be able to spread far very quickly. If it is relatively hard for the virus to spread, it will be easier to contain.\n\nIt's unclear how many people have been infected through other humans.\n\nThere are fears that the pace of infection will intensify as hundreds of millions of people travel this week within China and internationally for Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year. More people travel home annually for the New Year holiday than during any other time of year.\n\nHealth authorities in Asia are ramping up measures to spot and contain people who have the virus. A video posted on social media this week showed medics taking passengers' temperatures before a plane could fly out of Wuhan, and various airports have increased their health screenings of people traveling from China.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it would screen incoming passengers from China at airports in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, as are health authorities in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo.\n\nAlex Ma contributed reporting.\n\nRead more: A video of medics in hazmat suits scanning plane passengers for China's mysterious Wuhan virus is stoking fears of a global epidemic People in China will make 3 billion trips in the next 40 days to celebrate Lunar New Year, the world's largest annual human migration A mysterious and deadly virus from China could have infected 35 times more people than official totals, scientists warn A mysterious virus in China is a reminder that the world isn't ready for a pandemic.

between humans.\n\nAuthorities said Tuesday that six people in the city of Wuhan have now died from the virus, according to a report from Reuters.\n\nEarlier it was reported that an 89-year-old man who lived in Wuhan, where the spread started, had become the fourth person to die, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said, Reuters reported.\n\nThe increased death toll comes after authorities on Monday said the virus can spread from one human to another, having previously said that they believed it could only spread from animals to humans.\n\nZhong Nanshan, the scientist the government appointed to lead the fight against the virus, said: \"Now we can say it is certain that it is a human-to-human transmission phenomenon.\"\n\nAnd the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission also said on Monday that at least 15 health workers in Wuhan have been infected with the virus, with one of those workers put in a critical condition.\n\nBoth China's National Health Commission confirmed 291 cases of the virus by the end of Monday. But the number could be higher: When China claimed 45 people had been infected earlier this month, academics from Imperial College London suggested the true number of infected people was somewhere around 1,723.\n\nThe virus, called 2019-nCoV, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, central China, at the end of 2018. Authorities have since confirmed that a few cases have spread to elsewhere in China, and that cases had also been detected away from mainland China: One in Japan, one in South Korea, one in Thailand, and on Tuesday, one was confirmed in Taiwan.\n\nThe virus is a coronavirus - which is one that infects the nose, throat, or sinuses - and has pneumonia-like symptoms. But the strain has never been seen by humans before, and remains mysterious as experts try and study it.\n\nBut authorities believe it originated in a meat and fish market in Wuhan.\n\nThe World Health Organization said it will hold a meeting on Wednesday to decide whether to declare \"a public health emergency of international concern,\" and what recommendations to make. It has previously declared such an emergency for swine flu and Ebola.\n\nFears of the virus' spread are heightened as hundreds of millions of Chinese people prepare to travel to mark the weeks-long

between treating coronavirus patients, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe city, which has about 11 million residents, went under an unprecedented quarantine on Thursday local time amid the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, outbreak. The lockdown has resulted in local hospitals being overwhelmed with patients seeking treatment in the city.\n\nPhotos and videos circulating on social media show people packed into small hallways and doctors treating patients sitting on the floor.\n\nThe Post reported that medical staff are also wearing diapers so they don't have to take off their hazmat suits in case they rip it and can't get a new one due to lack of supplies.\n\nAlong with the shortage of hazmat suits, hospitals are also experiencing a low supply of other protective gear, such as surgical masks and protective goggles, according to ThePaper.com, a Chinese news site, citied by The Post.\n\n\"We know that the protective suit we wear could be the last one we have, and we can't afford to waste anything,\" a Wuhan Union Hospital doctor wrote on Weibo.\n\nThe abundance of patients and overwhelming work has been taking a mental toll on medical staff in the city, as doctors worry of contracting the disease themselves.\n\nBeijing-based therapist Candice Qin told The Post that she talked to a doctor who was infected by a patient, saying the doctor was \"devastated.\" Qin added that the doctor isolated herself in her apartment without telling her parents, feeling a \"sense of helplessness and loneliness.\"\n\n\"I think it is a strain for every doctor and every nurse in Wuhan, both physically and mentally,\" Qin told The Post. \"We know that patients are worried, but we should bear in mind that doctors are just as human as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news",

During that time, an asymptomatic person is also infectious and could spread the coronavirus to others, Ma said, which makes it difficult to stop its spread.\n\nCoronavirus symptoms include nasal congestion, headache, cough, sore throat, and a fever, according to infectious disease expert and University of California San Francisco professor Charles Chiu.\n\n\"At present, the rate of development of the epidemic is accelerating,\" Ma said at the press conference. \"I am afraid that it will continue for some time, and the number of cases may increase.\"\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has killed 56 people and infected more than 2,000, Reuters reported on Sunday.\n\nAlthough officials have quarantined Wuhan and some other neighboring cities, the virus has

could take years to develop, based on our experience trying to fight Zika and Ebola", "body": "Previous infectious disease outbreaks, including for the Ebola and Zika viruses, show the challenges likely to face experimental vaccines for this virus as well.\n\nUS health officials and global organizations are racing to respond to the spread of a deadly virus coming out of Wuhan, China.\n\nOne piece of that effort is enlisting biotechs to begin searching for an effective vaccine.\n\nSeveral companies, including Moderna, Novavax and Inovio, have announced preliminary development plans. But a look back at recent history of other infectious diseases such as Ebola, Zika and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) show these vaccines have faced a challenging and lengthy path.\n\nAnthony Fauci, the longtime director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, estimated the first clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine could begin before this summer, in an interview with the industry publication Biocentury.\n\n\"We likely will be able, unless there are unanticipated roadblocks, to start a Phase 1 trial in about three months,\" he said.\n\nThe first Ebola vaccine was approved last month in the US after roughly two decades of research and four years of clinical testing in thousands of people. The National Institutes of Health is testing a range of vaccine candidates against Zika, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that began spreading widely in 2015.\n\nA 2003 outbreak of SARS led to a similar rush for developing vaccines. More than 15 years later, there is still no approved SARS vaccine. In part, that's because public health efforts helped halt the spread of the virus, leaving little need for a vaccine, according to Christopher Raymond, an analyst at Piper Sandler.\n\nPart of the challenge is finding sources of funding that won't dwindle once an outbreak is over, Maria Elena Bottazzi, a co-director of Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told Business Insider.\n\nBottazzi said the reactionary nature of this funding is one of her biggest concerns for future vaccine development. In the case of her team, they were developing a SARS vaccine when Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, broke out.\n\nThat led to shift in funding to focus on MERS, at the expense of the continued development of their SARS candidate. Now, considering the new coronavirus outbreak, she said that will be the key challenge to watch for as some candidates move into clinical testing.\n\n\"The scientific hurdles are the lower of the hurdles,\" she said. \"Scientifically, we can move quickly. It's the hurdles of how to then mobilize the resources, create the partnerships, and eventually who is going to bring it to the point where we can deliver it to the population.\"\n\nBotazzi estimated that it can take one to three years to develop a vaccine and get it into people's hands.\n\nModerna, a $7 billion biotech based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is one of these biotechs now in the early stages of producing an investigational vaccine. The company's CEO, Stephane Bancel, acknowledged some of the disease's unknowns are likely to create challenges in testing potential vaccines.\n\n\"We do not know the incubation time of the virus - 2 days or 2 weeks. We don't know how long people stay sick - a day or three weeks,\" Bancel said Thursday in an interview with Business Insider. \"That has very big implications for the modeling you do.\"\n\nWriting in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Fauci and two other scientists noted that we're getting better at developing vaccines, thanks in part to innovations from companies like Moderna. They said it took about 20 months to get to early human trials of a vaccine for SARS, but the timeline has since been compressed to the span of a few months.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_dunn@businessinsider.com", "name": "Andrew Dunn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zika fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ebola virus disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cambridge, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JAMA (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incubation period"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 75}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 20}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e29f5dc24306a0d392bfd6a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5457726", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 643}, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 643, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1422610731", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-25", "time": "01:28:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-25T01:28:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-25T01:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.321568638086319, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/china-wuhan-coronavirus-compared-to-sars-2020-1", "title": "Experts say the Wuhan coronavirus is more contagious but less deadly than SARS so far. Here's how the 2 outbreaks compare.", "body": "A coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, has killed 81 people and infected more than 2,800. The virus jumped from animals to people last month, perhaps at a Chinese wet market where live and dead animals were being sold. SARS was also a coronavirus, and that outbreak emerged in a wet market, too. It killed 774 people between 2002 and 2003. According to experts, the Wuhan coronavirus is more contagious but less deadly than SARS. Here's how the two viruses compare. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nEighty-one people have died from a coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, and at least 2,800 people have been infected across 13 countries.\n\nThe virus, which is marked by fevers and pneumonialike symptoms, likely originated in a wet market in Wuhan. Coronaviruses are zoonotic diseases (meaning they can jump from animals to people), so places where shoppers, vendors, and live and dead animals are put in close proximity can be breeding grounds for disease outbreaks.\n\nThe spread of this new virus has conjured a sense of d\u00e9ja vu for some people who remember the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that started in November 2002. That was also a coronavirus, and it also jumped to people from animals in wet markets. SARS emerged in Guangdong and infected 8,098 people over the course of eight months, killing 774. Patients experienced fevers, headaches, and a type of deadly pneumonia that could cause respiratory failure.\n\nExperts called SARS \"the first pandemic of the 21st century,\" since it spread across 29 countries. The disease hasn't been seen in humans since July 2003.\n\nSo far, experts say, concerns that the Wuhan coronavirus is the next SARS are overblown. The two virus' symptoms and origins may be comparable, but their severity is not.\n\nThe new coronavirus appears to be less severe than the SARS, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Friday. It might be more contagious, however, given that this outbreak is spreading faster than SARS did.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Blik op je Geld: lage vaste prijs voor gas en stroom, \u20ac2.250 per maand rijker met je huis\n\nMa Xiaowei, minister of China's National Health Commission, said people can transmit the coronavirus to one another during its 14-day incubation period, the South China Morning Post reported. By comparison, SARS' average incubation period was seven days.\n\nThe illness can also jump between people before patients show symptoms, which makes it challenging for authorities to control the virus' spread.\n\n\"An initial first impression is that this is significantly milder than SARS. That's reassuring,\" Eric Toner, a senior scientist at John Hopkins University, told Business Insider. \"On the other hand, it may be more transmissible than SARS, at least in the community setting.\"\n\nHere are some of the crucial differences between this outbreak and the SARS one 17 years ago.\n\nThe first report of the Wuhan coronavirus came on December 31, 2019. Wuhan is a city of 11 million people in the central province of Hubei, China.\n\nFoto: sourceGoogle Maps/Business Insider\n\nSARS originated in the Guangdong province in southeastern China, near Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), 50% of people impacted by SARS were age 65 or older, while the other half of infected patients varied widely in age.\n\nFoto: A security guard wears a mask at Amoy Gardens housing estate in Kowloon bay, Hong Kong, where a block was quarantined to protect against a SARS outbreak, April 1, 2003.sourcePETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSo far, experts report that the median age of those who have died from the Wuhan coronavirus is around 75. Many of those individuals had other health issues like high blood pressure, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease.\n\nAdrian Hyzler, chief medical officer at Healix International, told Business Insider that children, elderly people, pregnant women, and those who are immuno-compromised are more susceptible to the coronavirus' most severe complications.\n\nSARS didn't spread as fast in its first three weeks as the new coronavirus has, according to the WHO.\n\nFoto: A nurse wearing protective gear walks outside a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) clinic in suburban Toronto, 2003.sourceReuters\n\nIt took almost five months for SARS to spread to 3,000 people. The Wuhan coronavirus has infected almost 3,000 people in just 28 days.\n\nAccording to a study by Chinese researchers in Hong Kong, one person with the new coronavirus could pass it on to three to five others.\n\nFoto: Health Officials in hazmat suits wait at the gate to check body temperatures of passengers arriving from the city of Wuhan on January 22, 2020, at the airport in Beijing, China.sourceEmily Wang/AP\n\nThe authors of the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, said their results suggest the coronavirus has the potential to spread globally.\n\nNeil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, told The Guardian on Sunday that there may be as many as 100,000 cases already in China.\n\nThe new coronavirus' fatality rate has not yet been determined with accuracy, but it seems to be around 3% so far. SARS was more deadly, with a fatality rate of 9.6%.\n\nFoto: A medical worker attends to a patient in the intensive care unit at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in China, January 24, 2020. This photo was released by China's Xinhua News Agency.sourceAssociated Press\n\nOne reason SARS spread to so many places around the world is that Chinese authorities initially attempted to hide the outbreak from the World Health Organization.\n\nThe Chinese government didn't inform the WHO about SARS until February 14, 2003 -- 88 days after the first reported case.\n\nFoto: A doctor checks equipment at a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) screening room at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia in 2003.sourceAHMAD YUSNI / AFP) (Photo by AHMAD YUSNI/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAccording to The Sydney Morning Herald, doctors in Beijing were ordered by authorities to hide SARS patients from WHO officials during inspections.\n\nDuring the initial stages of that outbreak, the Chinese government also concealed information from the public, which exacerbated the spread of disease.\n\nLiu Heng, an adviser to China's cabinet, told Reuters that this time around, China announced the outbreak to the public much more immediately.\n\nFoto: A worker monitors display screens for infrared thermometers as part of traveler screenings at Hankou Railway Station in Wuhan, China, January 21, 2020.sourceAssociated Press\n\n\"We are doing much better now ... We are paying greater attention to preventing the epidemic,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nChinese public-health experts also worked to quickly share the Wuhan coronavirus' genetic information with researchers around the globe.\n\nFoto: An image of X-rays of SARS patients' lungs.sourceAgence France Presse\n\n\"The speed with which this virus has been identified is a testament to changes in public health in China since SARS and strong global coordination through the WHO,\" Jeremy Farrar, an infectious-diseases specialist who worked on combating SARS, told Reuters.\n\nBy contrast, it took four months for SARS' genome to be published.\n\nBy sharing information about the new coronavirus genome, scientists have been able to work together to analyze how the illness is spreading and mutating.\n\nFoto: A staff member moves bio-waste containers past the entrance of the Wuhan Medical Treatment Center in Wuhan, China, where some people infected with a coronavirus were being treated on January 22, 2020.sourceDake Kang/AP\n\nThat work also helps experts track down which animal the coronavirus jumped from.\n\nIn the case of SARS, and probably this coronavirus outbreak too, bats were the original hosts. They then infected other animals via their poop or saliva, and the unwitting intermediaries transmitted the virus to humans.\n\nFoto: A greater horseshoe bat, a relative of the Rhinolophis sinicus bat species from China that was the origin of the SARS virus.sourceDe Agostini/Getty\n\n\"Bats and birds are considered reservoir species for viruses with pandemic potential,\" Bart Haagmans, a virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands, told Business Insider.\n\nSARS jumped from bats to weasel-like mammals called masked palm civets, then to humans.\n\nFoto: An Asian palm civet in a cage at Kopi luwak farm and plantation in Ubud District, Bali, Indonesia, on November 20, 2018.sourceOleksandr Rupeta/NurPhoto/Getty\n\nAccording to a group of scientists who edit the Journal of Medical Virology, the culprit spreading the Wuhan coronavirus could be the Chinese cobra, but that has yet to be confirmed.\n\nAn analysis showed that the genetic building blocks of the Wuhan coronavirus closely resemble that of snakes.\n\nResearchers traced SARS to a population of horseshoe bats in China's Yunnan province. These bats lived in a cave just 1.1 kilometer from the nearest village.\n\nHere are five viruses that most likely came from bats and how the outbreaks compare.\n\nFoto: sourceShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nAnother difference between the SARS outbreak and this new coronavirus outbreak is that Chinese authorities quickly instituted travel lock-downs this time.\n\nFoto: A policeman uses a digital thermometer to take a driver's temperature at a checkpoint at a highway toll gate in Wuhan, China on January 23, 2020.sourceChinatopix/AP\n\nAuthorities quarantined Wuhan on Thursday, halting all public transportation, including city buses, trains, and ferries. The order prevents any buses or trains from coming into or leaving the city and grounds all planes at the Wuhan airport.\n\nThe city of Huanggang went into lockdown on Thursday as well, as authorities closed subway and train stations. By the following day, 10 additional cities - Chibi, Enshi, Ezhou, Huangshi, Suizhou, Qianjjiang, Xianning, Xiantao, Yichang, and Zhijiang - had followed suit with their own travel restrictions.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said efforts to quarantine cities could help Chinese authorities control the virus' spread and \"minimize the chances of this outbreak spreading internationally.\"\n\nFoto: A girl wearing a face mask at Beijing's central railway station, January 2020.sourceKevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\n\"What they're doing is a very, very strong measure, and with full commitment,\" Ghebreyesus said in press conference on January 22.\n\nThese restrictions affect at least 33 million people in China.\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak, it took officials at least four months to institute any quarantine measures.\n\nFoto: A militia member uses a digital thermometer to take a driver's temperature at a checkpoint at a highway toll gate in Wuhan, China, January 23, 2020.sourceAssociated Press\n\nAnthony Fauci, a disease expert at the National Institutes of Health, told CNBC that he thinks China is \"doing much better this time.\"\n\nNeither SARS nor the Wuhan coronavirus has a vaccine.\n\nFoto: A nurse fills a syringe with a vaccine before administering an injection at a children's clinic in Kiev, Ukraine.sourceReuters\n\n\"If Wuhan were to explode, a vaccine best-case scenario is three-quarters of a year, if not longer,\" Vincent Munster, a virologist at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, told Business Insider.\n\nSeveral companies, including Moderna, Novavax, and Inovio, have announced preliminary vaccine development plans. But vaccine development has historically been an arduous, multi-year process (the Ebola vaccine took 20 years to make). None of the companies provided expected timelines to get vaccines to market.\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus, unlike SARS, isn't considered a pandemic.\n\nFoto: Passengers wear protective face masks at the departure hall of the high speed train station in Hong Kong, Thursday, Jan. 23, 2020.sourceAP Photo/Kin Cheung\n\nThe WHO has not declared it a global public-health emergency, either.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aylin_woodward@businessinsider.com", "name": "Aylin Woodward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoonosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guangdong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangdong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_failure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory failure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 64}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e2b98f15bc79c227908e0d3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5454192", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 602}, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 602, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1420711967", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-01-23", "time": "13:33:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-23T13:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-23T13:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/new-coronavirus-in-china-might-have-jumped-people-from-snakes-2020-1", "title": "The new coronavirus in China might have jumped to people from snakes", "body": "Snakes -- the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra -- may be the original source of the newly discovered coronavirus that has triggered an outbreak of a deadly infectious respiratory illness in China this winter.\n\nThe illness was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, a major city in central China, and has been rapidly spreading. Since then, sick travelers from Wuhan have infected people in China and other countries, including the United States.\n\nUsing samples of the virus isolated from patients, scientists in China have determined the genetic code of the virus and used microscopes to photograph it. The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is a new coronavirus. It's in the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV.\n\nWe are virologists and journal editors and are closely following this outbreak because there are many questions that need to be answered to curb the spread of this public health threat.\n\nThe name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope.\n\nCoronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. Though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans.\n\nThis new 2019-nCoV causes similar symptoms to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection. A better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-nCoV, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted, and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease.\n\nBoth SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans.\n\nNow these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. Field studies have revealed that the original source of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is the bat, and that the masked palm civets (a mammal native to Asia and Africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans.\n\nIn the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalized were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs, and reptiles. However, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market.\n\nThe hypothesis that the 2019-nCoV jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the Journal of Medical Virology. The scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-nCoV and all other known coronaviruses.\n\nThe study of the genetic code of 2019-nCoV reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronavirus samples from China, initially suggesting that, like SARS and MERS, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-nCoV. The authors further found that the DNA coding sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, which forms the \"crown\" of the virus particle that recognizes the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people.\n\nBut when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-nCoV, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes.\n\nThe researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favored by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats, and humans. Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-nCoV are most similar to those used in snakes.\n\nSnakes often hunt for bats in wild. Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species -- bats -- to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery.\n\nThe authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. Searching for the 2019-nCoV sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. However, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus' source animal.\n\nSampling DNA from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. Nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols.\n\nThe 2019-nCoV outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shou_jiang_gao@businessinsider.com",

There are fears it could happen again.", "body": "A mysterious new virus is sweeping through parts of Asia, infecting more than 200 people since the virus was first detected in Wuhan, China in December.\n\nThe new illness is believed to have originated from a seafood market in Wuhan, a densely populated central Chinese city home to around 11 million people. It has been dubbed the Wuhan virus, or the 2019-nCoV, and is considered to a coronavirus, which causes cold-like symptoms and is considered \"zoonotic\" and can be transmitted between animals and humans.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), signs of coronavirus infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and even death.\n\nThe virus is considered to be a \"novel coronavirus\" because it is a new strain that has not previously been identified in humans. There are currently no vaccinations for the disease, although WHO has published interim guidelines for all countries on how they can prepare for this virus, including monitoring sick people, treating and quarantining patients, and communicating with the public about the spread of infection.\n\nAs of Tuesday, at least four people in Wuhan have died from the virus, according to local authorities. The virus has also spread to other Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shenzhen, as well as South Korea, Thailand, and Japan. Several as-of-yet unconfirmed cases have also been reported in the UK and Australia.\n\nBy late Monday, 218 people have been infected in China, according to Reuters. Of that number, 198 people have been infected in Wuhan alone, which is triple the number of cases disclosed the previous day by Chinese authorities. On Tuesday, Wuhan health authorities said that dozens of patients remain in hospital with the virus, some critically ill and all under quarantine.\n\nBut China's handling of 2003's SARS epidemic has sparked concerns among observers of another possible global pandemic and state-sanctioned cover-up.\n\nFears of another global epidemic stem from China's handling of the deadly outbreak of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in the early 2000s.\n\nExperts have noted that there are similarities between the Wuhan virus and the SARS Virus, which reached epidemic proportions between November 2002 and July 2003. The epidemic caused 8,098 cases of the disease and resulted in 774 deaths across at least 30 countries before it was declared contained.\n\nThe outbreak of the illness was traced to China's Guangdong Province and was genetically traced to have spread through bats.\n\nDuring the initial stages of the outbreak, the Chinese government concealed information from the public, limiting mitigation efforts and exacerbating the spread of disease. The country also had no government agencies in place at the time to deal with a public health emergency.\n\nThe government did not inform the World Health Organization of the outbreak until February 2003, allowing the disease to flourish.\n\nAccording to The Sydney Morning Herald, doctors in Beijing were ordered by authorities to hide SARS patients from WHO officials during inspections.\n\nThe tight-lipped response from the Chinese government on the disease was both a political and an economic move, meant to reduce public panic and keep the status quo within the country. Taiwanese legislators even accused China of unleashing the virus as part of a biological warfare campaign, though no conclusive evidence has been found, according to Reuters.\n\nA Chinese doctor named Jiang Yanyong eventually exposed China's attempted cover-up of the disease, earning him a human rights award, that he was barred from traveling to collect in the US. He was also reportedly taken into Chinese military custody before being released in 2014.\n\nChina finally apologized in 2003 for its slow reporting of the outbreak and promised to establish a national medical emergency mechanism.\n\nOn Sunday, China's National Health Commission said in its first public statement on the outbreak that an outbreak of the disease is \"still preventable and controllable.\"\n\nOn Monday, the health body was forced to admit that the disease was able to spread from person-to-person, and cases of infection were reported by people who never stepped foot in Wuhan.\n\n\"Currently, it can be said it is affirmative that there is the phenomenon of human-to-human transmission,\" Zhong Nanshan, a scientist at the National Health Commission, said in an interview on Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. He added that the spread of the deadly infection was \"climbing\" though he said the \"death rate at the moment is not so representative.\"\n\nChinese leaders have also spoken out on the disease, promising to share pertinent information with the public quickly.\n\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday pledged that the government would \"adhere to openness and transparency\" and would \"release authoritative information\" on the virus \"in a unified manner.\"\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping also gave a statement on the health crisis, saying it was necessary to \"release information on the epidemic in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation.\"\n\nDespite this, observers are still skeptical about China's commitment to speaking the truth as China has also been known to distort data and enforce strict censorship in reference to information it shares with the public.\n\nReuters' China correspondent Cate Cadell tweeted that several people she had spoken to reported being tracked by Chinese authorities for posting information about sick relatives or friends on social media, or for speaking to members of the press.\n\nAccording to Reuters, users of the microblogging platform Weibo have complained about a lack of access to clear guidance from the government on preventing the spread of disease.\n\nScientists at the Imperial College London working in collaboration with WHO suggest the actual number of people infected by the virus may be anywhere between 996 and 2,298, which are figures significantly higher than that released by the Chinese government so far.\n\nThere are also concerns that China is downplaying the severity of the virus ahead of China's Lunar New Year holiday, often described as the \"largest human migration in the world,\" which could accelerate the crisis rapidly as millions prepare to travel to the country.\n\nThe world is closely watching the Chinese government as it responds to the spread of its newest coronavirus in the wake of its SARS crisis.\n\nExperts have noted that China has learned much from the SARS crisis, including the need for coordinated response.\n\nBut news about the virus has spread across social media, raising pressure on the Chinese government to increase transparency.\n\nOn Sunday, journalist David Paulk posted a video of medics in hazmat suits scanning dozens of plane passengers for the symptoms of the virus, stoking fears of a global epidemic.\n\nThree US airports have also begun screening passengers for the disease, as have airports in Singapore and Hong Kong, according to the BBC.\n\n\"The government seems to have learned that in an era of the Internet and cell phones, a complete information blackout is not only impossible but also counterproductive,\" Yanzhong Huang, who published a report on the SARS epidemic and its aftermath in China, wrote in 2004.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"},

"title": "Urban planners say China's effort to quarantine 35 million people could help contain the coronavirus outbreak  --  but it's impossible to seal off a city", "body": "An urban planner said there's no way to completely seal off a city, but shutting down transportation significantly reduces the chances that people will leave.\n\nMost urban planners don't design a city with the idea of sealing it off. Many advocate for the opposite: making cities as free-flowing as possible to encourage tourism and attract workers.\n\nBut last week, officials in Wuhan, China -- the 11-million-person city where a fast-growing coronavirus outbreak started -- put the city under quarantine.\n\n\"If you live in cities, your movement can be controlled through public transport,\" Fei Chen, an urban-design lecturer at the University of Liverpool, told Business Insider. \"Wuhan has an international airport. It has highways and railways. So if you close all of them, then you basically cut off the means for people to get out.\"\n\nThat is exactly what officials did. All forms of public transportation were halted, including buses, metros, and ferries. No trains or airplanes are coming in or out of the city, and roadblocks were installed to deter private cars from leaving.\n\nWuhan residents were told not to leave, barring special circumstances.\n\nThe virus, which scientists call 2019-nCoV, has killed 81 people and infected nearly 2,800. It has spread to 13 other countries: France, Australia, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore, Nepal, Malaysia, Canada, and the US. The outbreak might have originated at a wet market in Wuhan that sold live animals such as chickens, pigs, snakes, and civets. The market was shuttered on January 1.\n\nChen said there's no way to completely seal off a city, however.\n\nThe first coronavirus case was recorded in Wuhan on December 31. The family of viruses is also responsible for pneumonia, the common cold, and SARS, which affected about 8,000 people and killed 774 in China between 2002 and 2003.\n\nThe new coronavirus causes fever, chills, coughing, sneezing, and a sore throat. It appears to spread person-to-person more easily and quickly than SARS, but it is far less deadly so far.\n\nAs a major Chinese transportation center, Wuhan's high-speed rail lines connect to Shanghai and Guangzhou (cities with populations of 24 million and 13 million people, respectively). The city's Tianhe International Airport also serves more than 20 million passengers annually.\n\n\"Chinese cities currently are really connected, especially regionally,\" Chen said. \"It's really easy to travel from one city to another.\"\n\nMany of Wuhan's neighboring cities have been closed off as well. As of Friday, at least 12 additional cities had imposed their own travel restrictions. The restrictions so far affect an estimated 35 million people in the Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.\n\n\"It's a wise thing to do because it's Chinese New Year,\" Chen said last week. \"Chinese people, we have this custom to go back home to spend time with family, and there's a big population movement.\"\n\nPrior to the outbreak, hundreds of millions of people were expected to travel to and within China for the Lunar New Year celebration, which began on Saturday and lasts until February 8.\n\nNow, Chen said, it's almost impossible to leave Wuhan.\n\n\"The chance you can get out of Hubei province is quite slim,\" she said. \"If you want to go out of the province, normally it's through the major highways and high-speed railways.\"\n\nMany of China's newly constructed highway networks, she added, have tolls that are patrolled under normal circumstances, making it easy to monitor the entry and exit of cars.\n\nChen said it could be more difficult to quarantine small towns and villages that don't rely on major transportation systems. These towns connect to major cities through road networks.\n\nThat means the quarantine isn't foolproof.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it's 100% effective, but to a very large extent they have controlled or kept people within the region,\" Chen said.\n\nQuarantines are probably easier to enforce in China, she added, because of the nation's centralized political system and state institutions.\n\n\"All the police forces obey those higher orders,\" Chen said. \"The public transport is public, so it's controlled by the government. If you compare with the UK, where public transport is sometimes owned by private companies, it's much more difficult to do something like this.\"\n\nKristin Stapleton, an urban historian who studies Chinese history at the University of Buffalo, told Business Insider she thinks \"many people are probably staying put out of fear, both of the coronavirus and of the high-tech community surveillance that has become pervasive in Chinese cities.\"\n\nChen said some urban planners are starting to discuss what it would take to seal off a city -- but they have climate change in mind, not a potential virus.\n\n\"I wouldn't say we have exactly thought about how to close down a whole city, because that's really rare,\" she said. \"But we're talking about how a city could be resilient to natural disasters like flooding and earthquakes and sea level-rise.\"\n\nStill, she said, urban planners would be wise to consider the services that citizens might need if their city were on lockdown because of a disaster -- such as healthcare clinics for individual neighborhoods so people don't have to travel far from their homes for treatment.\n\nDoctors in Wuhan are reporting that there aren't enough resources to treat patients, and people are waiting for hours in line to receive medical care. Thus far, test kits have been reserved for patients with the most severe symptoms, so diagnoses can be delayed.\n\nThe city is also rushing to build a brand-new hospital with 1,000 beds in just six days.\n\n\"What really should be considered in urban planning is how you could provide the best, most efficient healthcare to residents,\" Chen said. \"I don't think a quarantine is really something we should make a priority when we plan a city.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aria_bendix@businessinsider.com",

people are fighting over supplies. Soon they may just be fighting.\"\n\nPeople left in the Chinese city of Wuhan are stockpiling food and fuel, and avoiding the streets, after authorities sealed off the city of 11 million people to try and prevent the spread of a mysterious coronavirus that has killed at least 17 people.\n\nThe 2019-nCoV virus, first recorded in December 2019, has spread from the city to other parts of China, infecting 571 people in the country as of Thursday morning, as well as in other countries.\n\nAuthorities closed off transport links to the city, which is a major travel hub, on Thursday morning. They are effectively sealing the city off in an attempt to stop a further spread during the Chinese New Year holiday when hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel.\n\nEveryone left in the city are now scrambling to stockpile essential goods, with residents reporting massive lines and skyrocketed prices.\n\nSome residents posted on social media complaining of surging prices for goods, empty shelves, and long lines to buy things, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Everyone is on a buying spree,\" wrote one user on microblogging site Weibo, accompanying his post with an image of a long line at a checkout aisle, according to Reuters.\n\nSeveral other residents told the news agency that people were rushing to stockpile supplies, leaving supermarket shelves empty of things like meat, vegetables and instant noodles.\n\nAnd The Guardian reported that one another Weibo user posted an image of the food they bought and wrote: \"No more going out ... so I won't get sick. Hope Wuhan can get some support soon.\"\n\nPetrol stations were \"overwhelmed,\" with people spreading false rumors that fuel reserves had run out, The Guardian added. A resident told Reuters that he had to line up for an hour to fill up his car.\n\nLocal pharmacies have also run out of face masks, which residents are now being required to wear, The Guardian reported.\n\nApartment buildings were also being disinfected, with many residents saying they plan leaving the house as little as possible, The Guardian reported.\n\nOne teacher told the outlet: \"When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little too late now. The government's measures are not enough.\"\n\nShe said she had not left her house since January 19. \"Infected people could be right beside you and you wouldn't know. That is what is scarier,\" she said.\n\nThe stockpiling has led to concerns that it could lead to further social unrest.\n\nOne Wuhan resident wrote on Weibo, according to The Guardian: \"The government needs to address this.

It has not been tried before as a public health measure, so we cannot at this stage say it will or will not work,\" he said.\n\n\"Such a decision obviously has social and economic impacts that are considerable,\" he added.\n\nThe travel restrictions were extended to two other cities near Wuhan - Huanggang and Ezhou - on Thursday, effectively sealing off a total of 19 million people in China.\n\nThe virus, which has pneumonia-like symptoms, is a new one that has not been seen by humans before.

early May.\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus, which scientists believe jumped from a snake to a human, has infected more than 600 people across nine countries and killed 18. The outbreak prompted five cities in China to halt all transportation. Cases have been reported in eight other countries.\n\nBut we haven't yet seen the worst of this new illness, a Chinese virologist says.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak could reach 10 times the scale of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Guan Yi told Chinese news outlet Caixin. Guan helped identify the SARS virus, which was also in the coronavirus family. It affected more than 8,000 people and killed 774. The new coronavirus, however, appears to be far less deadly than SARS.\n\nThe reason Guan thinks this outbreak could be worse than SARS is that Chinese authorities missed the \"golden time\" to halt the spread of this coronavirus, he said. People started their Lunar New Year trips - the country's busiest travel period - before the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak started, was put on lockdown. Guan estimated the incubation period of the coronavirus to be about eight days.\n\n\"I don't think the local government has done what it should do. They haven't even been handing out quarantine guides to people who were leaving the city,\" Guan, who quarantined himself after visiting Wuhan, told Caixin.\n\nA now-deleted post from Wuhan Railway said 300,000 people traveled by train out of Wuhan on January 15, the Washington Post reported.\n\nGuan also said that when the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was washed clean - that's where experts think the outbreak originated - critical evidence got lost.\n\nEric Toner, a scientist at Johns Hopkins University, previously told Business Insider that although this coronavirus seems to be significantly milder than SARS, \"it may be more transmissible than SARS, at least in the community setting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a Chinese professor who teaches agricultural economics in Germany, issued a different - but equally dire - warning.\n\nThe virus outbreak is expected to peak 90 days after its start, Yu Xiaohua told the South China Morning Post. That would be in March. Its effects could be felt into early May, Yu wrote on the Chinese social-media platform Weibo.\n\nHis prediction was based on a mathematical model that used data from the SARS outbreak, Yu said. However, he told the 21st Century Business Herald, a Chinese newspaper, that the forecast doesn't take into account the government's ongoing attempts to limit the spread of the virus, including quarantining multiple cities.\n\nOutside of China, cases of coronavirus have been reported in the US, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia, as well as the cities of Macau and Hong Kong.\n\nVideos are emerging of patients being transported in metal boxes or plastic tubes to limit the spread of the virus. The US patient, meanwhile, is being treated in a hospital in Everett, Washington, where doctors are using a robot equipped with a camera, microphone, and stethoscope to minimize their own contact with the virus.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rhea_mahbubani@businessinsider.com", "name": "Rhea Mahbubani", "type":

a coronavirus pandemic 3 months ago. Their simulation showed it could kill 65 million people.", "body": "In a simulated scenario, his organization predicted that 65 million people could die within 18 months.\n\nEric Toner, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, wasn't shocked when news of a mysterious coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, surfaced in early January.\n\nLess than three months prior, Toner had staged a simulation of a global pandemic involving a coronavirus.\n\nCoronaviruses typically affect the respiratory tract and can lead to illnesses like pneumonia or the common cold. A coronavirus was also responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in China, which affected around 8,000 people and killed 774 from 2002 to 2003.\n\n\"I have thought for a long time that the most likely virus that might cause a new pandemic would be a coronavirus,\" Toner said.\n\nThe outbreak in Wuhan isn't currently considered a pandemic, but it has spread to Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia. The US reported its first case on Tuesday: a man in his 30s living in Washington's Snohomish County, north of Seattle.\n\nSo far, the virus has killed 17 people and infected more than 630.\n\n\"We don't yet know how contagious it is. We know that it is being spread person to person, but we don't know to what extent,\" Toner said. \"An initial first impression is that this is significantly milder than SARS. So that's reassuring. On the other hand, it may be more transmissible than SARS, at least in the community setting.\"\n\nToner's simulation of a hypothetical deadly coronavirus pandemic suggested that after six months, nearly every country in the world would have cases of the virus. Within 18 months, 65 million people could die.\n\nToner's simulation imagined a fictional virus called CAPS. The analysis, done as part of a collaboration with the World Economic Forum and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, looked at what would happen if a pandemic originated among Brazil's pig farms. (The Wuhan virus, by contrast, originated in a seafood market that sold live animals.)\n\nThe virus in Toner's simulation would be resistant to any modern vaccine. It would be deadlier than SARS, but about as easy to catch as the flu.\n\nThe pretend outbreak started small: Farmers began coming down with symptoms that resembled the flu or pneumonia. From there, the virus spread to crowded and impoverished urban neighborhoods in South America.\n\nFlights were canceled and travel bookings dipped by 45%. People disseminated false information on social media.\n\nAfter six months, the virus had spread around the globe. A year later, it had killed 65 million people.\n\nThe pandemic virus that caused the Spanish flu of 1918, by contrast, claimed 50 million lives.\n\nToner's simulated pandemic also triggered a global financial crisis: Stock markets fell by between 20% and 40% and global GDP plunged by 11%.\n\n\"The point that we tried to make in our exercise back in October is that it isn't just about the health consequences,\" Toner said. \"It's about the consequences on economies and societies.\"\n\nHe added the Wuhan coronavirus could also have significant economic effects if the total number of cases hits the thousands.\n\nOn Friday, Hong Kong's stock market fell by as much as 2.8%. The drop was led by the tourism and transportation sectors, including airlines, tour agencies, hotels, restaurants, and theme parks.\n\nIn the CAPS simulation, scientists were unable to develop a vaccine in time to stop a pandemic. That's a realistic assumption: Even real-life coronaviruses like SARS or MERS (a virus that has killed more than 840 people from 2012 to 2019) still don't have vaccines.\n\n\"If we could make it so that we could have a vaccine within months rather than years or decades, that would be a game changer,\" Toner said. \"But it's not just the identification of potential vaccines. We need to think even more about how they are manufactured on a global scale and distributed and administered to people.\"\n\nIf scientists don't find a way to develop vaccines quicker, he added, dangerous outbreaks will continue to spread. That's because cities are becoming more crowded and humans are encroaching on spaces usually reserved for wildlife, which creates a breeding ground for infectious diseases.\n\n\"It's part of the world we live in now,\" Toner said. \"We're in an age of epidemics.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":
