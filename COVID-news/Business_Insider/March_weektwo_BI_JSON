If it passes, the president has said he will sign the bill into law.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi initially announced that a deal had been reached between Democrats and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Friday evening. Shortly after, Trump tweeted that he supported the bill, saying he was looking \"forward to signing the final Bill, ASAP!\"\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act seeks to expand paid sick leave and other programs during the pandemic. Washington has dramatically escalated its response this week to the respiratory illness COVID-19, which has sickened more than 1,200 throughout the US.\n\nThe bill includes free coronavirus testing, paid leave (including sick leave) protections for frontline workers, enhanced unemployment insurance, food security measures, and increased Medicaid funding.\n\n\"The coronavirus crisis presents a grave and accelerating threat to public health and to the economic security and well-being of the American people,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"As members of Congress, we have a solemn and urgent responsibility to take strong, serious action to confront and control this crisis and to put Families First and stimulate the economy.\"\n\nThe legislation was meant to build on an $8 billion coronavirus response package, which was approved with overwhelming bipartisan support within a matter of days last week. It called to expand unemployment insurance and support for small businesses, potentially through loans and tax deferrals.\n\nBut Republican leaders initially objected to certain aspects of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act that was proposed by Democrats a day earlier, prompting two days of behind-the-scenes negotiations between Pelosi and Mnuchin.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs studied every bear market in stocks since 1835 -- and concluded that 3 red flags make this coronavirus-driven one unlike any other in history\n\nKey issues included how a paid sick leave mandate would be carried out, with Republicans arguing that the Social Security Administration would take six months to send out checks. Some also pushed for amendments that would set an end date for the legislation and offer certain businesses exemptions.\n\nAs concerns about the economy rose rapidly without signs of progress on the bill Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the upper chamber would no longer take a recess that had been scheduled for next week.\n\n\"I hope Congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong,\" McConnell said.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Trump announced the Treasury Department would defer tax payments for certain people and businesses in a move that he said would add $200 billion of liquidity to the economy. But other proposals from the White House have fallen flat on Capitol Hill, such as a payroll-tax cut that critics said would be ineffective and expensive.\n\nPolicy responses from Washington have done little to ease fears about growth in the largest economy, which a growing number of experts have forecast could contract this year. Wall Street suffered its worst day since the 1987 stock-market crash on Thursday, even as the Federal Reserve stepped in with $1.5 trillion worth of short-term loans to banks.", "source": {"uri":

Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania are also not part of it.\n\nThough the UK and Ireland were originally exempt from the temporary travel ban, the Trump administration on Saturday announced the restrictions were being extended to include both countries. Vice President Mike Pence said the travel restrictions on the UK and Ireland would take effect on Monday at midnight. This brings the total number of European countries affected by the travel restrictions to 28.\n\nOver 1,100 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK as of Saturday.

the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall,\" Diamond told NPR, according to a transcript.\n\nUS health authorities have tested about 12,000 people for the disease since January, while authorities in South Korea are testing as many as 10,000 suspected cases a day.\n\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar had also \"not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen\" in the outbreak, Diamond told NPR.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, a HHS spokesperson directed Business Insider to a tweet from NPR, which clarified that it was Trump and not Azar who did not push for more testing facilities.\n\nIn the early weeks of the outbreak one of Trump's key concerns, according to multiple reports, was how negative statements from health officials on the outbreak may impact the financial markets. The president has long regarded the health of the markets as a barometer for the strength of his presidency.\n\nTrump's public statements have sought to project an optimistic picture downplaying the threat of the virus, which have come at odds with the somber warnings of other health officials.\n\n\"It goes away,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday. \"It's going away. We want it to go away with very, very few deaths.\"\n\nAt a White House briefing last week he was corrected by Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, after falsely claiming that a vaccine for the virus would soon be available.\n\nThere has been widespread confusion about the availability of coronavirus test kits in the country, and the Trump administration has faced mounting criticism over allegations it failed to ensure that adequate testing facilities were in place.\n\nLast week Trump claimed that anyone who wants a test can get one, but there have been reports from across the country of the difficulty to procure a kit.\n\nOn Tuesday, Fauci told Congress that US testing facilities were inadequate.\n\n\"The system is not really geared to what we need right now ... let's admit it,\" Dr Fauci said.\n\nIn an early Friday morning tweet Trump sought to shift blame for the lack of tests available to failings at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and during former President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped,\" tweeted Trump. \"President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.\"\n\n\"Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis.

She also said that eventually \"many people in the United States\" will be exposed to the virus and that \"there's a good chance many will become sick.\" For now, she said, people over 60 should stock up on food, medication, and other necessities so they can avoid needing to venture out too much. Caretakers and family members should help older people prepare, and develop a plan for what they'll do if either they or the person they're caring for gets sick. While people over 60 are at a greater risk of getting ill than younger folks, it's important for people to understand that risk increases with age, making people in their 80s and 90s at the highest risk of all, especially if they have chronic health conditions too.

Zo doe je dat op een veilige manier als je nu toe wilt slaan\n\nMessonnier said it's important for family members and neighbors to look out for folks who are in these higher-risk categories by, for example, making sure you're familiar with their medications and helping them get necessary food and supplies.\n\nThe goal of stocking up, she emphasized, is so more vulnerable people \"can minimize trips to the store\" and \"stay close to home.\"\n\nFinally, she said, caretakers should make a plan in case their loved ones do get sick or if they become ill themselves, like having backup caretakers.\n\n\"Everyone has a role to play in helping to protect our family members, friends, colleagues, and neighbors who are at most risk,\" she said. Even if the recommendations are unpopular or difficult, she added, \"at CDC, our No. 1 priority is the health and safety of the American people.\"\n\nMessonnier emphasized that risk increases with age\n\nThe \"over-60\" marker is not a black-and-white cutoff separating people who aren't at risk from those who are.\n\n\"I really think it's important for the American public to understand the risk,\" Messonnier said. \"We use these broad categories of over 60 or over 65, but the data really says that as you get older the risk goes up.\"\n\nIn other words, people over 80 or even 90 are at the greatest risk of all.\n\n\"I would recommend that people make their own decisions based on an understanding of that risk,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_medaris_miller@businessinsider.com", "name": "Anna Medaris Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Immunization_and_Respiratory_Diseases", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-counter drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutrition_and_Metabolism_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutrition and Metabolism Disorders", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e667e6aebf2510c2a4c4926?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5584730", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 33842, "pinterest": 9}, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 33851, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1483729751", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-14", "time": "19:41:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-14T19:41:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-14T19:40:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-trucking-truck-driver-hours-of-service-suspended-2020-3", "title": "In an unprecedented move, the Trump administration suspended an 82-year-old road safety law for some truck drivers, showing how much coronavirus is pressuring retailers and hospitals to maintain cleaning and medical supplies", "body": "Truck drivers move 70% of the nation's goods by weight. They're responsible for replenishing stores and hospitals with necessary items.\n\nThe federal administration that oversees regulations for America's six million professional drivers has temporarily suspended a trucking safety law that's been in place since 1938.\n\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration said Friday evening that truck drivers who are moving goods \"in support of emergency relief efforts related to the COVID-19 outbreaks\" will temporarily not have to follow the hours-of-service laws, which mandate how many hours a truck driver may work.\n\nThis is the first time since 1938, when the rule was developed, that it's been suspended on a national level. It's common for states and local governments to lift the rule amid natural disasters, when consumers \"panic buy\" household goods and hospitals need medical supplies.\n\n\"Waivers of this type are a common response by FMCSA to natural disasters and crises because trucks delivering food, fuel and medicine are a critical part of the response,\" America Trucking Associations spokesperson Sean McNally said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This waiver will help keep loads of medicine, supplies and food moving as the country manages this current pandemic.\"\n\nRead more: Grocery stores would run out of food in just 3 days if long-haul truckers stopped working\n\nAround 70% of the nation's goods by weight is moved by a truck -- so ensuring that they can get to your local grocery store or hospital ramps up in times of crisis. \"Everything from the fuel you put in your vehicle to consumables in your home all get put in play because of a truck driver,\" Tampa-based truck driver Dennis Felix-Shannon told Business Insider.\n\nIn its current edition, HOS requires truck drivers to drive only 11 hours within a 14-hour work period. They must then log 10 hours of \"off-duty\" time. The safety law, which is aimed at eliminating exhausted truck drivers from the nation's highways so they do not endanger others, is disliked by many drivers. Some say the strict regulations actually disrupts their sleep schedule and makes them more likely to drive tired.\n\nAccording to the FMCSA's Friday evening emergency declaration, here are the types of loads that are exempt from HOS laws:\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak, which was ruled by the World Health Organization this week as a global pandemic, has seen \"panic buying\" envelop the nation.\n\nAcross the country, US sales of hand sanitizer, for example, jumped by 228% during the four weeks ending on March 7, compared to the same period last year, according to the most-recently available dataset from retail sales tracker Nielsen.\n\nDuring January and February, Adobe Analytics, which tracks 80 top online retailers in the US, said sales of cold, cough, and flu products popped 198%, toilet paper grew 186%, canned foods jumped 69%, and \"virus protection\" items like gloves and masks jumped 817%.\n\nRecent studies show just how damaging coronavirus can be. About 0.1% of people who get the seasonal flu die, but the coronavirus' death rate is now at about 3.4%. Even those who recover from coronavirus may have 20% to 30% less lung capacity, causing survivors to gasp for breath while walking, doctors in Hong Kong have found.\n\nBut, as any truck driver will tell you, everything from pharmaceuticals to hand sanitizer to, of course, precious toilet paper is moved by a truck before it arrives at your doorstep, local big box store, or hospital. \"Without trucking, we would be naked, starving, and homeless,\" truck driver Mike Robbins previously told Business Insider.\n\nSo, monitoring where trucking volumes are peaking or tanking is a good indicator of how panic-buying is setting in, according Aaron Terrazas, the director of economic research at tech-enabled trucking brokerage Convoy.\n\nIn the first 10 days of March, inbound volumes to Seattle increased by 12 to 15 times compared to the first 10 days of the previous month, Terrazas said. Markets in Los Angeles and New York City are starting to approach that multiplier, while inland markets like Chicago didn't have that jump in early March.\n\nPhotos shared on social media shows that truck drivers are getting slammed with orders, like this dispatch reportedly out of a Proctor and Gamble warehouse in Pennsylvania:\n\nWhile such a pressure to empty stores of consumer goods is common during weather-related disasters, hurricanes don't hit the whole country. And there's a fair estimate on when a hurricane will stop.\n\nRead more: The US is struggling to test more people for the coronavirus. Now it's facing a shortage of the materials used to run those tests.\n\nPanic buying gives customers a modicum of control as coronavirus takes over the nation with seemingly endless unknowns. \"It's about 'taking back control' in a world where you feel out of control,\" Paul Marsden, a consumer psychologist at the University of the Arts London, told CNBC this week. \"More generally, panic buying can be understood as playing to our three fundamental psychology needs.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Its response to the crisis shows that swift action and widespread healthcare can prevent an outbreak.", "body": "Countries struggling to manage their COVID-19 epidemics can learn something from Taipei's swift, multifaceted response to the virus, experts say.\n\nOnly 81 miles from mainland China, the island state of Taiwan and its nearly 24 million residents faced a dire threat as the novel coronavirus broke out in Wuhan, China, late last year.\n\nBut instead of fueling pandemonium, the country has taken control of the situation. Taiwan has only 47 confirmed cases and a single death from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, and more than 40% of infected people have recovered. The government in Taipei has implemented 124 safety protocols, a testament to its quick, vast, and well-considered battle against COVID-19. China, by comparison, has about 81,000 confirmed cases.\n\n\"The policies and actions go beyond border control,\" Jason Wang, a Stanford University pediatrics professor and policy-analysis expert, told Stanford Health Policy earlier this month, \"because they recognized that that wasn't enough.\"\n\nHow did Taiwan manage to stem a health crisis that originated in nearby China and has seen 127,000 infections and nearly 5,000 deaths around the globe?\n\nIn an article published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Wang credited the government's early and swift action: It took advantage of public-health infrastructure and data analytics, affordable healthcare, and extensive educational outreach.\n\nOn December 31, Chinese officials notified the World Health Organization that China had several cases of pneumonia. That day, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control began monitoring passengers who arrived in the country from Wuhan. Government officials boarded flights from Wuhan as soon as they landed, monitoring passengers for symptoms.\n\nLess than a week later, the government began monitoring people who had traveled from Wuhan since December 20.\n\n\"Suspected cases were screened for 26 viruses, including SARS and MERS,\" the Stanford Health Policy report said. \"Passengers displaying symptoms were quarantined at home and assessed whether medical attention at a hospital was necessary.\"\n\nIn mid-January, Taiwan sent a team of experts on a fact-finding mission to China - with permission, even though Taiwanese-Chinese relations are less than stellar.\n\n\"They didn't let us see what they didn't want us to see, but our experts sensed the situation was not optimistic,\" Kolas Yotaka, a Taiwanese government representative, told NBC News.\n\nThen the government ramped up safety and health protocols even further.\n\nBy late January, Taipei had established a Central Epidemic Command Center, centralizing policy measures to protect public health. On January 26, Taiwan became the first country to ban flights from Wuhan.\n\nAround the same time, the government banned the export of face masks and ensured they were affordable by capping prices at about $0.17 each.\n\nBy late February, Taipei had distributed nearly 6.5 million masks to primary and secondary schools, as well as after-school institutions, plus 84,000 liters of hand sanitizer and 25,000 forehead thermometers.\n\nTaiwan's health infrastructure, including big-data analysis, is partially the result of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which killed 73 people and stunted its economy.\n\nAfter the 2003 epidemic, Taiwan put temperature monitors in airports to screen travelers for fever, a symptom of COVID-19. The government had learned its lesson.\n\nTravelers can also report their travel and health history with a QR code, which the government uses \"to classify travelers' infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history in the last 14 days,\" the Stanford report said.\n\n\"People who had not traveled to high-risk areas were sent a health declaration border pass via SMS for faster immigration clearance,\" the report said. \"Those who had traveled to high-risk areas were quarantined at home and tracked through their mobile phones to ensure that they stayed home during the incubation period.\"\n\nCrucially, the government does not forget about people who tested negative for the virus - it retests them to keep track of new cases, Wang told NBC News.\n\nTaiwan's health-insurance system covers 99% of the population, Kolas told NBC News, adding that affordable coverage virtually guarantees that people don't need to choose between their personal and financial health.\n\n\"Taiwan's health insurance lets everyone not be afraid to go to the hospital. If you suspect you have coronavirus, you won't have to worry that you can't afford the hospital visit to get tested,\" she told NBC News. \"You can get a free test, and if you're forced to be isolated, during the 14 days, we pay for your food, lodging, and medical care.\n\n\"So no one would avoid seeing the doctor because they can't pay for health care,\" she added.\n\nTo stem the crisis, Taipei required television and radio stations to broadcast hourly public-service announcements about the coronavirus, including how it spreads and how people should prevent infection, NBC News reported.\n\n\"We think only when information is transparent, and people have sufficient medical knowledge, will their fear be reduced,\" Kolas told the outlet.\n\nIn turn, citizens have intensified their safety practices. Tu Chen-yang, a school principal, told NBC News that this was especially evident in schools.\n\n\"More than 95% of our parents take their child's temperature at home and report it to the school before the children arrive,\" Tu said. \"Regardless of what the government does, people have to take responsibility for their own health.\"\n\nPublic and private buildings have screened entrants for signs of fever, and apartment buildings have put hand sanitizer inside or outside elevators, NBC News reported.\n\nIt takes an entire country to keep people safe, and Taiwan's extensive coordination and swift action have helped stem the tide of coronavirus cases in the country.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

countries. The US is woefully behind.", "body": "As the coronavirus spreads globally - more than 100 countries have reported cases - governments are ramping up testing. South Korea and China have tested hundreds of thousands of cases. According to the CDC, the US has tested less than 2,000. The US has performed 5 coronavirus tests per million people, compared to South Korea's 3,692 tests per million people. In total, more than 113,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus and nearly 4,000 have died. About 70% of cases and deaths are in China. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAs of Sunday, 1,707 Americans had been tested for the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). South Korea, by contrast, has tested more than 189,000 people. The two countries announced their first coronavirus cases on the same day.\n\nIn the US, test-kit shortages have hampered health authorities' ability to get a clear sense of how many Americans are infected. Compared to many other countries impacted by the coronavirus, in fact, the US has done the fewest COVID-19 tests per capita.\n\nSouth Korea's testing total so far, when broken down into number of tests performed per million citizens, seems to be about 700 times higher than the US'.\n\nHow many people have been tested per capita in 8 countries\n\nFoto: Source: Skye Gould/Business Insider\n\nBecause China has not published national data about its coronavirus testing, Guangdong province is used here for purposes of comparison.\n\n\"The infectious-disease community and the public-health community desire to do much more testing than is currently feasible,\" William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Tennessee, told Business Insider on February 26.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Bitcoin kopen? Zo doe je dat op een veilige manier als je nu toe wilt slaan\n\n\"Other countries are testing much more broadly than we are,\" he added. \"We are trotting along while they're racing along.\"\n\nIt's likely the US has done more tests than the CDC's reported figure suggests, since the agency isn't tallying tests performed at state and private labs in the last week. US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Stephen Hahn said on Friday that the US had actually conducted 5,861 coronavirus tests, CNN reported. That number did not include tests conducted at private and commercial labs, Hahn added.\n\nFoto: People wear face masks as a precaution against coronavirus in the New York subway, March 3, 2020. Source: Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nBut even that higher number of tests per capita would still put the US behind the other seven countries listed above, with 18 tests per million people.\n\nTesting influences what we know about the coronavirus' death rate\n\nWithout adequate testing, it's challenging for US public-health officials to grasp the scope of the outbreak's spread and determine how dangerous it is. More widespread testing could impact the disease's known death rate, a basic calculation that divides the number of reported deaths by the total number of confirmed cases.\n\nThe US has one of the highest death rates in the world - about 3.6% as of Monday - but that's likely because so few mild cases have been counted.\n\nBecause testing capacity has been limited in the US, the CDC initially held stringent standards for who qualified. Until last week, the agency tested only people who had recent exposure to a confirmed patient, had traveled to a country with an outbreak, or required hospitalization.\n\nSo the US still probably has not tested or provided diagnoses to some patients with mild cases. Currently, 22 Americans have died out of about 600 cases.\n\nFoto: A healthcare worker prepares to transport a patient on a stretcher into an ambulance at Life Care Center of Kirkland, Washington on February 29, 2020. Source: David Ryder/Getty Images\n\nSouth Korea, which has the third-highest number of cases outside China, has a death rate iof just o.7% - 50 people have died out of 7,478 cases.\n\nHowever, outbreaks in both countries continue to evolve, and many patients are still hospitalized, so their conditions could change with time.\n\nA disease's death rate is also different from its mortality rate - the latter is the number of deaths out of the number of people in an at-risk population. The death rate is not a reflection of the likelihood that any given person will die if infected.\n\nAria Bendix contributed reporting.\n\nRead more: One chart shows 11 countries' current coronavirus death rates, based on the known number of cases and deaths Delays and errors have put the US far behind other countries in testing and treating coronavirus patients: 'We are trotting along while they're racing' The US has reported 23 coronavirus deaths among more than 600 cases.

The kits will allow people who are concerned that they may have been infected to swab their noses and send the samples back for testing.\n\nAccording to The Times, the results should be available in one to two days, and those who test positive can fill out an online form to answer questions about their movements to help track the spread of disease.\n\nThe foundation, which is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, pledged $100 million last month to fight the coronavirus outbreak.

If we are complacent and don't do really aggressive containment and mitigation, the number could go way up and be involved in many, many millions.\"\n\nFauci, who has been widely applauded for being a voice of clarity amid the coronavirus outbreak as Trump continues to contradict experts and spread disinformation, was also urged by Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts to push back when the president is at odds with the facts.\n\n\"The president has made some bizarre statements here,\" Lynch said. \"The cases are not going down. The American people should be aware of that. You should be forthright in explaining that.\"\n\n\"I have never ever held back telling exactly what is going on from a public health standpoint,\" Fauci, who has advised six presidents, said in response.\n\nGlobally, more than 121,500 people have been infected with coronavirus and over 4,300 have died.

It is unworkable,\" McCarthy said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters shortly after, President Donald Trump said he would not support the bill because it includes \"unrelated issues.\" Hours before, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the bill as an \"ideological wishlist.\"\n\nAs the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rose past 1,000 in the US this week, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have signaled that the scheduled recess could be delayed past Thursday. McCarthy said the legislation shouldn't be rushed but that he hoped it would be finished within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has continued last-ditch efforts to compromise on the language of the bill with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, urged Republicans to act quickly.\n\n\"We don't need 48 hours,\" Pelosi said. \"We need a decision to help families right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gina_heeb@businessinsider.com", "name": "Gina Heeb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus disease 2019"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(U.S._Representative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McCarthy (U.S. Representative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Mnuchin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Mnuchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost Management", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e6a4cb084159f4cda1432a3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5583225", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 7013}, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 7013, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1480114417", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-12", "time": "01:00:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-12T01:00:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-12T00:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9372549057006836, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/nyu-langone-er-charged-teacher-coronavirus-symptoms-10000-medical-bill-2020-3", "title": "A teacher who showed coronavirus symptoms was charged $10,000 for her ER visit  --  and was never even tested for the disease", "body": "Thanks to her health insurance, she will have to pay only $75 out of pocket - but the visit raises questions of how those without insurance will be able to afford tests and care for COVID-19.\n\nWhen she was suffering from a fever, headaches, and tightness in her chest, Brooklyn public-school teacher Erin McCarthy went to a local emergency room to get tested for the coronavirus.\n\nAfter a nearly six-hour visit, she said she left without getting tested for the coronavirus and was later slapped with an astonishing medical bill of $10,382.96.\n\nWhile she will pay only $75 out of pocket, and her insurance company will pay a negotiated-down rate, she said her experience laid bare some very real concerns as the novel coronavirus spreads across the US: the cost of COVID-19 testing and care.\n\nWhile her insurance coverage saved her thousands of dollars this time, McCarthy was previously hurt in a fall while she was uninsured - it took her years to pay off the ambulance bill.\n\n\"But imagine if I didn't have insurance,\" McCarthy told The City.\n\nOn March 2, McCarthy, 44, said she took herself to the NYU Langone emergency department in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, after experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. She had recently traveled to a region of Italy hard hit by the novel virus. The government is now fighting to control the spread of the virus in the country where infections have soared past 10,000.\n\nThe veteran teacher, who hoped to get tested for the virus, said she spent six hours in the emergency room - 20 minutes with a doctor, a short amount of time getting a chest X-ray, and the majority of the visit spent waiting.\n\n\"And I wasn't even tested,\" McCarthy told The City.\n\nAfter hours of waiting around for a test, a doctor in a hazmat suit told her she would not be eligible for the test, despite her showing symptoms associated with COVID-19, because she did not have immune-system issues and is not elderly.\n\nA patient displaying coronavirus symptoms should fit certain criteria provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to receive a test for COVID-19, since the testing capacity for the virus remains limited. This includes people who have a history of travel to an area with ongoing transmission of the disease, including China, Iran, Japan, and South Korea. Travel to Italy was not included in the affected areas that prompt a coronavirus test at the time of McCarthy's visit - but it is now.\n\nA spokesperson for NYU Langone told Business Insider that billing for hospital services is different for each patient, provider, and insurer. The final bill is also affected by what the patient was seen for and what services were provided by the hospital.\n\n\"In addition, there are different parts to a patient bill. One part is what the hospital charges the insurance company; one part is what the insurance company negotiates with the provider and eventually pays; the last part is what the patient owes for the services (also called the co-pay).\"\n\nThe spokesperson emphasized that \"the bill in question charged the insurer a fee, the insurer paid a negotiated percentage of that fee and the patient owed only a co-pay of $75.00.\" However, it remains unclear why the NYU Langone-Cobble Hill emergency department initially billed her and her insurance company over $10,000.\n\nBusiness Insider asked NYU Langone to clarify whether the high costs for her care were related to her services or were specific to treating a patient who believes they have coronavirus. They declined, but commented that \"HIPPA regulations restrict us from speaking to other issues related to her case.\"\n\nMcCarthy was later tested for COVID-19 after the New York City health commissioner expanded testing for educators, emergency responders, and health workers. While she, fortunately, discovered that she had not contracted the disease, she believes her visit raises questions about the access and affordability of care for those without health insurance.\n\nSo far, the US has 31 reported coronavirus deaths and more than 1,150 cases. As the novel virus sweeps the country, Americans have raised concerns about the costs of testing and care related to COVID-19, which many believe could discourage individuals from seeking care.\n\nOn Tuesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a directive ordering health insurers to waive all costs related to the coronavirus for emergency-room, urgent-care, and doctor visits.\n\n\"We can't let cost be a barrier to access to COVID-19 testing for any New Yorker,\" Cuomo tweeted.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who has been charged with tackling the spread of the virus in the US, announced on March 10 that major insurance companies including Anthem, Cigna, Humana, and Aetna, will waive co-pays and for testing and cover the cost of treatment of COVID-19 for Americans nationwide.\n\nHowever, those without health insurance and Americans on Medicare and Medicaid may be forced to pay up. The Trump administration said Medicare and Medicaid might not cover all care related to the coronavirus.\n\nSeema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said on Monday evening that her agency may not be able to pay for all \"products and services\" required for coronavirus patients dependent on government insurance.\n\n\"We are looking at what we cover and clarifying the types of products and services that our programs will be able to pay for in terms of Medicare and Medicaid,\" the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said.",

investors. Yet Monday's session felt like a different kettle of fish entirely,\" said one analyst.\n\nAnalysts warned of a global recession on Monday as a coronavirus-fueled sell-off dragged stocks, bond yields and oil prices lower.\n\nOil futures plummeted 26% on Monday, following their sharpest decline since the Gulf War in 1991 after OPEC+ failed to agree to cut output last week. Global stocks followed the sentiment tumbling across the board, with European stocks down more than 6% and Dow futures pointing to an opening drop of 5%.\n\nHere's what analysts are saying about the sell-off:\n\nNigel Green, chief executive and founder of deVere Group:\n\n\"A global recession is now almost inevitable this year,\" Green said.\n\n\"Oil's sharpest one-day drop since the 1991 Gulf war has further fueled the sell-off in global stock markets that started a couple of weeks ago on fears that coronavirus is going to severely damage economic growth. With the combination of the implications of the oil stand-off and the outbreak, I now believe that it's almost inevitable that there will be a global recession this year.\"\n\nNeil Wilson, chief market analyst, Markets.com:\n\n\"This will be remembered as Black Monday. If you thought it couldn't get any worse than the last fortnight, think again. The blood really is running in the streets, it's utter carnage out there.\"\n\n\"Equities have been caught in the blast from the oil bomb. There's a risk of losses in oil positions needing to be covered by selling down elsewhere - we're in a vicious circle. Equity markets are hideous today and these kind of moves are to be afraid of as they can lead to aggressive tightening in credit that can spiral into real financial distress. We don't know even know what kind of impact the coronavirus will have on the economy yet bond and equity markets are screaming recession. This is going to take a massive fiscal effort - slicing rates by 50bps ain't going to cut it,\" Wilson said.\n\nConnor Campbell, financial analyst, Spreadex:\n\n\"There have been plenty of bad days since the coronavirus infected investors. Yet Monday's session felt like a different kettle of fish entirely. Once again raising the specter of the financial crisis, the European markets suffered single-day losses not seen since the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse. Essentially, it's the equivalent of hoarding toilet roll and tinned beans - people are scared.\"\n\n\"Rather than giving investors a chance to cool down, a weekend full of alarming headlines only stoked the fires of panic. Italy is potentially planning to place 16 million people under quarantine; France has banned gatherings that exceed 1000 people; the UK saw its third death from the illness; and the number of cases in the US has hit 500,\" Campbell said.\n\nCraig Erlam, senior market analyst, OANDA Europe:\n\n\"Where do you begin on a day like today? It's absolute carnage out there and it's going to take a huge response from policy makers to restore order.\"\n\n\"As if policy makers and investors weren't struggling enough to get to grips with the rapid and unpredictable spread of the coronavirus, they've now been handed the additional problem of collapsing oil prices. On the face of it, falling oil prices during times of economic distress doesn't sound like a bad thing for consumers but central bankers, oil producers and commodity countries may not exactly agree,\" Erlam said.\n\nAdam Vettese, analyst at multi-asset investment platform, eToro:\n\n\"This is an oil-price collapse on a scale not seen since the Gulf War. Unless there is a fresh agreement between the Saudis, who can manage with oil at this level, and Russia, which can't, we can expect the price to remain under pressure.\"\n\n\"The knock-on effect on the UK's oil majors has been brutal this morning, with investors in full panic mode and it is hard to see sentiment turning in the near term.\"\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell:\n\n\"Many investors have been waiting for capitulation in the markets before thinking about buying on the dips. History suggests capitulation is quickly followed by despair and that is potentially the best time to buy ahead of a market recovery. Monday's market destruction might suggest we are moving from the panic to the capitulation stage of the investing-linked emotions cycle.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType":

Slightly more than 100 passengers along with crew members remained aboard on the next voyage, the Herald reported.\n\nA few days after disembarking, that passenger tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic. The cruise ship subsequently isolated crew members that were in close contact with that passenger, according to the Herald.\n\nUnlike other cruises with coronavirus concerns, the MSC Meraviglia wasn't held offshore to test passengers and crew. Instead, the cruise docked and disembarked normally on Sunday, with clearance from US health authorities, according to the Herald.\n\n\"If we have [the virus], it's going to spread throughout the country,\" one passenger who requested anonymity told the local newspaper. \"When I say there was no check, there was none whatsoever. I expected us to have some kind of a screening. They didn't do a single thing. We walked straight off the ship. There wasn't any check on anyone for anything.\"\n\nA spokesperson for MSC Cruises told the Herald no one onboard has symptoms of the virus, and the ship \"followed all protocols as required\" in docking and disembarking.\n\nSeveral cruise lines have temporarily suspended operations because of the global outbreak of the coronavirus. Two previous ships, the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess have drawn criticism for how they handled passengers amid coronavirus worries.\n\nThe Diamond Princess registered nearly 700 coronavirus cases. The Grand Princess docked in Oakland last week, with crew members staying aboard in isolation while many passengers will spend 14 days in at US military bases for a quarantine period.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_dunn@businessinsider.com", "name": "Andrew Dunn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus disease 2019"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSC_Meraviglia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MSC Meraviglia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSC_Cruises", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MSC Cruises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Princess_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diamond Princess (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruise line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e6e8430c485407e91017f43?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5592931", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 5474}, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 5474, "relevance": 76}], "totalResults": 750, "page": 1, "count": 25, "pages": 30}}
