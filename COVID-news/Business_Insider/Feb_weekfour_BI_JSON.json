He told associates the White House \"had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance,\" The Times said.\n\n\"This is not true,\" said a NIAID spokesperson of the report, in an emailed statement to Business Insider.\n\nFauci has led the institute -- a federal agency focused on researching infectious diseases -- since 1984, and he has a key role in coordinating efforts on global health issues, according to the agency's website.\n\nHe has also advised six presidents on domestic and global health issues such as HIV and AIDS.\n\nFauci's public remarks on the novel coronavirus in recent days have struck a markedly different tone from those delivered by Trump, who has played down the likely impact of the illness COVID-19 and is reportedly concerned that negative messages from public officials will spook financial markets.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Fauci warned that travel restrictions, such as those introduced by the Trump administration for some visitors from China, would become \"irrelevant\" if the coronavirus became a pandemic because \"you can't keep out the entire world.\"\n\nHe also told CNN last week that the world was on the brink of a coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump on Wednesday said the US was \"rapidly developing a vaccine\" for the coronavirus and \"will essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.\" But in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Fauci had said the process of developing a vaccine could take up to a year and a half.\n\n\"Even though we are going as fast as you possibly can, it's still going to take a good year, year and a half to see if we have a vaccine that works,\" he said.\n\nHealth and national security experts have criticized the Trump administration for stopping one of its top public-health officials from speaking freely as the US faces its worst public-health crisis in years.\n\nNed Price, a top National Security Council aide under the Obama administration, tweeted Thursday: \"During the Ebola outbreak, we couldn't get enough of @NIH's Dr. Fauci because no one knew more or could deliver it with more authority or experience. Muzzling Dr. Fauci is an effort to muzzle fact and science when it's needed most.\"\n\n\"Presidents Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama trusted Tony Fauci to be their top adviser on infectious disease, and the nation's most trusted communicator to the public,\" Ronald Klain, who led the Obama administration's response to the 2014 Ebola crisis, also said.\n\n\"If Trump is changing that, it is a threat to public health and safety.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_porter@businessinsider.com", "name": "Tom Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

the very government programs responsible for combatting a global health crisis.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spent much of Tuesday reassuring the public that the coronavirus is under control.\n\n\"China is working very, very hard,\" Trump told reporters at a business roundtable at the US embassy in New Delhi, India. \"I have spoken to President Xi [Jinping of China], and they are working very hard. If you know anything about him, I think he will be in pretty good shape. They have had a rough patch, but now it looks like they are getting it more and more under control. I think that is a problem that is going to go away.\"\n\nTrump's comments are at odds with reality.\n\nThe coronavirus, or COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, China and has killed 2,700 people globally and spread to 30 countries. There are at least 36 confirmed cases in the US, including repatriated citizens.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it expects the virus to spread further within the US.\n\n\"It's not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more, but a question of when this will happen,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a press call on Tuesday. \"We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad.\"\n\nMessonnier also warned that the agency is \"preparing as if we are going to see community spread in the near term,\" adding that the outbreak could soon lead to a \"disruption to everyday life.\"\n\nFears of a pandemic come after the Trump administration spent the past several years gutting the very government programs that are tasked with combatting such a crisis.\n\nIn 2018, for instance, the CDC cut 80% of its efforts to prevent global disease outbreaks because it was running out of money. Ultimately, the department went from working in 49 countries to just ten.\n\nHere are some other actions the Trump administration undertook to dismantle government spending programs related to fighting the spread of global diseases, according to Foreign Policy:\n\nThe CDC is working on a new test to screen for the coronavirus, but according to New York Magazine, problems with the test's development resulted in only three out of 100 public-health labs being equipped to screen for the virus. Moreover, each test costs as much as $250, and the Health and Human Services department is already running out of money to finance an adequate response to the outbreak.\n\nThe Trump administration recently requested $2.5 billion in emergency funds -- $1.25 billion in new funding and $1.25 billion to be diverted from other federal programs -- to aid in preparing and responding to coronavirus cases in the US.\n\nBut Democratic lawmakers and health experts skewered the administration for not going far enough to combat the crisis.\n\nThe economic consequences of an unaddressed outbreak would dwarf US spending on efforts to control it, Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist and the director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told Insider.\n\n\"It seems quite inadequate and absurd to divert funds from one serious epidemic to another,\" Lipsitch said of the emergency funding package. \"Money to control it is a very important investment.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gina_heeb@businessinsider.com", "name": "Gina Heeb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sonam_sheth@businessinsider.com", "name": "Sonam Sheth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Repatriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_T.H._Chan_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard T.H.

so that they can end Donald Trump's streak of winning is a new level of sickness.\n\n\"I don't know if this is coronavirus or Trump derangement syndrome, but these people are infected badly.\"\n\nWhile other Fox programming brought on reporters and experts relaying evidence critical of the administration's handling of the coronavirus - which has been bungled at several junctures already - the hosts of Fox & Friends were, as usual, far more friendly to President Trump in their framing of the events.\n\n\"Are you surprised the way they've been handling the coronavirus situation?\" host Brian Kilmeade asked Trump Jr. before clarifying, \"Meaning Democrats.\"\n\nThe president's eldest son alluded to a New York Times article -- an opinion story titled \"Let's Call It Trumpvirus\" -- during his appearance: \"To run that in The New York Times, this isn't Vox, this isn't one of these crazy left-wing [outlets] ... \"\n\nWritten by opinion columnist Gail Collins, the op-ed skewers Trump for putting Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the coronavirus during his meandering press conference earlier this week.\n\n\"They can have it both ways,\" Trump Jr. said,

Trump's history of lying about crises is a 'real problem' as he downplays coronavirus and contradicts the CDC", "body": "On a scale of one to 10, one expert at Harvard gave the US a five in terms of preparedness for coronavirus, and told Insider said the Trump administration gets a \"D\" in messaging for \"confusing the public.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has documented record of lying or embellishing when it comes to crises that affect public safety, and this could pose major risks to Americans as his administration responds to the growing threat of coronavirus, public health experts warn.\n\n\"President Trump has a history of hyping up panic, like he did by calling for a travel ban during the West African epidemic. Or he can give a sense of false assurance like saying China and the US have [coronavirus] totally under control,\" Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University who has advised the World Health Organization on pandemic preparedness, told Insider.\n\n\"Overall, his reputation for telling untruths and exaggerating truths is very harmful when he has to advise a frightened public during a major outbreak,\" Gostin added.\n\nGostin said there have already been \"highly conflicting messages from the Trump administration,\" with the president stating that coronavirus was \"under control\" but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that it's likely to \"spread widely\" in the US.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1232058127740174339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nThe CDC's warning came amid new outbreaks in Iran, Italy, and South Korea that have raised fears of a global pandemic.\n\n\"It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said during a media briefing on Tuesday.\n\nTrump in the past has made numerous false statements about various crises. Trump, for example, in April falsely tweeted that Puerto Rico got $91 billion in assistance after Hurricane Maria as he complained about the cost of the recovery effort. And in September, Trump appeared to use a black Sharpie to doctor a map on the trajectory of Hurricane Dorian to bolster his false claims about where it would strike in the US.\n\nPolls have repeatedly shown that a majority of Americans view Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy, and this presents a major problem when facing a potential global pandemic.\n\n\"The fact that a large proportion of the US public does not view the president as a credible messenger is a real problem,\" Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development who oversaw the Obama administration's response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa as director for foreign disaster assistance at USAID, told Insider.\n\n\"He has undermined his credibility through...Sharpiegate, through some of the things he said about Puerto Rico and the Hurricane Maria response,\" Konyndyk added. \"The more the president puts his fingerprints on the messaging and the public perception on this, that is probably counterproductive.\"\n\nKonyndyk went on to say that Trump's tendency to frame situations as being about him is also highly problematic as the US braces for the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, which has already killed over 2,700 and infected over 80,000 worldwide.\n\n\"The focus here should not be the president,\" Konyndyk said. \"The focus here should not be anyone's electoral prospects. The focus should be candor and transparency about the risks and about what people need to do to protect and prepare themselves.\"\n\nTrump's attempts to sound positive about the potential effects of coronavirus in the US appear to be linked to concerns over its impact on the stock market, which has taken a hit amid rising anxiety about the disease.\n\nThe president is seeking reelection this year, and a strong economy is crucial to that effort. Trump frequently boasts about the financial markets along the campaign trail, taking credit for economic growth in the US. He is reportedly furious that the stock market is nosediving over coronavirus fears, and on Wednesday suggested the media was to blame by unnecessarily spreading alarm.\n\n\"Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) & @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump's focus on the stock market in relation to coronavirus is a \"huge concern,\" Konyndyk said.\n\nThe president is sending \"inaccurate risk-messaging\" by telling people \"this is not a big deal...and he's doing that to keep the markets calm,\" he added.\n\nAnd from a \"purely political perspective,\" Konyndyk said this is an \"incredibly dumb\" approach from Trump.\n\n\"He is taking, perhaps unconsciously, an enormous political risk by trying to buy some short-term calm in the markets at the expense of accurate risk communication. That could hugely backfire on him,\" Konyndyk said.\n\nGiven the consensus on the risk to the US and the world at large, public health experts are not encouraged by the Trump administration's approach to coronavirus so far, particularly in terms of the president's attempts to downplay its potential severity.\n\n\"It's obvious that Trump is getting ahead of his skis on saying that everything is normal. Two weeks ago or so he said [coronavirus] will be gone by April because it's going to get warmer. We don't think that's happening at this point,\" Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, told Insider.\n\n\"The CDC is trying to give a reality of what's likely to come and scientific experts all agree - that pandemic is likely to come,\" Feigl-Ding said.\n\nFeigl-Ding said it's especially problematic that there has been limited testing for coronavirus in the US, which is linked to faulty testing kits that were sent out by the CDC earlier this month. This hinders the government's ability to know the actual number of coronavirus cases in the US. While South Korea has run over 35,000 coronavirus tests, US has only tested about 500 people.\n\nIn this context, Feigl-Ding said it's \"irresponsible\" for Trump and his allies like Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, to say they have things \"under control.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1232378152598605824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\n\"To say we have everything under control when you have almost no testing is really, really silly and disingenuous...It's very irresponsible to say everything is fine when we are very much in the dark about the actual epidemic status,\" Feigl-Ding said.\n\nOn a scale of one to 10, Feigl-Ding gave the US a five in terms of preparedness for coronavirus, and he said the Trump administration gets a \"D\" in messaging for \"confusing the public.\" But he commended the CDC for \"speaking the truth\" about the inevitability of the disease's spread.\n\n\"We're behind the curve, possibly well behind the curve,\" Konyndyk said. \"There's a big disconnect between public perception and the actual reality of the risk. The public has been hearing for a month that the risk to the US is low, that the risk to the US under control, and that the focus is on containment...What that sets up then, is a sort of whiplash effect in public perception, if and when cases begin spreading at scale.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

likely make any coronavirus vaccine free for patients  --  and prove critical in fighting the disease", "body": "The ACA has the potential to form a critical pillar in a federal strategy to combat the spread of a fast-moving coronavirus.\n\nThe coronavirus is spreading around the world and scores of new cases are diagnosed daily, as the disease breaks far beyond its point of origin in Wuhan, China.\n\nThere are at least 63 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States. But that figure is still significantly fewer compared to other nations. Europe has seen a surge of new infections in recent days, bringing the total number to over 85,100 people in 56 nations. The overwhelming majority - 95% - of cases remain in China.\n\nHealth officials, though, are warning that its spread in the US is \"inevitable\" and urging Americans to prepare, holding out the possibility of school closings, workplace shutdowns, or the cancellation of large public gatherings.\n\nYet public concern is rising that the US's expensive healthcare system could create a barrier discouraging people from seeking life-saving care for COVID-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus - and accelerate its spread around the country.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar heightened those anxieties this week when he initially said the government couldn't control prices for coronavirus treatments because \"it needed the private sector to invest.\" He later walked back those remarks after triggering massive backlash.\n\nA cautionary tale also sprung onto the public eye. Earlier this week, the Miami Herald reported that a local resident named Osmel Martinez Azcue had recently returned from China with flu-like symptoms and decided to test himself for the coronavirus at a hospital. He tested positive for the flu, and not the virus.\n\nBut his prudence came at a cost. Azcue had a skimpy short-term health insurance plan which critics deride as a \"junk plan.\" As a result, he racked up a substantial bill for being tested. Azcue received a claim from his insurer for $3,270 and will have to pony up at least $1,470, the newspaper reported. He's on the hook for more.\n\nYet one layer of the healthcare system could help Americans save a lot of money on a potential coronavirus vaccine: the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nA little-known provision of Obamacare would likely make any coronavirus vaccine free for most people with health insurance. Plus, the law expanded insurance coverage for roughly 20 million Americans and widened access to medical care. Those components underscore the law's broad reach across the healthcare sector and its potential to form a pillar in a federal strategy to combat the spread of a deadly, unknown disease.\n\n\"There's an important link between broader healthcare policies like the Affordable Care Act and responding to a potential public health emergency like this virus,\" Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Business Insider.\n\nLevitt added that providing people access to inexpensive healthcare is \"key to both preventing the spread of a virus like this and getting people who are sick treated.\"\n\nThe development of a vaccine that successfully treats COVID-19 is still far off - at least a year in the best case scenario, given the rounds of rigorous testing involved.\n\nUnder the ACA, health insurers must cover federally-recommended vaccines at no cost for most people, according to John Cogan, a professor of health insurance law and financial regulation at the University of Connecticut.\n\n\"Everyone under Obamacare would be covered under this vaccination without cost-sharing,\" Cogan told Business Insider. That would extend to the health insurance people get through their employers, as well as to most health insurance programs like Medicaid for children and people with low incomes, he said.\n\nThe cost of getting a shot has surged over the last two decades, the New York Times reported. The price of an influenza vaccine can range anywhere from $20 to 40 a shot, meaning a family of four could pay up to $160 a year. Then a shingles vaccine recommended for people 50 years and over can cost upwards of $140.\n\n\"The vaccines that we rely on everyday are expensive. They're not $10,000 a shot, but they're costly enough that a lot of people can't afford them,\" Cogan said.\n\nPresident Obama's signature law - passed in 2010 -bans insurers from applying co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance to vaccinations recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ensuring they're basically free for patients covered under those plans.\n\nA similar provision of the law makes other kinds of preventive healthcare, such as mammograms and annual checkups, free for patients, as long as they get them from a doctor who accepts their insurance.\n\nCogan said he's still concerned about whether a coronavirus vaccine will be affordable, given the Trump administration's support of a lawsuit that would scrap Obamacare in its entirety.\n\nHe noted that Trump has sought to weaken and dismantle the health law throughout his presidency- one way was introducing cheaper short-term insurance plans that don't cover costly services like hospital care or protect people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe ACA's free-vaccine requirement doesn't apply to those short-term plans, meaning people with that type of coverage would have to pay out-of-pocket to get a vaccination. The White House also ended subsidies helping to keep cost-sharing down, pricing out some people from getting ACA-compliant insurance.\n\nCogan said that Azar could ensure Americans can get a potential vaccine by stopping efforts to unravel Obamacare.\n\n\"If he wants to make it affordable, back off attacking the ACA. Because that will make it affordable for most people,\" he said.\n\nCogan isn't the only one thinking about the potential cost of a coronavirus vaccine. Bill Gates, who's supporting efforts to come up with a vaccine and fight the coronavirus outbreak, wrote on Friday that any breakthrough treatment has to be reasonably priced.\n\n\"During a pandemic, vaccines and antivirals can't simply be sold to the highest bidder,\" Gates wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"They should be available and affordable for people who are at the heart of the outbreak and in greatest need. Not only is such distribution the right thing to do, it's also the right strategy for short-circuiting transmission and preventing future pandemics.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com",

huge cuts to the CDC's budget by saying the government can hire more doctors 'when we need them' during crises", "body": "President Trump defended his huge budget cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during a Wednesday press conference on the federal government's response to the coronavirus.\n\nHe maintained that it was easy to bolster the agency, and cited his business abilities.\n\n\"I'm a businessperson, I don't like having thousands of people around when you don't need them,\" Trump said. \"When we need them, we can get them back very quickly.\"\n\nThe president said that some of the experts targeted by the cuts \"hadn't been used for many years,\" and that additional federal money and new medical staffers could be obtained swiftly since \"we know all the good people.\"\n\nThe remarks come amid warnings from CDC experts that the virus' spread in the US was \"inevitable\" and urged Americans to prepare. But the Trump administration has spent the last two years gutting critical positions and programs that health experts say weakened the federal government's ability to manage a health crisis.\n\nIn 2018, the White House eliminated a position on the National Security Council tasked with coordinating a global pandemic response. The CDC that same year also axed 80% of its efforts combating disease outbreaks overseas because its funds were depleted.\n\nIn its latest budget proposal, the Trump administration sought to cut CDC funding by 16% -- even as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar seeks emergency spending from lawmakers to combat the coronavirus.\n\nIt has spread to at least 47 countries so far, beyond its point of origin in China and particularly in Europe. The US has 60 confirmed cases so far, though the vast majority of them sprung overseas.\n\nJen Kates, the director of the Global Health and HIV Policy Program at the Kaiser Family Foundation said in an email to Business Insider that the latest round of proposed budget cuts \"would certainly hamper the work of the agency.\"\n\nShe noted the CDC has \"already been grappling with tight resources for addressing the nation's public health, as well as domestic and global health security threats.\"\n\n\"To date, such funding has been episodic, typically coming only after outbreaks hit a tipping point and rarely being enough to shore up resources in the long run,\" Kates said.\n\nOther experts elaborated on the cumbersome process to shore up an government agency that's been battered by rounds of budget cuts.\n\nDon Moynihan, a public management professor at Georgetown University, said in a tweet that \"once you have gutted institutional capacity you cannot, in fact, quickly restore it.\"\n\nAppropriating federal money to the CDC would require a bill from Congress that passes both chambers for Trump's signature, said Bobby Kogan, the chief mathematician for the Senate Budget Committee.\n\n\"In addition to requiring a new law to be passed to hire people, you have to actually, you know, spend the time to hire people,\" Kogan said in a tweet.", "source": {"uri":

As Israel's primary airport, Ben Gurion International Airport serves as the main airports for both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as well as most cities in the northern half of the country, with most visitors to Israel passing through the airport.\n\nThe flight was operated by a Boeing 777-200, according to FlightAware data, which seat over 200 passengers. The Times of Israel reported that around 200 South Koreans were on board the flight, with over 30 being diagnosed with the virus, according to the South Korea Center for Disease Control.\n\nAfter returning to Seoul, the Los Angeles Times reported that the flight attendant may have operated two additional flights between the South Korean capital and Los Angeles. The flights that were serviced by the flight attendant, KE17 and KE12, reportedly took place on February 19 and 20, respectively, with a one-night layover in Los Angeles, the LA Times reported.\n\nKorean Air operates multiple daily flights between Seoul and Los Angeles with some of its largest aircraft including the Airbus A380 and a Boeing 747-8i.

Ireland has also advised its citizens not to travel to affected areas of Italy.\n\nRomania's health ministry on Sunday said all Romanian citizens coming back from Lombardy and Veneto would be quarantined for 14 days, Politico reported.\n\nAustria temporarily halted rail traffic across its border with Italy but later recommenced it.\n\nCOVID-19 cases have also been recorded in Germany, the UK, France, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, and Finland, but all have only a handful of confirmed patients and in some cases as few as one.\n\nThe coronavirus, thought to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has now infected more than 70,000 people in China and has spread to at least 29 other countries.\n\nThe World Health Organization warned over the weekend that the window of opportunity to contain the virus was narrowing.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sinead_baker@businessinsider.com", "name":

Nitrogen dioxide is emitted by burning fuel, cars, power plants, and construction machinery, and it can aggravate respiratory symptoms and asthma, among other negative effects.\n\nChina's cities rank among the most polluted in the world, with Hotan and Kashgar in the top 20 according to an IQAir report.\n\nNASA published satellite imagery on Saturday, which you can see above, showing nitrogen dioxide levels in China before and after the country began imposing lockdowns on 23 January.\n\nIt also showed drastic declines in pollutants around Wuhan, which has appeared to be the source of the outbreak and was the first city to be quarantined.\n\nThe data came from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-5 satellite, and similar data came from NASA's Aura satellite.\n\nFei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA, said, \"This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event.\"\n\nThere is often a pollution dropoff in China around specific celebrations and events. Factories and other businesses close for the Lunar New Year in late January and early February, leading to a decline in air pollution.

Patients in their 50s were about three times more likely to die than patients in their 40s. Here's the mortality rate for every age bracket. For the latest case total and death toll, see Business Insider's live updates here. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe coronavirus has reached every continent except Antarctica, but it doesn't infect all patients equally.\n\nA recent study from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the virus most seriously affected older people with preexisting health problems. About 80% of coronavirus cases are mild, the research showed.\n\nThe study collected data from more than 44,000 confirmed patients in China through February 11. It offers one of broadest depictions of how COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, operates in humans.\n\nThe data suggests a person's chances of dying from the disease increase with age. Here's the mortality rate for each age bracket, according to the study:\n\nFoto: Source: Shayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nThe study did not report any deaths in children younger than 10, who represented less than 1% of the patients.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Deze grafieken geven een ander beeld van het coronavirus: aantal mensen dat geneest stijgt nu harder dan nieuwe besmettingen\n\nPatients ages 10 to 19 were just as likely to die as patients in their 30s, but patients in their 50s were about three times more likely to die than patients in their 40s.\n\nThe risk of dying is dramatically higher among patients in their 70s and 80s, likely because many of those people have preexisting health issues.\n\nCoronavirus patients with heart disease, for instance, had an about 10% mortality rate, according to the study, while those with diabetes had around a 7% mortality rate.\n\nAbout three-quarters of the Chinese patients had no preexisting health problems. The fatality rate for that group was just under 1%.\n\nHere's how the coronavirus compares with a handful of other major outbreaks.\n\nFatality statistics could change as the coronavirus spreads around the globe, however.\n\n\"If indeed we discover that there are far more cases than are actually being reported - and that one of the primary reasons for this is that we're just not detecting asymptomatic or mild or moderately symptomatic cases that don't end up seeking healthcare - then our estimates for the case fatality rate will likely decrease,\" Lauren Ancel Meyers, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin, told Business Insider.\n\nIn total, COVID-19 has killed more than 2,800 people and infected more than 82,000. It originated in Wuhan, central China's most populous city, and has since spread to 47 other countries.

According to CNBC, it was the first time the benchmark posted consecutive losses of at least 800 points.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, is significantly downplaying the possibility of a severe coronavirus outbreak in the US.\n\n\"China is working very, very hard,\" Trump told reporters at a business roundtable at the US Embassy in New Delhi. \"I have spoken to President Xi, and they are working very hard. If you know anything about him, I think he will be in pretty good shape. They have had a rough patch, but now it looks like they are getting it more and more under control.

The vast majority of cases and deaths are in China, but there are now multiple countries with hundreds of cases each.

Experts think the coronavirus jumped from live animals to people at a market.", "body": "The virus is thought to have originated in bats, which may have passed it to an intermediary species that then passed it to humans at a market in Wuhan, China.\n\nChina's wildlife-farming industry, valued at $74 billion, has been permanently shut down.\n\nOn Monday, the nation's legislature banned the buying, selling, and eating of wild animals in an effort to prevent zoonotic diseases from jumping from animals to people.\n\nThe novel coronavirus, which has killed at least 2,700 people, is thought to have been transmitted to humans by pigs, civets, or pangolins at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China.\n\n\"There has been a growing concern among people over the consumption of wild animals and the hidden dangers it brings to public health security since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak,\" Zhang Tiewei, a legislative spokesman, told Reuters Monday.\n\nZhang added that the decision came at a \"critical moment for the epidemic prevention and control.\"\n\nOfficials closed the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market on January 1, and Wuhan authorities banned the live-animal trade at all markets in the city soon thereafter.\n\nA few weeks later, Chinese authorities temporarily banned the buying, selling, and transportation of wild animals in markets, restaurants, and online marketplaces across the country. Farms that breed and transport wildlife were also quarantined and shut down. The ban was expected to stay in place until the coronavirus epidemic ended, Xinhua News reported. But now it's permanent.\n\nMuch of China's wildlife trade, according to experts, was already illegal: China's Wildlife Protection Law bans the hunting and selling of endangered species but doesn't apply to all wild animals. But the practice persisted because of lax enforcement and legal loopholes, such as inconsistencies in species' names and online sales of exotic wildlife as pets.\n\nThe full list of species protected under the new ban is still unclear. It covers wildlife already protected by law, other terrestrial animals of \"important ecological, scientific and social value,\" and terrestrial wild animals in breeding farms, according to China's People's Daily. It does not apply to aquatic animals, livestock, or poultry.\n\nChina's wild-meat industry is valued at $7.1 billion and employs 1 million people, Nature reported. The value of the larger wildlife-farming industry is closer to $74 billion, according to a 2017 report by the Chinese Academy of Engineering.\n\n\"A total ban on trading wild animals would criminalize a substantial proportion of the Chinese population, and be untenable,\" Zhao-Min Zhou, a Chinese wildlife-policy researcher, told Nature. He added that shuttering animal markets would just move the trade to the black market.\n\nSince the outbreak began, Chinese authorities have shut down 20,000 farms raising peacocks, civet cats, porcupines, ostriches, and wild geese, The Guardian reported.\n\nBut many experts support this type of intervention to help prevent the spread of viruses.\n\n\"The government has signaled that it wants to take immediate action to prevent any future outbreaks of diseases that spread from animals to humans,\" Li Zhang, a conservation biologist at Beijing Normal University, told Nature. He added that wildlife trade and consumption represented a direct threat to animals and a major public-health risk.\n\nThat's because the close proximity of shoppers and vendors to live and dead animals at wet markets creates a breeding ground for zoonotic diseases.\n\n\"For cultural reasons in the region, people want to see the specific animals they're buying be slaughtered in front of them, so they know they're receiving the products they paid for,\" Emily Langdon, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Chicago, wrote in an article. \"That means there's a lot of skinning of dead animals in front of shoppers and, as a result, aerosolizing of all sorts of things.\"\n\nThree-quarters of new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than other mammals. They pass them along in their poop: If a bat drops feces onto a piece of fruit that another animal then eats, that creature can become a carrier.\n\nGenetic evidence suggests that the new coronavirus almost certainly originated in bats, which passed it to another animal. The virus then jumped from that animal to people at a wildlife market. SARS (which is caused by a coronavirus) originated in bats too, then jumped to civets, which passed it to people in a Chinese wet market. The SARS coronavirus infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 between 2002 and 2003.\n\nExperts still aren't sure which animal species served as the new coronavirus' intermediary between bats and people. Many possibilities have been floated, including snakes (which is unlikely), pigs, civets, and pangolins -- endangered mammals that are roasted and eaten in China, Vietnam, and parts of West Africa and whose scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nPangolins were the most trafficked nonhuman species in the world in 2013, according to National Geographic. The Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species declared pangolin trade illegal in 2016.\n\nThe trade and consumption of pangolins was already illegal under China's Wildlife Protection Law.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki",

A UC Davis internal memo said medical workers requested the individual be tested a week ago, but the CDC declined to test the patient as they did not meet the required criteria for a test. The patient had not recently travelled to China nor had any known contact with another person infected by COVID-19.

UC Davis Health does not control the testing process,\" the memo continued.\n\nRep. John Garamendi of California, who represents the district where the patient is being treated, tweeted he is in \"close contact\" with the CDC and the state regarding the situation.\n\n\"We all have the responsibility to protect ourselves and others by washing our hands and carrying out procedures to avoid infecting ourselves and others,\" he continued. \"Please monitor CDC's website and Facebook

He's tackled the AIDS, Zika, and Ebola epidemics. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAnthony Fauci has guided the US through the AIDS, Zika, and Ebola epidemics.\n\nHe's been the director of the US' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984, advising six presidents. George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2008.\n\nFauci is now helping to lead the response to the new coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBut the Trump administration has reportedly told Fauci and other top health officials \"not to say anything else without clearance\" from the White House, according to The New York Times. A NIAID spokesperson told Business Insider that \"this is not true,\" however.\n\nFauci's comments about the coronavirus have contradicted Trump's several times. Whereas Trump said the US \"will essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner,\" Fauci has estimated that we're between a year and a year-and-a-half away from a coronavirus vaccine. Trump also expressed optimism that COVID-19 - the disease the virus causes - will disappear, but Fauci has suggested the world is on the brink of a pandemic.\n\nUS health experts were angry about the White House's restrictions on Fauci's speech, the Times reported, given that the world is in the midst of one of the worst public-health crises in years.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Deze grafieken geven een ander beeld van het coronavirus: aantal mensen dat geneest stijgt nu harder dan nieuwe besmettingen\n\n\"Presidents Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama trusted Tony Fauci to be their top adviser on infectious disease, and the nation's most trusted communicator to the public,\" Ronald Klain, who led the Obama administration's response to the 2014 Ebola crisis, tweeted on Thursday.\n\nHe added, \"If Trump is changing that, it is a threat to public health and safety.\"\n\nHere are some of Fauci's biggest accolades and achievements.\n\nFauci joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as an autoimmune-disease researcher after getting his doctorate from Cornell University.\n\nFoto: Anthony Fauci attends the 21st International AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa, on July 19, 2016.
