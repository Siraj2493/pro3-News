No human cases have been reported. The mortality rate of the disease is about 60% in people. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nIn the shadow of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, a deadly disease has emerged in chickens in a Chinese province near the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs reported an animal outbreak of the often fatal H5N1 bird flu in thousands of chickens in the Hunan province, which borders the Hubei province to the south.\n\n\"The farm has 7,850 chickens, and 4,500 of the chickens have died from the contagion. Local authorities have culled 17,828 poultry after the outbreak,\" a statement by China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said on February 1.\n\nThere are no reported human cases of the H5N1 avian flu, according to South China Morning Post, and transmission of the disease to humans is rare. Nearly all cases of avian-flu infection in people have been associated with \"close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments,\" according to the World Health Organization.\n\nHowever, the outbreak is a cause for concern because this avian flu has a 60% mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO. Additionally, the H5N1 bird flu can cause severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia, and neurological changes such as an altered mental state and seizures.\n\n\"If the H5N1 virus were to change and become easily transmissible from person to person while retaining its capacity to cause severe disease, the consequences for public health could be very serious,\" WHO said in a statement.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Aftrekposten voor je belastingaangifte 2019: je ziektekosten\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the H5N1 bird flu to have \"pandemic potential.\"\n\n\"Flu viruses are constantly changing and animal flu viruses can change such that they may gain the ability to infect people easily and spread among people, causing a pandemic,\" the CDC's website says.\n\nThe H5N1 avian flu was first detected in geese in China in 1996. The first human cases were diagnosed in 1997 in Hong Kong. The most recent case was reported in January 2014 from an person who had recently returned to Canada from China.\n\n\"To date, there have not been any reports of HPAI Asian H5N1 virus infections in people in the United States and Asian H5N1 has never been detected in US birds or poultry,\" the CDC website says.\n\nThe news of this chicken outbreak comes as China grapples with the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 900 people in China and infected 40,000 globally. Nearly 100 deaths were reported on Sunday, the highest single-day death toll since the outbreak emerged less than two months ago.\n\nChina is racing to build new hospitals and replenish stores of food, test kits, and other critical medical supplies to combat the coronavirus.\n\nRead more: The Wuhan coronavirus has killed more than 900 people and infected over 40,000.

buses, and markets in coronavirus-afflicted areas to curb the outbreak's contagion, financial news outlet Caixin reported Saturday.\n\nThe People's Bank of China ordered all paper currency with high exposure to the outbreak withdraw cash for either destruction or disinfection, according to Caixin. Commercial banks were told to place banknotes from infected areas aside, clean them, and hand them to the central bank.\n\nThe coronavirus continues to spread around the world and most heavily hit China's population.

Coronavirus has already prompted economists to lower their expectations for global growth, and major corporations have warned that the drag on global supply chains will likely hit quarterly results.\n\nThe People's Bank of China will use high temperatures or ultraviolet light to disinfect bills and store the cash for more than 14 days before placing it back into circulation. Central banks around the world frequently destroy old notes to balance out the supply with new cash. The practice doesn't affect the money supply, though the coronavirus-related action is separate from such regular measures.\n\nAn unnamed deputy chief at a large bank in Guangzhou told Caixin that, while customers will be asked where their deposited cash is from, \"it would be difficult for such a measure to be completely effective.\"\n\nThe central bank's deputy governor, Fan Yifei, said on Saturday that 600 billion yuan ($85.6 billion) has been injected into China's financial system since January 17, according to the South China Morning Post. About 4 billion yuan had been sent to Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, before the Lunar New Year holiday on January 25.\n\nYifei also said the central bank will add more cash to banks to help businesses survive through the outbreak and lasting tensions borne from the US-China trade war, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nChina's economic growth has slowed through recent years as trade hurdles and slowing global expansion dragged on gross domestic product. The coronavirus is now expected to cut as much as 1.6 percentage points from its next-quarter growth, according to Goldman Sachs. The slowdown will also harm other Asian economies, with Taiwan, Korea, and Thailand the most exposed to lagging tourism and decreased export activity, Goldman analysts wrote in a note.\n\nNow read

Some researchers suspect that men have certain biological conditions that make them more likely to contract the virus. But others have suggested that women are just as susceptible. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe deadly coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, has infected more men than women, and scientists are divided about why that is.\n\nThe virus has killed more than 910 people and infected more than 40,000, with the vast majority of cases in mainland China. (For the latest case total and death toll, see Business Insider's live updates here.) A recent study of nearly 140 coronavirus patients at a Wuhan University hospital offers one of the broadest pictures of how the virus operates in humans so far.\n\nThe researchers found that the virus is most likely to affect older men with preexisting health problems. More than 54% of the patients in the study were men, and patients had a median age of 56.\n\nOther recent studies have produced similar results. A study of 99 coronavirus patients at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital found that the average patient was 55.5 years old, and men represented around 68% of the total cases. A third study of nearly 1,100 coronavirus patients (which is still awaiting peer review) identified a median age of 47, with men representing around 58% of all cases.\n\nThis data has led some researchers to suspect that men have certain biological conditions that make them more susceptible to the virus. But other researchers aren't so sure.\n\nSARS affected mostly men, too\n\nIn the absence of much reliable, broad data about the new coronavirus, scientists have turned to a similar outbreak - the SARS pandemic from 2002 to 2003 - for clues.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Aftrekposten voor je belastingaangifte 2019: je ziektekosten\n\nSARS was also a coronavirus that jumped from animals to people in wet markets. It shares about 80% of its genome with the novel coronavirus, and like the current outbreak, it infected more men than women.\n\nFoto: Customers wear face masks inside a supermarket following an outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan.sourceReuters\n\nIn 2017, researchers at the University of Iowa set out to investigate why that was by infecting male and female mice with SARS. Mice studies don't necessarily have definitive implications for humans, but the researchers did find that male mice were more susceptible to the virus than female mice.\n\nThe team attributed those results to genes located on the X chromosome, as well as hormones such as estrogen, that may keep a virus from spreading throughout the female body.\n\nThe researchers at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital gave a similar explanation for why more of their coronavirus patients were men, suggesting that women may have a \"reduced susceptibility\" to viral infections. But they also noted that many patients with severe cases had chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Those particular illnesses tend to affect middle-aged men more than middle-aged women.\n\nThe outbreak started among mostly male workers\n\nAaron Milstone, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told Business Insider that he doesn't think one subset of the population is necessarily more vulnerable than another.\n\n\"When we see any new virus, the whole population is susceptible,\" he said.\n\nThe new study from Wuhan University also found that the share of male and female coronavirus patients in the ICU was about the same as the share of male and female coronavirus patients in other parts of the hospital. That suggests the men's symptoms weren't more severe than women's overall (though some patients are still hospitalized, so their conditions could change over time).\n\nThe researchers attributed the higher number of male patients to the fact that the outbreak originated at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, among mostly male workers there.\n\nBut Milstone said any data set from this coronavirus outbreak is still inherently limited at this point.\n\n\"There can be underreporting because of under-testing, especially because this is not a commercially available test,\" Milstone said. \"We don't know enough yet about what's happening.\"\n\nHave you been personally impacted by the coronavirus epidemic?

They could spread the virus through poop.", "body": "For the latest case total, death toll, and travel information, see Business Insider's live updates here.\n\nThe deadly new coronavirus that has spread from the city of Wuhan, China is giving some patients nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nThe coronavirus is part of a family of respiratory illnesses that includes the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Patients often show pneumonia-like symptoms, especially fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.\n\nBut gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and diarrhea could be early clues of coronavirus infection, according to a growing body of preliminary research.\n\nMissing those rarer symptoms could have deadly consequences, since they are sometimes the only early indicators that a person is infected. A peer-reviewed study published Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Association identified 14 coronavirus patients who had diarrhea and nausea before they showed any signs of fever or respiratory symptoms. That was 10% of the study's 138-person sample size.\n\nOne of those patients was placed in a surgical ward because they only showed abdominal symptoms, so doctors didn't suspect the new coronavirus. That patient then transmitted the virus to at least 10 healthcare workers and four other patients in the ward. (If you think you might have the coronavirus, call your doctor before leaving the house.)\n\nThe first US patient with the new coronavirus had diarrhea and reported abdominal discomfort the day after he arrived at the hospital, according to a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers later detected the coronavirus' RNA in his poop.\n\nAnother study, shared in the pre-publication repository biorXiv, detected an enzyme signature of the virus in cells from the small intestine and colon.\n\nPatients in China and Vietnam have also had diarrhea, vomited, or reported nausea.\n\nThese symptoms could be relatively rare, though: A study published in the pre-print repository medRxiv (which has not been peer-reviewed) looked at data from 1,099 patients. Less than 4% of those people experienced diarrhea and about 5% experienced vomiting.\n\nThese uncommon symptoms aren't emphasized in official guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But the agency's guidance for healthcare professionals does make a brief mention of diarrhea as an uncommonly reported symptom, along with \"a general feeling of being unwell.\"\n\nThis is not the first time scientists have found a coronavirus in patients' poop. Research indicated that SARS traveled through a Hong Kong apartment's sewage system to infect some residents after one sick person had diarrhea.\n\nDr. Susan Kline, a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, told MedPage Today that gastrointestinal symptoms were \"not unusual\" in SARS patients during the virus's deadly 2003 outbreak.\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus has killed more than 1,000 people -- a higher death toll in six weeks than SARS had in eight months.\n\nKline said that many illnesses cause nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting, even if those aren't the primary symptoms. Looking for them can be crucial in the early stages of a new outbreak, as it was with SARS and Ebola.\n\n\"It was not recognized early on that [Ebola] patients had prominent diarrhea. Later, as [there were] reports of large numbers of patients, it became more obvious that it could be a predominant part of the illness,\" Kline said.\n\nKline added that it's important not to assume that all patients will have gastrointestinal problems, though. Still, including those symptoms in official guidelines could help catch more coronavirus cases early on.\n\n\"That would be helpful for clinicians to have, so they could at least consider that a patient with novel coronavirus might have vomiting or diarrhea,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Some experts say that could happen  --  but it's not purely a good thing.", "body": "But even if the new coronavirus naturally subsides come spring, there virus could return in the winter.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an optimistic prediction about the novel coronavirus outbreak on Monday: \"A lot of people think that goes away in April, with the heat that comes in,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking with US governors at the White House about the coronavirus, the president added, \"I had a long talk with President Xi -- for the people in this room -- two nights ago, and he feels very confident. He feels that, again as I mentioned, by April or during the month of April, the heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus.\"\n\nSince the coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, China, in December, it has killed at least 1,000 people and infected more than 42,600 in 26 countries, including the US.\n\nTrump and Xi's hopes that the virus could taper off in the warmer months are not be off-base.\n\nAmesh Adalja, an infectious-disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, previously told Business Insider that the four coronaviruses that circulate in people -- viruses that cause mild colds -- have seasonality much like the flu.\n\nSo cases of the new virus \"may temper off as we leave spring and enter summer,\" Adalja said.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it would disappear forever. More likely, the virus could retreat in the spring and summer and return come fall and winter.\n\n\"If you look at the trajectory of the virus and how it's spreading in communities, coupled with the fact that we deal with coronaviruses every year during flu and cold season, those factors point to this coronavirus becoming a seasonal virus,\" Adalja said.\n\nTrump's comments on Monday echo a tweet the president posted on Friday after talking with President Xi.\n\n\"He feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of only days. Nothing is easy, but ... he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nLast week, S&P Global made a similar prediction, saying it expects the coronavirus outbreak will \"stabilize globally in April 2020, with virtually no new transmissions in May.\"\n\nIt added: \"Our worst-case projection holds that the virus stops spreading in late May, and optimistically in March.\"\n\nThe coronavirus, whose scientific name is 2019-nCoV, is a respiratory illness with pneumonialike symptoms. It spreads via coughing and close contact between people. The four other coronaviruses that are endemic -- meaning permanently present -- in the global human population all cause common colds, though each can cause pneumonia and death in rare instances.\n\nAccording to Adalja, the new virus could easily become a member of the club of constantly circulating, endemic coronaviruses.\n\n\"We have to be prepared for this to become the fifth community-acquired coronavirus,\" he said.\n\nThat means the virus would likely resurface again later in the year.\n\nThe flu virus \"survives better in cool, dry temperatures,\" Amanda Simanek, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, told Insider.\n\nIt's seasonal in this way because cooler temperatures help harden a protective gel-like coating that surrounds the virus while it's in the air. A stronger shell ensures it can survive long enough to travel from one person to the next.\n\nBut whereas the flu virus' genes change via a process called antigenic drift, coronaviruses are \"somewhat less prone to mutation than flu,\" Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, told Business Insider. (Each small mutation of the flu, on the other hand, gives rise to a new, closely related flu virus that our immune systems have to start fighting from scratch -- that's why flu vaccines aren't always 100% effective.)\n\nBut not all health experts agree that the coronavirus could weaken in April.\n\n\"It's a respiratory virus, and we know respiratory viruses are very seasonal, but not exclusively,\" William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, told CNN. \"One would hope that the gradual spring will help this virus recede. We can't be sure of that.\"\n\nOf Trump's remarks, he added: \"His hope is our hope. But we don't have knowledge that it will do that.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"body": "The CEO of MGA Entertainment, the maker of the popular LOL Surprise dolls, told Business Insider the coronavirus was a \"worldwide crisis\" and that the company was \"very concerned\" about its impact.\n\nAmazon reached out to a number of suppliers last week and placed last-minute orders to increase its inventory of products made in China, Business Insider has learned.\n\nThe company made the move to stockpile certain products shipped from China in anticipation of supply-chain slowdowns caused by the coronavirus outbreak in the region, according to Amazon suppliers who spoke with Business Insider. The virus that originated in Wuhan, China, has killed more than 900 people and infected over 40,000, causing work stoppages and factory closures in the country.\n\n\"Amazon issued off-cycle orders to you last night in order to prepare for possible supply chain disruptions due to recent global events originating in China,\" Amazon said in one of the emails viewed by Business Insider.\n\nAmazon told these suppliers the new orders were for products sold in the US but made in China and that the change was in response to the coronavirus outbreak. In one of the emails viewed by Business Insider, Amazon said it was placing \"stock-up purchase orders for several weeks of supply\" and giving the suppliers five extra days to ship the products to Amazon's warehouses. Amazon is also \"proactively waiving\" certain late-shipment fees, the emails said.\n\nThe move reflects the urgency Amazon is working with to mitigate the influence of the coronavirus on its supply chain. About 40% of Amazon's sales volume comes from these first-party wholesale suppliers, and many of them depend on Chinese factories to source their products. Amazon previously told Reuters the coronavirus was causing \"no interruptions\" to its operations.\n\nIn an emailed statement to Business Insider, Amazon's representative confirmed the order increase and said it was a cautionary move.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we are working with suppliers to secure additional inventory to ensure we maintain our selection for customers,\" the representative said.\n\nIt's not the only change Amazon has made in response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAmazon notified its third-party sellers last week that it was aware of the virus and its influence on \"millions of individuals around the world,\" according to a message to sellers seen by Business Insider. It said sellers should take precautions to make sure their sales performance is not affected by the virus. The recommended precautions include canceling previous orders that sellers are no longer able to deliver, placing their accounts in vacation status, and taking additional steps to manage inventory, the message said.\n\n\"We will consider this unforeseen event when we evaluate your account's recent performance,\" it said.\n\nAmazon also decided to pull out of this month's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, because of concerns over the spread of the virus, Reuters reported on Sunday. Amazon has made certain travel bans for employees going to China as well, Amazon's Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said last month during a call with reporters.\n\n\"We're watching it very carefully,\" Olsavsky said during the call, referring to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAmazon isn't the only company affected by the outbreak. Apple warned investors in January about losses because of Chinese suppliers shutting down, and Disney said theme-park closures in Shanghai and Hong Kong could reduce its profitability. Factories run by Tesla, Ford, and Nissan have also faced work stoppages because of the virus, according to The New York Times.\n\nIsaac Larian, the CEO of MGA Entertainment, which makes the popular LOL Surprise dolls, told Business Insider the coronavirus was a \"worldwide crisis\" disrupting every company's supply chain.\n\nHe said MGA, a first-party wholesale partner to Amazon, was also experiencing supply-chain disruptions because of the outbreak. Several toy factories in China, including the largest one in the country, extended their closure by another week after shutting down two weeks ago, he said.\n\n\"We are very concerned about our fall 2020 products manufacturing, as well as our plan for Easter toy sales,\" Larian told Business Insider. \"The damage from the coronavirus has already disrupted the supply chain.\"", "source": {"uri":

flight crews are exposed to significantly more people, given the amount of time they spend on planes.\n\n\"Aviation workers are always on the front line of any communicable disease,\" Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said. \"What's concerning about the coronavirus is that people who are infected and not yet displaying symptoms can spread the disease.\"\n\nAs

from China say 'it feels like I've been told I deserve this'", "body": "One student at Barnard College in New York posted on Instagram that she'd been chastised for not staying in her room, even though the only bathroom she has access to is a communal one.\n\nThere are no confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in New York, but at Barnard College, students say \"basic trust and privacy\" has been breaking down on campus, as frantic administrators aim to keep students who've returned from China in isolation, fearing the possibility of an outbreak.\n\nBarnard student Sylvia Su along with another, identified only as Cindy, told Columbia Student News' Bwog that they've never left their rooms for longer than a bathroom break during their two-week quarantines.\n\nSu has been being served two meals a day, including repetitive dinners of dry chicken and rice, while Cindy said the lunch and dinner rations were simply \"not enough\" and that she'd resorted to asking a friend to bring her more food. The undergrads are missing classes, and said sometimes their meals don't get delivered at all.\n\nLast week, Deputy Barnard Dean Natalie Friedman informed both students that she was \"very concerned that you are not staying in your room during this period of quarantine,\" after they were not present when someone showed up to deliver food.\n\nSu, who is originally from Beijing (a 12-hour drive from the Hubei province where the novel coronavirus originated) said she shares a bathroom with her hallmates, and that she may have been there to shower or use the toilet at the time her meal was delivered.\n\nSu later wrote in an Instagram story that the dean's message \"broke my heart,\" and that students have been treated \"inadequately and unimportantly\" in the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe school responded on Sunday with an updated message to all students that read: \"Barnard apologizes and regrets that an email went to two students suggesting there could be college disciplinary action for not being in their room. The College recognizes that the email was not accurate, appropriate, or acceptable.\"\n\nThe measures at Barnard appear to be more draconian than what's in place across the street at Columbia University. There, senior Mackinley Wang-Su told Bwog that he's also in a period of self-imposed isolation, but that he has left his suite to pick up food deliveries, go to a meeting, and mail some face masks to his parents in China.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary inconvenience to the students involved, and an act of selflessness as they do their part to keep our community and themselves safe and healthy,\" Barnard's Dean of the College Leslie Grinage wrote students in an email late on Thursday evening, after Su received and posted the email from Friedman.\n\nThe situation at Barnard is just one that school administrators have had to apologize for in recent weeks as fears and rumors about the novel coronavirus spread across the globe. At the University of California, Berkeley, the health center apologized last week for posting a now-deleted infographic that said xenophobia against \"those who might be from Asia\" was a \"common reaction\" to the outbreak.\n\n\"Confused and honestly very angry about this Instagram post from an official UC Berkeley Instagram account,\" UC Berkeley alumna Adrienne Shih tweeted. \"When is xenophobia ever a 'normal reaction?'\"\n\nMeanwhile, at schools where there have been actual cases of the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, in Massachussetts and Arizona, it's still \"business as usual\" for anyone who doesn't feel sick, as interim UMass Boston Chancellor Katherine Newman put it in a note to students, faculty, and staff.\n\nIt's not clear that quarantine measures could be effective at quelling a potential coronavirus outbreak if they include shared bathrooms, where germs could easily be exchanged. There's also no conclusive evidence yet that people can transmit the novel coronavirus before symptoms appear (Barnard said that none of the students under quarantine there have the common symptoms of the new virus, which include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.)\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending home isolation measures for travelers from mainland China, though the agency said that travelers from outside Hubei province are considered a \"medium\" risk, not \"high.\"\n\nBarnard said on Sunday that the self-imposed quarantines at that school were drawing to a close: of the 13 students who live on the campus who agreed to self-isolate, all but four have finished up their 14-day waiting period. It's possible that other Barnard students who were recently in China never notified the school about their recent travels in China at all.\n\n\"If you were doing this because you want to take responsibility for the whole community's health, yes, I think I would be more than willing to sacrifice my time, my schoolwork,\" Su told Bwog. \"Are you just doing this because you are imposed? Just doing this, sort of, almost as a showcase?\"\n\nSu has worked for the office of admissions at Barnard and previously encouraged other international students to apply to the school, writing in a post for prospective students that \"if you are looking for a place where you as an international student are supported, don't hesitate to apply to Barnard!\"\n\nBut her outlook seems to have changed in the wake of the school's strict quarantine measures.\n\n\"I don't feel or any support or any warmth from Barnard on this,\" she told Bwog. \"Personally, I feel like basically I've been told that I deserve this.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilary_brueck@businessinsider.com", "name": "Hilary Brueck", "type":

"The song, \"Corona Virus,\" by Dominican Dembow singer Yofrangel 911, was posted on YouTube on Sunday night, amassing 344,700 views on Twitter by Monday afternoon.\n\nIt begins with a hacking cough, and a chorus of fake sneezes, with the signature crown-shaped pathogens flying across the screen as Yofrangel convulses in the back of an ambulance, singing in Spanish about the virus, surrounded by people dressed as nurses and doctors.\n\nYofrangel tells listeners to \"t\u00e1pate la boca\" (cover your mouth) to not get other people sick. He also lists some of his \"symptoms\" -- an aching head, hand, and knee, none of which are actually associated with the coronavirus -- and seems to be getting an injection of a clear liquid, though there is no known treatment or vaccine.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms of the coronavirus include shortness of breath, coughing, and a fever.\n\nThe coronavirus is a delicate subject matter for an upbeat, jokey song, having infected over 40,500 people and killed more people than SARS.\n\nBut some begrudgingly found themselves taken by the tune. One Twitter user said: \"is it sad that it kinda bops.\"\n\nAnother Twitter user even wrote the song could be used to help educate people on the virus in a public service announcement by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio or the World Health Organization.\n\nBut not all commenters were impressed with the song, as one YouTube commenter wrote in Spanish they felt the song was disrespectful to people with the virus, \"this video is disrespectful to the people and businesses losing so much thanks to this virus.\"\n\nAnother YouTube commenter wrote, \"The number of infected people, the number of people who have died and they come and take it as a joke. God have mercy.\"\n\nDrugmakers are currently working on vaccines to help combat the spread of the virus, which has been found in over 25 countries since the first case was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.\n\nYoFrangel 911's song isn't the only song about the virus that has stirred controversy.\n\nA Dutch radio station released an apology on February 8 after it played a song blaming the spread of the coronavirus on Chinese people and Chinese food.\n\n\"We don't need the virus in our country, it is all caused by these stinking Chinese people,\" the rough translation of the song reads, according to Indy100.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, social media influencers have been posting \"Can You Hear the People Sing?\" -- a song from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables protesting the oppressive rule of the French monarchy, according to Mashable.\n\nThe subtle but controversial trend is an attempt to bring attention to the death of Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor responsible for bringing attention to the virus who some say was silenced by the government.\n\nWe're in an 'age of epidemics,' a scientist says. More diseases like the coronavirus will jump from animals to people.\n\nThe genetic code of the Wuhan coronavirus shows it's 80% similar to SARS. New research suggests a potential way to neutralize the virus.\n\nScientists have published over 50 studies on Wuhan coronavirus in the last 3 weeks. They learned that 75,800 people in Wuhan could be infected.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

it's a sign people aren't following advice to contain the virus", "body": "It's unlikely the driver could get the virus, but said the woman's actions went against advice by not calling an ambulance or using a private vehicle.\n\nThe first person confirmed to have the deadly coronavirus in London turned up unannounced at a hospital after taking an Uber there, health officials confirmed to The Guardian.\n\nThe unidentified patient, a woman who recently arrived from China, had \"self-presented\" herself to the A&E department at Lewisham hospital in the southeast of the city on Sunday, February 9, after falling ill.\n\nA public health body said the chances the Uber driver could have got the virus are low, and all staff who came into contact with the patient have been traced, with two members being sent home to be in isolation for a 14-day period.\n\nBut the hospital confirmed in an email published by The Guardian that the woman ignored public health officials' advice by not arriving in an ambulance or in her own private vehicle. She also did not call the NHS 111 advice service, which has been recommended to those who think they are developing symptoms of the virus.\n\nThe woman was sent home pending the results of her test before being taken to another hospital in London, St Thomas', for treatment on Wednesday, Sky News reported. The woman is the first recorded case of coronavirus in London.\n\nBen Travis, the chief executive of branch of the National Health Service (NHS) trust that covers Lewisham, described what happened to the patient in a message to staff published by The Guardian.\n\n\"In this case, the patient self-presented at our A&E. As soon as the patient did this, the patient was given a mask and then escorted to be tested in the dedicated area we have assigned for coronavirus testing outside the A&E building - while awaiting the installation of a purpose-built 'pod'.\n\n\"As further assessment was required, the patient was then taken to a dedicated isolation room in the emergency department. In line with our protocols, throughout their care the patient was escorted and did not come into contact with other patients. The patient was later discharged and taken home by London ambulance service.\"\n\nUber said it \"temporarily suspended\" the account of the driver who transported the individual to the hospital.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson told Business Insider: \"We received a request from Public Health England for information about a passenger who has now been confirmed as having coronavirus.\n\n\"We have dedicated an online portal for public health authorities to contact Uber for information about riders and drivers, and we will take action on any user accounts on the recommendation of those authorities.\"\n\nPublic Health England, the national body that sets healthcare policy in the UK, said that the Uber driver had little chance of contracting the infection because he was not with the woman long enough, according to The Guardian. The journey was less than 15 minutes.\n\nBut healthcare professionals are still critical of the move as one that does not follow advice.\n\nThe chair of the Royal College of Nursing's Emergency Care Association, Dave Smith, told The Guardian: \"It's worrying to hear that the public isn't following Public Health England advice about phoning NHS 111 to seek advice, and therefore putting other members of the public and NHS staff at risk of contracting coronavirus.\"\n\nA total of nine people in the UK are now being treated for COVID-19. Two inmates at a prison in Oxfordshire, England, were tested for the Wuhan coronavirus on Tuesday.\n\nFor the latest case total, death toll, and travel information, you can follow Business Insider's

I do know that apparently more and more people are suffering over there,\" Kudlow said, according to The Guardian. \"Is the Politburo really being honest with us?\"\n\nThe virus, which emerged in the city of Wuhan in December, has now killed at least 1,380 people and infected more than 63,000 people in China alone, according to government figures.\n\nSuspicion has swirled over how China has responded to the virus and how it complies its figures, recently heightened by the way some authorities have changed their reporting methods.\n\nThe number of new cases jumped by 15,000 on Thursday, making it the largest single-day increase since the outbreak began.\n\nKudlow also referenced the change in figures on Thursday, saying according to Reuters: \"These numbers are jumping around. ... There was some surprise.\"\n\nThe director of the US Centers for Disease Control also said the agency had offered to help China with the virus as early as January 6, but has not heard back.\n\nDr. Robert Redfield told CNN Wednesday: \"There's a lot of information we don't know - that's why I offered to provide assistance, direct assistance, and send our CDC folks over there back on January 6 to really help them gather that information and also to help us see the information first hand that we need to help make the right public health recommendations for our nation.\"\n\n\"That letter has not been responded to yet by the official Chinese government,\" he said.\n\n\"We do believe that we're the best in the world in this space and we're ready to help and assist them, but they're an independent nation that has to make that decision that they're going to invite us in.\"\n\nThe coronavirus, which has spread to at least 25 other countries, has become an international crisis.\n\nThe figures being reported by China had already been treated with suspicion for weeks after multiple researchers suggested the number of infected should be much higher.\n\nThese doubts were heightened on Thursday after Hubei province - which is home to Wuhan - changed its method of diagnosis to include people who were found to have signs of pneumonia during CT scans.\n\nThis caused 15,000 new cases to be recorded within 24 hours - becoming the largest single-day jump in cases since the outbreak began.\n\nAnd on Friday, China's National Health Commission said it had removed 108 people from the death count \"because of duplicated Hubei province statistics,\" according to a translation by CNBC.\n\nAnother unnamed Chinese province near Russia also cut its number of confirmed cases earlier this week, deciding that people who tested positive for the coronavirus but did not show symptoms did not count, according to The New York Times.\n\nThese revisions come as part of China's medical systems become overwhelmed and some areas report a shortage of virus-testing kits.\n\nMultiple studies have also suggested that the number of infected should be much higher. They include:\n\nChinese authorities also targeted medical professionals and journalists who warned about the virus in its early days.\n\nKerry Brown, a China expert at King's College, London, told The New York Times after Hubei province shared its diagnosis method that \"It's pretty clear that there is an issue with trust about whatever the Chinese government comes out with at the moment.\"\n\n\"That may be terribly unfair,\" he said. But \"to redefine things - even legitimately - at a moment like this is always going to be a presentational challenge, because people are going to be very sensitive, and they're going to suspect there's another agenda.\"\n\nHowever, the World Health Organization (WHO) has praised China's relative transparency and efforts to fight the coronavirus spread. It said last month that China had agreed to allow global health experts into the country, and the organization has send also sent a delegation to the country.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said in January: \"We appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak, especially the commitment from top leadership, and the transparency they have demonstrated, including sharing data and genetic sequence of the virus.\"\n\nChina has also shared the draft genome of the coronavirus, allowing it to be studied with researchers around the world.\n\nIts response to the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak has been deemed far more open compared to its response to the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. China tried to cover up and deny that outbreak, which went on to kill more than 770 people around the world.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business

pandemic bonds, which have $425 million hinging on how deadly the coronavirus ends up being", "body": "The bonds' triggers \"are very late,\" and the organization could've funded relief efforts without the \"unnecessary, inappropriate, and ineffective risk-financing instruments,\" Olga Jonas, senior fellow senior fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, told Business Insider.\n\nA group of unique bondholders will either reap massive profits or lose hundreds of millions of dollars as the coronavirus outbreak escalates.\n\nSo-called \"pandemic bonds\" were first introduced by the World Bank in 2017 as a response to the Ebola virus. Investors holding the bonds enjoy higher-than-average interest rates, but stand to lose their cash in the event of a pandemic.\n\nIf certain criteria are met, the bonds' principal is transferred to the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) to fund containment and relief efforts.\n\n\"We are leveraging our capital market expertise, our deep understanding of the health sector, our experience overcoming development challenges, and our strong relationships with donors and the insurance industry to serve the world's poorest people,\" Jim Yong Kim, World Bank Group's president, said in a 2017 statement, adding that the PEF can \"potentially save millions of lives.\"\n\nThe bank issued two tranches of pandemic-linked bonds and derivatives collectively worth $425 million in 2017. Bondholders enjoyed more than two years of strong returns and little to worry about as few outbreaks came close to triggering the bonds' total default.\n\nBut the stability of the investment has suddenly been thrown into question as the deadly coronavirus spreads globally.\n\nThe two tranches of pandemic bonds represent different risks of contagion. The World Bank offered $225 million worth of Class A debt, which pay out 6.9% annually. The bonds default if pandemic-related deaths reach 2,500 in a single nation with an additional 20 or more deaths confirmed in an overseas country, according to the bank's prospectus.\n\nThe Class B bonds have a lower bar for the debt to trigger and accordingly boast a higher interest rate, since holders are assuming more risk. The bonds pay 11.5% annually, but reach default after 250 deaths. The bonds' payout rate scales with the number of additional countries that experience than 20 confirmed deaths. The World Bank issued $95 million worth of the Class B assets.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has so far killed more than 1,370 people and infected more than 60,000, surpassing SARS in lethality earlier this month. Still, Singapore, Thailand, Japan, and Korea are the only nations currently hosting more than 20 infected individuals.\n\nWhile the World Bank touts the debt as an efficient way to connect financial markets with epidemic relief, others have their doubts that the bonds help ailing nations at all. The assets' lengthy prospectus hides numerous requirements that gum up any effort to release funds when they're most needed, according to Olga Jonas, senior fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health and former World Bank economist.\n\nFunds can only be released from the PEF for non-flu epidemics 12 weeks after the \"start of the event,\" according to a World Bank document. The novel coronavirus strains were first reported on in late December, leaving funds locked up until late March.\n\nRead more: A Wall Street firm lists its 5 best hedges for an unusual coronavirus-driven market crash -- and shares what to do if it's successfully contained\n\nEven once the deadline is met, the outbreak has to cause at least 20 deaths in two or more countries to trigger the bonds. While China reached the fatality threshold weeks ago, no other nation is close, leaving the PEF frozen while the virus continues to spread.\n\n\"The advertising was that there would be early, rapid, predictable, transparent financing available for outbreaks so that they don't become pandemics,\" Jonas told Business Insider in an interview. \"In order for that to happen you have to have early triggers. The triggers in the design are very late.\"\n\nJonas alleges that the World Bank didn't even need to issue bonds to better prevent pandemics. The former economist called the instruments a \"distraction\" from \"getting serious about supporting preparedness\" in developing countries. The $500 million made available through the PEF is a paltry sum compared to the tens of billions of dollars the World Bank holds in liquid assets, she added.\n\n\"The money on the table from [the World Bank's International Development Association] didn't need to transit the PEF -- and it certainly should not be paying for an unnecessary, inappropriate, and ineffective risk-financing instrument,\" Jonas said.\n\nShe added: \"If you were doing this with your own money at home, that'd be grounds for divorce.\"\n\nEven in the case of the bonds being triggered, Jonas doesn't expect the funds to do much good. The PEF's insurance window covers up to $500 million through its bond and swap issuances, but allocates only as much as $196 million for coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nOnce released, 76 countries can apply to receive the pandemic relief funds, watering down the total amount sent to each country. Compared to the $10 billion China is spending on virus control today, the amounts that could be released by the PEF are \"trivial,\" Jonas said.\n\nThe bonds would've been useful \"if you are not able to finance the risk otherwise,\" she added. \"The World Bank has excellent capacity to finance the risk otherwise.\"\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business

virus outbreak, but how likely it is that furry friends will be infected with the virus is still unclear.\n\nWhile the World Health Organization has previously stated that there is no evidence that would suggest pets are likely to catch the novel coronavirus, one Chinese expert says they can, Newsweek reported.\n\nLi Lanjuan, an epidemiologist was quoted in the China Daily, a state-run English-language newspaper, warning the public to keep their pets away from infected individuals. Her remarks were made in an interview with China Central Television last month.\n\nThe China Daily reported Lanjuan said: \"If pets go out and have contact with an infected person, they have the chance to get infected. By then, pets need to be isolated. In addition to people, we should be careful with other mammals especially pets.\"\n\nHowever, the World Health Organization said there is currently no evidence that suggests pets could get the new COVID-19 virus. They did recommend that people wash their hands after contact with their pets since bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella can be transmitted between furry friends and humans.\n\nRobert Kim-Farley, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, told Business Insider while it may be possible for the virus - which researchers believe jumped from animals to humans - to spread to pets, there is no evidence to suggest it will at this point in time.\n\nWhile dogs are capable of contracting some coronavirus strains such as the canine respiratory coronavirus, the American Kennel Association said this new coronavirus does not appear to be a threat to your four legged friends.\n\nDespite that, people, especially in China are still rushing to get masks for their cats and dogs. Zhou Tianxiao, who sells dog face masks, told the Daily Mail that his sales increased from 150 a month to 50 a day.\n\nUSA Today reported that some companies are running out of masks. Kirby Holmes, owner and CEO of K9 Mask told USA Today that they've filled orders from Wuhan and have seen a 300 to 400% increase increase in business.\n\n\"We would usually average five to 10 units a day. We've sold 110 to 130 units in just the past few days,\" Holmes told USA Today.\n\nIt's not just dogs that owner want to protect. Many images of cats wearing makeshift face masks have circulated online.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

performance", "body": "To get this story plus others to your inbox each day, hours before they're published on Business Insider, click here.\n\nThe e-tailer announced that its core commerce segment brought in $20.3 billion in its fiscal Q3 2020 (ended December 31, 2019) -- outperforming its recent high of $15 billion from the comparable quarter the year prior.\n\nThe segment, which includes Alibaba's retail business in China and abroad as well as related services like logistics and customer management, accounted for 88% of the firm's total revenue and grew 38% year-over-year (YoY), matching Alibaba's overall annual revenue growth for the quarter.\n\nThis does represent a slight deceleration from the 40% YoY increase the firm posted last quarter and in the comparable period the year prior -- but given the immense amount of revenue it brings in during its fiscal Q3 because of Singles' Day, its tentpole sales holiday, 38% annual growth is still impressive.\n\nThe e-tailer's performance on Singles' Day and its continued innovation appear to be key drivers of its performance.\n\nAlibaba expanded Singles' Day's reach in 2019, further establishing it as the biggest global e-commerce sales day and as a major event for the company. Alibaba brought in $38.4 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) during the annual sales event, which takes place on November 11.\n\nAlthough other merchants and marketplaces also take advantage of the event, Alibaba has been able to lead the way because it pioneered Singles' Day, leading its sales during the event to dwarf e-commerce revenue from Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And Alibaba is still growing the event: Its GMV rose 26% YoY and over 200,000 brands, including 22,000 international brands, took part in it. So, Singles' Day may be a driving force behind Alibaba's success in the years to come as more merchants and consumers join in.\n\nThe company is also developing new features that are likely helping its performance and could set it up for future success. Taobao Live, which sees merchants and \"key opinion leaders\" use a live broadcast to market to consumers, saw its GMV and monthly active users increase 100% YoY in December 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba also debuted a new delivery service from Sun Art Retail Group, which Alibaba previously invested in, to offer consumers speedy delivery for food and other products. By growing and launching new channels for sales, Alibaba may be able to continue growing its retail business at a fast pace.\n\nDespite Alibaba's promising performance, the coronavirus outbreak in China could weaken its sales in the short term. Issues like limited delivery capacity and closed restaurants that are a result of the outbreak are expected to impact parts of Alibaba's business, per Reuters.\n\nThese problems won't necessarily damage the e-tailer's long-term prospects, but they could depress Alibaba's retail performance in the next few quarters as it works to raise up its delivery capabilities and selection to its normal levels. And Alibaba isn't alone in potentially facing fewer sales because of the outbreak: Merchants like Starbucks' businesses in China are also at risk, as are firms that rely on demand from Chinese tourists.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_keyes@businessinsider.com", "name": "Daniel Keyes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singles'_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singles' Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alibaba Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Monday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyber Monday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Friday (shopping)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taobao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Salesmanship", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Salesmanship", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Consulting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Education and Training", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e46ad382dae5c74146267e4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5513883", "location": null, "shares": {}, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1447936500", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-02-14", "time": "16:07:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-14T16:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-14T16:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/china-economy-expected-slow-worst-pace-since-financial-crisis-poll-2020-2", "title": "China's economy is expected to slow to worst pace since financial crisis as coronavirus spreads", "body": "A deadly viral outbreak is dragging on activity in China and throughout the world.

After the outbreak, mask prices shot up by 50% to 100% online, she said, before the government controlled prices. Even products to make home-made hand sanitizer have increased, Opas said.\n\n\"The impact to normal business will depend on how soon the virus outbreak is controlled worldwide as the Thailand economy depends largely on tourism,\" she added.\n\nIn Japan, a Tokyo-based programmer for a major company told Business Insider his pay has not been impacted at all after coronavirus. The software developer's company encouraged workers to work from home, but he said his team finds it better to take shifts coming into the office to lessen the disease's spread.\n\nAcross Asia, white-collar professionals like the programmer in Tokyo have seen less impacts to their pay from the coronavirus outbreak than blue-collar workers such as Opas. As coronavirus enters its third month and deaths surge past 1,300 as of February 13, low-wage and small business workers across East and Southeast Asia have worried about paying their bills and keeping their jobs. Professionals employed by larger companies have, for the most part, more job security and flexibility to work from home.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with five workers in East and Southeast Asia who had been impacted by coronavirus. Most requested anonymity due to fear they would lose their jobs or clients. We confirmed their identities prior to publishing.\n\nThe coronavirus first spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December. Since the initial outbreak, more than 1,000 people have died in China, and deaths have also been reported in the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Japan as of February 13, with as many as 60,000 infections reported as far afield as the US and parts of the EU.\n\nThe sudden outbreak upended work around East and Southeast Asia. Many businesses closed following the Chinese New Year holiday in late January, and companies mandated work-from-home schedules. China's efforts to protect workers from getting sick have included a 10-day extension of the Lunar New Year holiday that kept shops and businesses closed for longer.\n\nCoronavirus spurred an unprecedented \"work from home\" experiment for many white-collar employees in finance, tech, and law, Bloomberg reported. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that working from home inhibits viruses from spreading.\n\nOffice buildings also installed temperature readers for everyone entering. Kseniya Otmakhova, a PR director in Beijing, shared photos of an extensive temperature screening process outside her office on LinkedIn. She said while some may find the protocol \"extreme,\" she appreciates the proactive approach to preventing an outbreak.\n\nBut for small business and low-wage workers, not going to work meant losing pay.\n\nOpas, for instance, operated her business as usual without taking any time off, and she told her staff to wear gloves and masks, and to wash their hands between massage sessions. Sarah Lev, a freelance tour guide in Singapore, said travel agencies only hired her on five days for all of January, and she has yet to get booked in February.\n\nVulnerable small businesses have already begun laying off hundreds of employees in China, according to the South China Morning Post. Some business owners stranded outside of Hong Kong due to the travel ban instituted by the Philippines told Business Insider that they fear losing weeks of revenue and even missing their rent payments because of the loss of clients and some employees' inability to work.\n\nA domestic worker in Hong Kong, who asked to stay anonymous, said she had already lost her job cleaning for a family. The worker said she has been unable to get to Hong Kong due to the Philippines' travel restriction, so hasn't been paid for more than two weeks.\n\n\"The experience of losing a job and not having a job to go back to affected me very much because it seems like I have to start from square one again,\" the worker said. \"I can't say my position is different from other professionals because we're all working for money to support our families.\"\n\nWhere government protections on sick leave are lacking, a phenomenon called \"presenteeism\" occurs, where vulnerable workers feel pressured to go into work to make money, even while sick.\n\nMarissa Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Washington Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences department, told Business Insider that coming into work with any illness poses a public health risk for other people in the community.\n\n\"I can't say coronavirus is being spread faster because of of presenteeism, but it is a consideration,\" Baker said. \"Presenteeism has been shown to cause other workplace epidemics.\"\n\nThe picture emerging on the ground of the coronavirus outbreak in East and Southeast Asia is of white-collar businesses taking steps to help their employees and reduce changes of a further outbreak.

Just 7% mentioned the coronavirus when asked to explain their economic expectations in early February, according to the survey.\n\nAmericans also appeared unfazed as the 2020 campaign season heated up. About 10% of all consumers mentioned \"some aspect of the election as having a potential impact on their economic expectations,\" the survey said.\n\n\"These gains in consumers' economic assessments have also been accompanied by a faint stirring of two powerful sources of uncertainty,\" said Richard Curtin, the chief economist of the survey.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Durable good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Family_and_Consumer_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Family and Consumer Science", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/b2c234627a1fa00a2aa6f05e5f6302fb7fbe26ff.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {}, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1447996413", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-02-14", "time": "17:07:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-14T17:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-14T17:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/vietnam-company-using-toilet-paper-for-coronavirus-masks-faces-penalty-2020-2", "title": "A company in Vietnam has been making masks out of toilet paper amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Face-mask demand has surged and production is up after authorities said the country needs to produce 10 million masks per day.\n\nAs face-mask demand surges amid the novel coronavirus outbreak, officials in Hanoi, Vietnam, discovered a company producing face masks partially out of toilet paper.\n\nOfficials learned on Wednesday that Viet Han Company Ltd was using large toilet paper rolls at its factory in the city.\n\nThe material was used to replace an antibacterial layer usually found in masks, said Hoang Dai Nghia, chief of Team 1 at the Hanoi Market Surveillance Agency.\n\nHoang told the Vietnam Express that Viet Han Company sought to profit off the COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 63,000 people in China and killed at least 1,380. Sixteen cases have been confirmed in Vietnam.\n\n\"This company is cheating consumers amid the novel coronavirus outbreak,\" he said, adding that the company's stock was confiscated and the agency is considering the highest penalties possible.\n\nViet Han Company is a printing and napkin company. It is not registered as a producer of medical supplies.\n\nPrior to the discovery, authorities seized some 140,000 masks, many of which used toilet paper, and were searching for the manufacturers.\n\nAuthorities have advised that producers of poor-quality and imitation products will face heavy fines, the Saigon Times reported. Since early February, officials have found more than 4,200 violations related to face-mask production.\n\nFace masks are actually most useful to individuals who already have an illness. They prevent sick people from spreading the infection to others, but do not necessarily protect the healthy, according to researchers. The World Health Organization says other measures -- like washing one's hands, using tissues to cough or sneeze, and maintaining a three-foot distance from others -- could do more to help people stay healthy.\n\nAnd yet around the country, demand for the masks has skyrocketed. Vietnam's Ministry of Health recently advised that the country needs to produce 10 million masks per day.\n\nSince then, \"textiles business, including several with no prior experience, have begun producing antibacterial masks,\" wrote Vietnam Express journalist Anh Minh.\n\nAnd employees on the production lines are working overtime to meet demand.\n\n\"Most of us are doing an extra half-shift of overtime every day,\" one worker at Dong Xuan Knitting Company told Vietnam Express. \"Because we make more money, everyone is happy and trying to take advantage of the situation.\"\n\nThe director of the company, Tran Viet, said Dong Xuan is producing up to eight tons of antibacterial fabric daily, enough for roughly 300,000 masks.\n\n\"We are working every hour to improve productivity,\" he said. \"After it stabilizes, we will see if we can serve orders in other epidemic-affected areas if needed.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaac_scher@businessinsider.com", "name": "Isaac Scher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_paper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toilet paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VnExpress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "VnExpress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Produce", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Produce", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e46d2b7e0e14466211ee9b4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {}, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1447083051", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-14", "time": "00:35:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-14T00:35:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-14T00:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/china-coronavirus-diagnosis-ct-scans-lungs-2020-2", "title": "China is diagnosing coronavirus patients by looking for 'ground glass' in their lungs. Take a look at the CT scans.", "body": "To diagnose the virus, physicians look for white patches called \"ground glass,\" which signal fluid in the lungs.\n\nAuthorities in China's Hubei province reported a dramatic spike in coronavirus cases on Thursday: 14,840 new cases.\n\nIt was most reported in a single day since the outbreak began in December. The Hubei Health Commission also reported that an additional 242 people had died.\n\nBut the virus didn't suddenly becoming more aggressive - instead, Hubei officials said they changed the way they count cases. Rather than relying only on blood tests, which are in limited supply and can take take days to yield results, officials have started including diagnoses made via CT scans in their daily case totals.\n\nThe scans are considered less thorough than a blood test, but the New York Times reported last week that doctors in Wuhan, where the virus originated, are running short on test kits.\n\nPatients diagnosed via CT scan - what Chinese officials call \"clinically diagnosed cases\" - present symptoms of the virus in their lungs, but either haven't been lab-tested or died before the test could be administered.\n\nThe latest figures suggest the virus has killed at least 1,370 people and infected more than 60,000 in total. That number is expected to rise significantly as CT scans capture more cases in the coming days.\n\nIt's common to have small masses of tissue, or lung nodules, that show up as tiny white dots.\n\n\"It kind of looks like faint glass that has been ground up,\" Paras Lakhani, a radiologist at Thomas Jefferson University, told Business Insider. \"What it represents is fluid in the lung spaces.\"\n\nOn its own, Lakhani said, ground glass isn't particularly helpful for identifying a coronavirus.\n\n\"You can see it with all types of infections - bacterial, viral, or sometimes even non-infectious causes,\" Lakhani said. \"Even vaping could sometimes appear this way.\"\n\nBut the patches are significant, he added, when they extend to the edges of the patient's lungs.\n\n\"That's something we don't often see,\" Lakhani said. \"We saw that with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and we saw that with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\"\n\nBoth SARS and MERS are also coronaviruses. An outbreak of the former in China resulted in 8,000 cases and 774 deaths from November 2002 to July 2003.\n\nResearchers analyzed scans from patients at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, the majority of whom were older men with preexisting health problems. The images above are scans from a 52-year-old patient.\n\nThe first group of scans (group A) were taken on January 7, five days after the patient started displaying symptoms. They show patches of ground glass at the bottom of both lungs.\n\nThe man was put on life support from January 7 to 12. After that, his condition seemed to improve. The second set of scans (group B), taken January 21, show that many of the white patches either shrunk or disappeared.\n\nA 33-year-old woman arrived at a hospital in Lanzhou, China with a fever and five-day-old cough. Her temperature was 102 degrees Fahrenheit, her breathing was \"coarse,\" and she had a low white blood cell count - a sign of infection.\n\nIn an initial CT scan, researchers at the First Hospital of Lanzhou University found the recognizable white ground-glass patches in the lower corner of her lungs.\n\nThey gave her a protein used to treat viral infections, called interferon. But three days later - and further into her treatment - the patches were more pronounced. Lakhani said the same thing occurred in SARS patients.\n\n\"If you didn't know about this outbreak, you'd read the scan and you would just say, 'Okay, this patient has pneumonia,' because that's the most common thing we see,\" he said.\n\nBut Lakhani added that \"pneumonia usually doesn't rapidly progress,\" so it could be ruled out in this case.\n\nResearchers at Anhui Medical University in Hefei, China examined the woman after she was admitted for a fever and cough. Her breathing was also coarse. The \"ground-glass halo\" they found can be a distinguishing feature of viral infections and pneumonia, the researchers said.\n\nAfter four days in the hospital, the nodule on the patient's right lung had grown.\n\nA study of 21 patients across three Chinese provinces found four patients with a \"crazy-paving pattern\" in their scans.\n\n\"It almost looks like a cobblestone road,\" Lakhani said. \"Sometimes when we see it, it's everywhere - the whole lung has it. But to see it in a few small areas is a little less common, a little more unusual.\"\n\nThe pattern has also appeared in some SARS and MERS scans, he said.\n\nAnother study of patients who recovered from the coronavirus suggested that crazy-paving could be common among patients with milder cases.\n\nResearchers at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center analyzed this patient's scan three days after the man was admitted to the hospital. In addition to ground glass, it shows a web-like \"reticulation\" pattern - a sign of lung damage commonly associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nA recent study in The Lancet found that the coronavirus can lead to ARDS, which is often fatal.\n\nAccording to the Shanghai researchers, 22% of the 50 patients they looked at displayed reticulation on their scans. Around 77% had ground-glass patches, while nearly 60% had consolidation - lung tissue that filled with liquid instead of air.\n\n\"We can't rely on CT alone to fully exclude presence of the virus,\" Michael Chung, the lead author of the Lanzhou study, said on February 3.\n\nLakhani said CT scans are \"one of four or five things\" needed to make a diagnosis, along with symptoms, clinical history, the progression of the disease, and the laboratory test.\n\nPhotos from inside the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where thousands of passengers have been quarantined for a week because of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe US has confirmed 15 cases of the coronavirus across 7 states.

finally be allowed off after 25 days aboard  --  but elders get first dibs", "body": "Some passengers have already decided they'd rather stay on board the ship, where alcohol supplies are dwindling, but food offerings are more diverse.\n\nThere's only one place outside of mainland China where more than a few dozen cases of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 have been diagnosed.\n\nIt's a cruise ship.\n\nAt least 218 people aboard the Diamond Princess have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. That's far more diagnoses than any other country outside mainland China, where more than 60,000 people are sick, and more than 1,300 have died. Authorities suspect the outbreak originated when a man from Hong Kong boarded the ship for an earlier leg of the journey, then disembarked and was diagnosed.\n\n\"We clearly have a large number of cases in a very closed environment on that ship,\" Michael Ryan, Executive Director of the World Health Organization Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters on Thursday.\n\nThe ship, which is now carrying roughly 3,500 passengers and crew, has been on a 14-day lockdown since it was originally scheduled to dock in Japan on February 4.\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of Heath had previously been letting sick passengers with positive COVID-19 tests off the boat for care, but now some of the oldest, frailest individuals who are not sick will have the option to get off the waves too.\n\nSoon, any passengers who are over 80 years old and staying in the interior, balcony-less cabin rooms, as well as anyone over 80 with a chronic medical issue, will be able to disembark, if they want to, the Japanese health ministry announced.\n\n\"It's a difficult thing for anybody to live in a closed environment like that, it's particularly difficult for an elderly person to do so,\" Ryan said. \"We are working with Japan to try and get the most needy passengers off the ship.\"\n\nPeople who want to leave the ship will first be tested for the novel coronavirus. If their test comes back negative, they'll be housed in \"individual rooms\" with \"individual bathrooms\" on shore until the end of the quarantine period, but they will not necessarily be offered all the same food and entertainment that exists aboard the cruise ship.\n\n\"The meals provided will be Japanese bento-style boxes,\" the Japanese health authority made clear. \"No Western meals will be available.\"\n\n\"Maybe that would be okay for those escaping an interior cabin, but for our part, we'll stay right where we are,\" one passenger wrote on Twitter.\n\nFood reviews on board the Diamond Princess appear generally positive, but there have been some complaints about moldy broccoli and dwindling liquor supplies on the ship lately. (One couple reportedly got a wine delivery by drone.)\n\nThe Valentine's Day dinner menu on the ship will include \"cupid's avocado and shrimp salad\" along with three separate entree options, including a choice between coq au vin and a \"shrimp valentine Japanese style.\"\n\nConditions are still cramped, especially for people relegated to the windowless interior cabins, no larger than a shipping container. Even those who've been in close contact with people who've been diagnosed with the coronavirus are not allowed to get off.\n\nPassengers are now being allotted an hour a day to escape their rooms and walk around on deck to get some fresh air, but they are asked to keep a safe distance from others, and wear masks when they go out. Guests have also been offered extra internet bandwidth to pass the time, eight new TV channels, daily Sudoku puzzles, and mental health phone counseling services.\n\nSome are working remotely from the ship during their extra two weeks in the port of Yokohama, while others have taken to doing their laundry out on the balconies - as the wait for garment cleaning on the ship can be as long as 72 hours.\n\nThe 14-day quarantine is scheduled to end on Wednesday, February 19. By then, any remaining guests will have been on the ship for about a month.\n\n\"Another day's done, and we are one step closer to the end of our extended time together,\" a crewmember announced from the bridge of the ship on Thursday evening. \"We truly understand that some must be very anxious ... we only have six days to go. Goodnight.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilary_brueck@businessinsider.com", "name": "Hilary Brueck", "type":

could take up to 24 days after exposure for symptoms to show", "body": "The coronavirus outbreak that originated in Wuhan, China, has killed at least 1,370 people and infected more than 60,000 people. New research from a group of Chinese scientists suggested the virus' incubation period - the time between exposure and the onset of symptoms - could be as long as 24 days. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the coronavirus' incubation period is two days to two weeks. Based on that estimate, the CDC instituted a 14-day federal quarantine for the US citizens evacuated from Wuhan. The new study raises doubts about whether that period is sufficient. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, in December has infected more than 60,000 people and spread to 25 other countries.\n\nAs researchers race to learn more about the virus, a crucial question lingers: How much time passes between when a person gets infected and when their first symptoms appear?\n\n\"Every day there are new estimates coming out for the incubation period,\" Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin, told Business Insider.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the incubation period is believed to be two to 14 days.\n\nBut new research from a group of Chinese scientists led by Zhong Nanshan, who discovered the SARS virus, suggests it might take as long as 24 days for a person to start showing symptoms after being exposed to the novel coronavirus. The study examined 1,099 coronavirus cases from 522 hospitals across 31 provinces in China, making it the largest coronavirus case study to date, though it has not yet been peer-reviewed.\n\nMeyers said uncertainty about the incubation period \"is particularly relevant when you're thinking about how long you actually have to monitor people to make sure that they're not infected.\"\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Ga je in aandelen beleggen of koop je een huis om te verhuren en word je 'huisjesmelker'? 7 dingen om goed op te letten\n\nSo far, the US and many other countries have been formulating quarantine rules based on a 14-day incubation period.\n\nUS citizens evacuated from Wuhan were brought to military bases in nine states, including California and Texas, where they were put under a mandatory 14-day quarantine. On Tuesday, 195 of those evacuees were permitted to leave the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, marking the first successful US quarantine in nearly 60 years.\n\nThe UK, Australia, France, India, Italy, and Canada have also said that citizens repatriated from Wuhan will be quarantined for 14 days. And on Monday, the UK government announced measures allowing for a mandatory 14-day quarantine of coronavirus patients.\n\n\"It's widely accepted that there's a 14-day rule of thumb,\" Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, told Business Insider. \"That's how long you have to wait to go back to your daily life.\"\n\nBut if this new study is correct, 14 days may not be sufficient.\n\nIs a 14-day quarantine long enough?\n\nFoto: A security official stands guard as an ambulance arrives with a patient at Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong on January 22.sourceAnthony Kwan/Getty Images\n\nIn the new study from Zhong's team, the median age of patients was 47 and the median incubation period was three days, though the full range of incubation periods in the study was zero to 24 days.\n\nCDC officials said they were confident that the 195 evacuees' two-week isolation was sufficient.\n\n\"The incubation period is obviously really important for us as we look to make sure that we're releasing these people safely from quarantine,\" Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Wednesday press briefing.\n\n\"We still think that for today, for now, 14 days is the right interval to use,\" she added.\n\nFoto: Dozens of US citizens who were evacuated from Wuhan throw their face masks after their quarantine ended in California on Tuesday.sourceRiverside County Department of Public Health\n\nMichael Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization's health-emergencies program, said this week that the WHO was also \"not considering changing anything\" about its quarantine recommendations.\n\nPinpointing the incubation period is difficult and important\n\nIdentifying a virus' incubation period is critical for modeling its spread.\n\n\"It gives you an idea of how quickly the virus could propagate, if you want to project how many patients you're going to see,\" Morse said.\n\nMorse added that there were a few reasons to be skeptical of the 24-day estimate in the new study. \"Was this one patient or a significant number that experienced a 24-day incubation period?\" he said.\n\nThe research didn't specify how many patients had incubation periods longer than two weeks.\n\nFoto: Medical staff members who took over a large temporary hospital built in an exhibition center in Wuhan.sourceFeature China/Barcroft Media via Getty Images\n\nWhat's more, Morse said, the 24-day figure could have been based on inexact data.\n\n\"These are largely patients who have been found through hospitalization,\" he said. \"So we don't know how long they've had the virus based on when they went to hospital. We have to rely on their memory of when they were exposed, which may or may not be accurate.\"\n\nMorse also questioned the lower end of the incubation-period range in the study.\n\n\"Zero days makes me suspect - does that mean patients are developing symptoms the same day as contact?\" he said. \"One to two days I can accept, but less than 24 hours seems extreme.\"\n\nRyan mentioned another possible explanation for the longer-than-expected incubation period in the study.\n\n\"A very long incubation period can reflect a double exposure,\" he said.\n\nRead more about the novel coronavirus: Everything we know about the deadly Wuhan virus sweeping across China Photos from inside the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where thousands of passengers have been quarantined for a week because of the coronavirus outbreak Cruise ships, detention centers, seaside resorts, and motels: Photos show how travelers are being quarantined due to the coronavirus There's a good chance the Wuhan coronavirus will never disappear, experts say.

and halts spending in China amid coronavirus fears", "body": "Gucci, which is Kering's biggest brand and brings in 83% of the conglomerate's recurring operating income, beat sales expectations in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nGucci-owner Kering has temporarily shut half of its stores in China, and shelved new openings and advertising campaigns there, as the coronavirus outbreak throws luxury brands into turmoil.\n\nThe French group, which also owns Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, remained upbeat about its longer-term prospects as it beat fourth-quarter sales forecasts on Wednesday.\n\nBut like rivals, it said disruptions were inevitable from an epidemic that has emptied malls and shopping streets in China, which accounts for more than a third of luxury goods sales.\n\n\"We are seeing a sharp drop in traffic and sales in mainland China,\" Chairman Francois-Henri Pinault said, adding shops that remained open, including in Hong Kong, were on reduced hours.\n\nKering is postponing store renovations and new openings as well as spending on social media and product launches in China, Pinault added.\n\nIt is also shifting inventory to other regions to make sure stocks don't pile up in China, he said, without giving an estimate for any impact from the virus on earnings.\n\nPinault expects the Chinese market to rebound strongly once the health emergency is over, and said Kering was ready to increase marketing spending in the second half of the year to make sure it doesn't miss out when sales start picking up again.\n\nBut for now he said online shopping was not really making up for the decline in store footfall. \"The warehouses are shut. People can place orders but there are no deliveries,\" he said.\n\nItalian puffer jacket maker Moncler said this week shopper numbers at its Chinese stores had plunged 80% since the virus outbreak, while jeweler Pandora has said business in the country had ground to a halt.\n\nKering makes 34% of its sales in Asia Pacific, excluding Japan. Spending on its brands by Chinese customers, who have traditionally shopped with it overseas, has shifted overwhelmingly to mainland China, where the virus originated.\n\nEntire cities in the world's second biggest economy are now shut off, flights have been cancelled and many countries are banning entry to visitors coming from China, exposing Kering and other high-end houses to a major sales hit.\n\nPinault said that since last week Kering had begun to see the impact of fewer Chinese tourists in Europe and the United States. In China, Kering is taking steps to protect its staff, such as paying for taxis so they can avoid public transport.\n\nThe crisis has compounded a plunge in sales in Hong Kong due to months of anti-government protests. Kering's fourth-quarter sales in the Chinese territory halved.\n\nNonetheless, group revenue rose 13.8% to 4.36 billion euros ($4.76 billion) in October-December, helped by demand in China prior to the virus outbreak. That equated to an 11.4% increase on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency moves and acquisitions, beating analyst forecasts for around 10% growth.\n\nKering shares were up 3.5% at 14:16 GMT.\n\nKering now relies on Gucci for 83% of its recurring operating income.\n\nThe brand's flamboyant style, an e-commerce push and an expansion of its products in homewares and perfumes have made it one of the fastest-growing luxury labels in recent years. But analysts have questioned whether it can keep up the momentum, and whether Kering is overly-reliant on one brand.\n\n\"Whether Gucci can enter in a more steady phase of growth and turn into an attractive 'cash cow' will be key to the Kering investment case ... especially in the absence of large-scale, transformational mergers and acquisitions,\" Citi analysts said.\n\nPinault said Kering was looking at potential opportunities but was selective and did not want to buy brands that could directly rival those it already owns. Commenting on recent reports that Kering was interested in Moncler, he said there were \"no active talks\" with the Italian group.\n\nGucci beat sales expectations in the fourth quarter, with revenue up 10.5% versus a consensus forecast of around 9.5%, and it returned to growth in the United States after an advertising and diversity campaign helped reverse a blip there.\n\nAs a whole, Kering posted a 37.4% drop in net income for 2019, hit in part by a record Italian tax settlement of 1.25 billion euros linked to Gucci.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news",

rejected entry from five different ports over two weeks over fears that its passengers may be infected with the Wuhan coronavirus -- has finally docked.\n\nThe ship was received by a port in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, and its more than 2,250 passengers were quarantined while 20 were tested for coronavirus.\n\nNone of them have been infected, the country's ministry of health said.\n\nSome people who complained of mild respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were being treated by the Westerdam's own doctors, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said on Twitter.\n\nThe luxury liner, operated by Holland America Line, set sail from Hong Kong on February 1 only to spend 13 days stranded at sea as port after port turned it away.\n\nThailand, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and the US territory of Guam refused to permit the Westerdam to dock due to coronavirus fears.\n\nCoronavirus cases are nearing 60,000 and almost 1,400 people have died of the illness, according to Beijing's National Health Commission.\n\nUnlike the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been quarantined off the coast of Yokohama and is plagued by a seemingly ever-rising number of coronavirus patients -- 218 at last count, Holland America Line insisted that its guests and crew have not tested positive for coronavirus.\n\n\"All guests onboard are healthy and despite erroneous reports, there are no known or suspected cases of coronavirus on board, nor have there ever been,\" Holland America Line wrote in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nOnce permitted ashore on Friday morning, passengers will able to take charter flights to the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, from where they can fly home. Holland America Line, which is owned by Carnival Corp., will arrange and pay for the travel of the 2,257 people on board. Guests have been refunded the cruise's costs and offered credit toward a future cruise as well, the statement said.\n\nTweets with footage from bystanders and local media showed passengers making heart shapes with their hands, and cheering and applauding when they finally reached Cambodia.\n\nChristina Kerby, who has been live-tweeting from the Westerdam and regaling people with stories of bath towel animals and dessert samplings, shared her excitement upon spotting land for the first time.\n\nShe quipped also that after nearly two weeks at sea, she may need a water bed at home to fall asleep.\n\nAn apparent fan of Westerdam's muesli, Kerby said that people are \"upbeat\" even after the cereal ran out, noting that officials have boarded the ship to collect passports so passengers can be issued visas to enter Cambodia.\n\nKerby told Insider that passengers were asked to fill out a standard health screening questionnaire and disclose cough, fever, and diarrhea -- all stomps of coronavirus.\n\n\"I imagine those who reported symptoms may receive additional screening,\" she said. \"The captain tells us he's hopeful we'll be able to disembark tomorrow and it could take [two to three] days to get all passengers' travel arrangements.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people are spending their time swimming, eating ice cream, and generally enjoying the weather in Cambodia, she said. Deciding to live on the edge a little, Kerby donned sneakers to dinner.\n\nKerby said she was started awake when the captain of the ship announced that all 20 passengers tested negative for coronavirus -- but said the news was worth it.\n\nThe Westerdam's February 15 cruise has been canceled, Holland America Line said. Additional precautionary measures, including preboarding medical screenings and delaying crew members from China from coming to work on any ships, are being enforced.\n\nPeople who have traveled from or through mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau in the 14 days prior to their cruise start date will be denied entry, as will anyone who has come in contact with a person who has contracted coronavirus or been quarantined for it.\n\nAfter the ship docked, Ghebreyesus thanked Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen for embodying the \"international solidarity\" that the WHO has been calling for.", "source":
