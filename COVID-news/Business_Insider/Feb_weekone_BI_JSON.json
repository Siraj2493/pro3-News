There are only 3 possible endings to this story.", "body": "Here are three ways that experts think the coronavirus pandemic could play out. Most likely, the outbreak will never truly end.\n\nA coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, in December has killed at least 630 people and infected more than 31,500 across 26 countries.\n\nAccording to public-health experts, there are only three possible endings to this coronavirus story: The outbreak could be controlled via public-health interventions and disappear (as SARS did), a vaccine could be developed, or the coronavirus will become a permanent part of the repertoire of human viruses, perhaps like seasonal flu.\n\nThat third option is the most likely, two experts told Business Insider - the new virus may never truly disappear.\n\n\"Right now, the actions being taken in China - the Draconian efforts - are what happens when you're trying to catch a galloping horse that's already left the barn,\" Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, said.\n\nHere are the three ways the coronavirus outbreak could play out.\n\nAccording to researchers at World Health Organization (WHO), an average person with the new coronavirus passes it to between 1.4 and 2.5 other people. The group declared the coronavirus an international public-health emergency on January 30.\n\n\"There is sustained human-to-human spread now, mostly in China,\" Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at John Hopkins' Center for Health Security, told Business Insider. \"For all intents and purposes, we're in the beginnings of a mild pandemic right now.\"\n\nOne disease-transmission model from the journal Annals of Internal Medicine suggests that more than 300,000 people could get the coronavirus by February 24.\n\nCurrently, four other coronaviruses are endemic - meaning permanently present - in the global population. They all cause common colds (though each can cause pneumonia and death in rare instances). Because these human coronaviruses are so mild, they don't have names beyond their four-character designations: OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63.\n\nAccording to Adalja, the new coronavirus - whose scientific name is 2019-nCoV - could become a member of the club of constantly circulating, endemic coronaviruses.\n\n\"We have to be prepared for this to become the fifth community-acquired coronavirus,\" he said.\n\nIf the coronavirus does become a permanent fixture among humans, one possibility - let's call it outcome 1a - is that it winds up fluctuating with the seasons the way the flu does. If that proves to be the case, 2019-nCoV could retreat in the summer then return en force in the fall and winter each year.\n\n\"If you look at the trajectory of the virus and how it's spreading in communities, coupled with the fact that we deal with coronaviruses every year during flu and cold season, those factors point to this coronavirus becoming a seasonal virus,\" Adalja said.\n\nThe other four coronaviruses have seasonality too, Adalja added, so cases of the new one \"may temper off as we leave spring and enter summer.\"\n\nThe flu is seasonal because cooler temperatures help harden a protective gel-like coating that surrounds the virus while it's in the air. A stronger shell ensures it can survive long enough in the air to travel from one person to the next.\n\n\"The [flu] virus survives better in cool, dry temperatures,\" Amanda Simanek, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, told Insider.\n\nUnlike the flu, however, Morse said the coronavirus is unlikely to mutate every season. The flu virus' genes change via a process called antigenic drift, and each small mutation gives rise to a new, closely related flu virus that our immune systems have to start fighting from scratch. (That's why flu vaccines aren't always 100% effective.)\n\n\"Coronaviruses, on the whole, somewhat less prone to mutation than flu,\" Morse said.\n\nThere is also a chance - let's call it outcome 1b - that the new coronavirus becomes milder and more similar to the other four endemic coronaviruses. But Morse said he'd be surprised if that happens, though.\n\n\"I'm not optimistic enough to think this one is going to do that initially,\" he said. \"It may eventually evolve into that, a circulating illness that resembles the other four, but it will take time.\"\n\nThe 2019-nCoV outbreak is similar to the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in many ways: Both are coronaviruses that originated in bats, and both likely jumped from animals to people in Chinese wet markets. The two viruses share about 80% of their DNA. So the outcome of the new outbreak could be similar to that of SARS, too.\n\nSARS killed 774 people and infected more than 8,000 between November 2002 and July 2003 but disappeared by 2004. Public-health experts and authorities worked hard to track down, diagnose, and isolate infected people to force the virus to \"play itself out,\" Morse said.\n\nThe spread of SARS was eventually limited via quarantines, travel restrictions, public-information campaigns, and airport screenings - the same types of interventions China and other countries are instituting now.\n\nIf those efforts lead the the number of people susceptible to the new coronavirus to drop below a certain threshold, Morse said, the outbreak will be contained. In that scenario, it would either disappear eventually or become like Zika or H1N1 - diseases that continue to circulate, but among far fewer people than they did after first appearing.\n\nHowever, SARS was far less contagious than 2019-nCoV. SARS spread primarily in healthcare and hospital settings, and people weren't infectious until they started showing symptoms. By contrast, researchers think people can likely transmit the new coronavirus even when they don't show symptoms. That makes it far more challenging to halt its spread.\n\nMorse and Adalja both said a vaccine is essential if the world is to definitively control 2019-nCoV.\n\nA lot of the current public-health interventions are a \"holding action to keep the virus from spreading in the short term until we get vaccine,\" Morse said.\n\nFive leading drug companies - Johnson & Johnson, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline, Moderna, and Gilead Sciences - have announced plans to research and develop treatments for the new virus.\n\nSome are developing vaccines from scratch based on the coronavirus' genetic code. Others are testing existing drugs to determine whether they're effective at treating the new virus.\n\nGetting a vaccine to market has historically been an arduous, multi-year process (the Ebola vaccine took 20 years to make). But Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) infectious disease center, said on Friday that the agency is collaborating with Moderna to develop a coronavirus vaccine quickly.\n\nBarring any \"glitches,\" Fauci said, \"we will be in people, with a phase-one trial in the next 2.5 months.\"\n\nThe introduction of a vaccine would decrease the number of people susceptible to the coronavirus and create a \"sustained firewall\" against its further spread, Morse said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"},

As of the end of the day Friday, the death toll for the new Wuhan coronavirus was 724. The Hubei Health Commission announced Sunday another 81 people died Saturday in the province, bringing the provincial death toll to 780 and the global death toll to at least 805.\n\nThe Chinese National Health Commission announced later in the day that the death toll in mainland China is now 811 with global losses at 813.\n\nThe number of cases of the Wuhan coronavirus globally is more than three times that of SARS, which infected only 8,098 people between November 2002 and July 2003.\n\nAlthough the Wuhan coronavirus has resulted in the deaths of more people than SARS, it appears to be significantly less deadly. The mortality rate for SARS was roughly 9% while the Wuhan coronavirus kills only around 2% of those infected.\n\nIn Wuhan, the mortality rate is over 4%.\n\nMost of those who die from the Wuhan coronavirus tend to be individuals who are older or who have other illnesses, but that is not always the case. Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor in Wuhan who tried to warn others about the virus early on but was reprimanded by local authorities for \"spreading rumors,\" died Thursday after fighting on the frontlines of the outbreak.\n\nWhile the virus has spread across China and to more than two dozen countries, as well as a few cruise ships, Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan, have been hit hardest by the coronavirus.\n\nWuhan, a metropolis home to around 11 million people, has been locked down for weeks, the streets of a once vibrant city eerily empty, drone footage shows.\n\nThe city, a major transportation hub and port town, has rushed to build two new hospitals and transformed schools, sports centers, and other existing venues into makeshift medical facilities with thousands of beds, still not enough as the number of infected continues to climb.\n\nA number of drastic steps have been taken to curb the spread. For example, deceased victims of the coronavirus are cremated immediately without funerals. Wuhan authorities have ordered every resident to report their body temperature to health officials daily, and a citywide sterilization campaign aimed at disinfecting the entire city is underway.\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus, like SARS, is a type of serious respiratory illness. Early symptoms include fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, but given the long incubation period, up to 14 days, it is possible for someone to be both asymptomatic and infectious, which has made controlling the spread a challenge.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has called the spread of the coronavirus a \"grave situation.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news",

all but confirmed that the new coronavirus spreading in China -- called nCoV-2019 -- originally came from bats.\n\nBut experts are still racing to pin down another key piece of the zoonotic puzzle: which animal species served as the virus' intermediary between bats and people.\n\nMany possibilities have been floated, including snakes (which is unlikely), pigs, and a weasel-like animal called a civet that passed SARS from bats to people in 2002. Now, a group of researchers from South China Agricultural University in Guangdong suggest the coronavirus' intermediate host might have been the pangolin, an endangered mammal.\n\nAccording to China's Xinhua news agency, the researchers found that samples of coronaviruses taken from wild pangolins and from infected patients are 99% identical.\n\nBut this research has yet to be published or confirmed by other experts.\n\nThe novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan has so far killed more than 630 people and infected more than 31,500.\n\nMany coronaviruses are zoonotic diseases, meaning they spread to humans from animals. In the case of this one, experts think the virus first infected people at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where live animals were sold. SARS, which is also a coronavirus, jumped to people at a wet market. too. It originated in bats as well.\n\nAt least one species of pangolin can die from coronaviruses, according to a study published last year. That strengthens the theory that the new coronavirus could have jumped from bats to these creatures before making its way into humans.\n\n\"I can definitely believe it could be true,\" Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at Scripps Research, told Nature. \"I look forward to the published report and data.\"\n\nA pangolin resembles a scaly anteater. Its keratin scales are used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicinal remedies, and its meat is a delicacy in China and Vietnam.\n\nAll eight pangolin species are threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Pangolins were the most trafficked non-human species in the world in 2013, according to National Geographic; the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species declared pangolin trade illegal in 2016.\n\nIn China, illegal animal trading is punishable by steep fines and jail time. It's not yet clear whether any pangolins (or bats, for that matter) were sold at the Huanan market.\n\nA study published Monday in the journal Nature found that the new coronavirus shares 96% of its genetic code with coronaviruses circulating in Chinese bat populations. The research also showed that the virus can dock to a receptor in human cells called ACE2, deep in people's lungs.\n\nThat same receptor exists in bats, pigs, and civets, which is why they're the most likely intermediary-species candidates.\n\nA less likely candidate is snakes, despite a January 22 report from scientists who edit the Journal of Medical Virology; they suggested the Chinese cobra could have served as the link. But Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, said newer information about the coronavirus genome indicates it's \"not really compatible with some of the more exotic hosts that were considered earlier in the epidemic.\"\n\nThe only way to be sure about where the virus came from, however, is to take DNA samples from animals sold at the Huanan market and from bats in the area.\n\nIn the past 45 years, at least four pandemics have been traced back to bats. They were the original source of Ebola, which has killed 13,500 people in multiple outbreaks since 1976; Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, better known as MERS, which can be found in 28 countries; and the Nipah virus, which has a 78% fatality rate.\n\nResearchers traced SARS to a population of horseshoe bats in China's Yunnan province. The virus killed 774 people and infected more than 8,000 in eight months.\n\n\"We know a fair amount of viruses on the World Health Organization's Blueprint list of priority diseases have either a direct or indirect link with bats,\" Vincent Munster, a virologist at Rocky Mountain Kaboratories, previously told Business Insider.\n\nBats pass along viruses in their poop: If they drop feces onto a piece of fruit that another animal then eats, the creature can become a carrier.\n\nHere's how some of the viruses that have passed from bats to people in the last 50 years compare.\n\n\"It is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThat's because the majority of coronaviruses can be found in China. Plus, the study authors said, most of the bats that host coronaviruses \"live near humans in China, potentially transmitting viruses to humans and livestock.\"", "source": {"uri":

hours later", "body": "While it's possible that the coronavirus jumped from the mother to the child in the womb, one expert said it was more likely the infant caught the illness after birth.\n\nA 30-hour-old infant born in a children's hospital in Wuhan, China, has become the youngest person to catch the new coronavirus.\n\nThe newborn's mother has the coronavirus, the South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday, citing the state broadcaster CCTV. The baby's case raises the possibility that the new virus could jump from person to person via vertical transmission, or when a person passes a virus to their child in the womb, during childbirth, or via breast milk.\n\n\"We should be concerned about the possible new transmission route of the coronavirus,\" Zeng Lingkong, a senior physician at the Wuhan children's hospital's neonatal department, told the Post, adding that pregnant people should stay away from people with the coronavirus.\n\nCCTV said the infected infant's vital signs were stable, according to the Post. An Instagram post from China's People's Daily newspaper showed the infant in an incubator.\n\nHowever, Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, told Business Insider than an in-utero transmission was improbable.\n\n\"It's more likely that the baby contracted the virus from the hospital environment, the same way healthcare workers get infected by the patients they treat,\" Morse said. \"It's quite possible that the baby picked it up very conventionally - by inhaling virus droplets that came from the mother coughing.\"\n\nThere is no evidence that the two other coronaviruses that have caused major outbreaks - severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS - are capable of vertical transmission.\n\nOther viruses, like HIV and Zika, can pass through the placenta and infect an unborn fetus. During labor and delivery, a newborn can also contract HIV through exposure to infected blood and bodily fluids.\n\n\"A lot of the transmission that we saw in HIV was actually not in utero but exposure of the baby while being born,\" Morse said.\n\nThe infant that got the new coronavirus could have been infected during birth in a similar way, he added. But unlike HIV, this coronavirus is a respiratory infection and doesn't jump from person to person via blood, but via phlegm and saliva droplets.\n\n\"For a respiratory virus, it would be pretty unusual,\" Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on Wednesday of the possibility of in-utero transmission. \"This is really the first such report that we've seen.\"\n\nXinhua, China's state-run press agency, said a woman with the coronavirus gave birth to a healthy child in Heilongjiang province on Monday, Newsweek reported.\n\nFrom December 31, when the outbreak was first reported, and January 22, no cases were recorded in children under 15.\n\nIn total, the coronavirus has killed at least 494 people and infected more than 24,000 other people.\n\nA recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested that \"children might be less likely to become infected or, if infected, may show milder symptoms\" than adults.\n\nA few cases of the virus among children have been reported in the past two weeks, however. On January 26, a 9-month-old girl was diagnosed in Beijing, then a child in Germany whose father was diagnosed with the coronavirus tested positive on January 31.\n\nOn Tuesday, health officials in China's Guizhou province reported that a 1-month-old infant had been diagnosed with the virus there.\n\nStill, the coronavirus seems to primarily affect an older population. In a recent study of 99 people with the coronavirus, their average age was 55.5. Another study of 41 coronavirus cases reported that the median age of those who had died was about 75. Many of those people had other health issues like high blood pressure, diabetes, or Parkinson's disease.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"},

Wisconsin.\n\nA patient in Wisconsin has been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, the state's health department told Business Insider on Wednesday. It's the 12th case in the US; the first was confirmed on January 24.\n\nThe Wisconsin patient had \"a history of travel to Beijing, China, prior to becoming ill,\" according to the state's health department. The patient was tested at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison, Ryan Westergaard, the department's chief medical officer, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe person is isolated at home and doing well, officials added, but they declined to provide further details. Before the announcement, Wisconsin had been investigating 10 cases of the virus, and seven had come back negative.\n\n\"The risk of getting sick from 2019 novel coronavirus in Wisconsin is very low,\" State Health Officer Jeanne Ayers said in a statement. \"We are responding aggressively to the situation and monitoring all developments. We are committed to keeping the public fully informed and will continue to provide updates as this situation unfolds.\"\n\nThe coronavirus has killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000 people globally since December, with the majority of cases occurring in China. The virus likely originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, China.\n\nFor the latest case total, death toll, and travel information, see Business Insider's live updates here.\n\nThe outbreak has spread to 25 other countries: Australia, Belgium, Cambodia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, the US, and Vietnam.\n\nIn addition to the Wisconsin patient, the US has 11 other confirmed cases: six people in California, a husband and wife in Chicago, a man in his 30s in Washington state, one patient in Arizona, and one in Massachusetts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of those patients were \"doing well\" on Wednesday.\n\nIn two of the cases, the virus was transmitted human to human among family members.\n\nThe coronavirus family is a large group of viruses that typically affect the respiratory tract. Coronaviruses can lead to illnesses such as the common cold, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which sickened 8,000 people and killed 774 from November 2002 to July 2003.\n\nPeople with the new coronavirus - known as 2019-nCoV - have reported symptoms such as fevers, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Most of the people who have died were elderly or otherwise unwell, Chinese officials have said.\n\nThe risk in the US is still low, according to the CDC. Officials at the agency recommend that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water and refrain from touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands to avoid spreading of the virus.\n\nWe're in an 'age of epidemics,' a scientist says. More diseases like the coronavirus will jump from animals to people.\n\nChinese doctors released chest scans of a 33-year-old coronavirus patient that show what the illness looks like in her lungs\n\nScientists have published over 50 studies on Wuhan coronavirus in the last 3 weeks. They learned that 75,800 people in Wuhan could be infected.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

is nasty over here': Expats in China struggle with lost wages, abandoned and hungry pets, and the looming threat of quarantines amid coronavirus outbreak", "body": "Jym Cotton, who lives in the currently deserted tourist destination of Sanya, can still leave his house freely but is certain that the virus \"has affected everyone in some way.\"\n\nJovan Vazquez has taken to carrying a thermometer with him every time he leaves his house. That's his attempt at avoiding being hauled off to a hospital or being quarantined every time his temperature fluctuates.\n\nOriginally from South Carolina, he is now living as an expat in China, which is in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nVazquez told Business Insider that officials in his residential community and others are checking if people have a fever every time they try to go home.\n\n\"The equipment [is] not really accurate as I have been read as having too high of a temperature at [times], then too low of a temperature,\" he said. \"I have a thermometer that takes the reading from the ear, which I have used multiple times to prove I am not ill. It's pretty scary that if you have a slight fever, say from the common cold, you will not be able to enter your own home.\"\n\nVazquez lives with his wife and 17-month-old son in Haining, in Zhejiang province, which has recently made headlines for adopting severe measures, including banning weddings and funerals and locking people into their homes, to halt the spread of the virus.\n\nOn Friday, the National Health Commission in Beijing reported more than 31,000 cases of coronavirus and more than 630 deaths.\n\nLess than one million people call Haining home, and the city was coronavirus-free until earlier this week, Vazquez said. One case was reported in a sub-city called Chang'an, and, by Friday, that number had climbed to four.\n\nLocal officials responded by closing down Haining.\n\n\"Nobody enters and nobody leaves unless you have a special permit from the government to leave the city,\" Vazquez said, adding that grocery stores are open for a few hours a day along with some restaurants and pharmacies \"but nothing else.\"\n\nVazquez uses WeChat to connect with other expats in the area and said the collective belief is that \"it doesn't take a medical doctor to know that this virus is a big deal. And due to the population density, it's going to continue to infect people.\"\n\nReports emerged on Thursday of officials in four cities in Zhejiang - an area of more than 30 million residents - giving households one so-called passport each.\n\nAnother expat, Jeff Sinner, said the restrictions are mirrored in Xi'an, in Shaanxi province, where he lives.\n\n\"I was given a ticket with the date on it that I need to give my security guards before I go out to buy vegetables,\" he said. \"Also, only one person from each residence is able to leave the community.\n\n\"Two days ago, I was able to leave my community easily but when I wanted to [return], I had to show my passport and get my temperature taken before I would be allowed in.\"\n\nSinner, who is waiting to hear when the middle school where he teaches will reopen and he will be allowed to return to work, said he has also seen trucks driving through the city, \"spraying a disinfectant all over the place.\" People are confined to their homes from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. while they do that, he said.\n\n\"It is nasty over here right now,\" he mused.\n\nJenny Coulson, of Australia, is having an equally tough time in Shenzhen, China but for slightly different reasons.\n\nShe and her partner, Sachin Patel, from India, run Karuna Rescue, an organization that rescues and rehabilitates dogs and cats. The pair are currently taking care of 120 animals and that number is ballooning every day, which poses serious challenges when it comes to finding enough pet food.\n\nInitial reports blamed wet markets for the coronavirus and said that the illness likely jumped from a snake to a human, although cases of human-to-human infection are now being reported.\n\nAs a result, Coulson said, \"many households are abandoning their pets, due to fear of cross-contamination.\"\n\nPeople who have contracted coronavirus are also reaching out to Karuna Rescue since \"they desperately need someone to take in their pets as they are taken off to hospital. And migrant workers have been locked down in other cities, unable to return to their pets in their homes in Shenzhen.\"\n\nAn Instagram video shows a masked Patel searching for a cat named CanCan, whose owner \"is in lockdown in a village in the middle of China somewhere. He's alone, and no one will come out to feed him.\" The good news is CanCan was found safely and Coulson and Patel are now caring for him.\n\nInstagram Embed: //instagram.com/p/B8Rd8AbpzKI/embed Width: 540px\n\nBy contrast, the coronavirus hasn't overwhelmed Jym Cotton with work. It's emptied all the classrooms in which he works as a private teacher.\n\nThe crisis has hurt his ability to make money, he said. \"I'm surviving on a few online classes that allow me to make a little income.\n\nCotton, a former landscaper from Florida, lives in Sanya, a popular tourist destination in the Hainan province. He said it now resembles a ghost town. Everything from theaters to parks and bus depots to public restrooms has been shut down.\n\nThe main drag into Cotton's housing complex is normally plagued with gridlock traffic all day. But now the streets lie \"barren,\" he observed.\n\n\"I'm not sure the threat to human life is as bad as the pandemonium surrounding these events suggest, but, in reality, to those who live here, this outbreak has affected everyone in some way,\" he said.\n\nCotton home-schools his four daughters, who keep him busy with badminton and family time. They are still allowed to venture outside freely and Cotton, although worried about the economic impact of the coronavirus not only on his family but all of China, remains hopeful.\n\n\"I've lived through, and seen a lot here, in my 20 years,\" he said. \"I'm sure we will be getting through this current crisis as well.\"\n\nHave you been personally impacted by the coronavirus epidemic?

Tom Cotton suggested that Chinese officials misled the public on the origins of the novel coronavirus that has killed at least 362 people and infected more than 17,400 others, saying it may have originated in a \"superlaboratory.\"\n\nAt a Senate Armed Service Committee hearing with US military leaders on Thursday, Cotton described the coronavirus as the \"biggest and most important story in the world\" and \"worse than Chernobyl.\"\n\nCotton, a longtime China hawk, suggested Beijing had not been as forthcoming about the number of infections and was \"lying about it from the very beginning\" to downplay the seriousness of the epidemic. Chinese officials have been accused of lowering the number of cases and tamping down on reports weeks before it was formally acknowledged by the government.\n\n\"They also claimed, for almost two months until earlier this week, that it originated in a seafood market in Wuhan,\" Cotton said, referring to a study published by The Lancet. \"That is not the case.\"\n\nInitial studies linked the virus to various sources, including a seafood market in Wuhan, China, and bats. In one of the studies from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, six of the seven virus samples were from patients who worked at the Huanan wholesale seafood market.\n\n\"Of the original 40 cases, 14 of them had no contact with the seafood market, including patient zero,\" Cotton said. \"I would note that Wuhan also has China's only bio-safety level four 'superlaboratory' that works with the world's most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.\"\n\nCotton was referring to China's first Biosafety Level 4 lab, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which investigates \"the most dangerous pathogens,\" according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhile Cotton qualified his remarks by saying \"we still don't know where\" the virus originated, his comments come amid numerous conspiracy theories about the virus's origins -- including one that says the virus \"originated in lab linked to China's biowarfare program.\"\n\nThe amount of false information spreading across social-media platforms has prompted several companies, including Facebook, to limit the reach of such posts. In a statement, Facebook said it would display \"accurate information\" and notify users if they are suspected of sharing false or misleading information.\n\nChina accused the US of \"fear and overreaction\" after President Donald Trump imposed a temporary travel ban on people who had visited China within the past 14 days.\n\n\"In the face of the public-health crisis, countries should work

China's Health Commission reported Sunday that among those infected there, 475 people have made full recoveries and 361 have died. The rest are still being treated.\n\nZhan Qingyuan, director of pneumonia prevention and treatment at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, said even people who have recovered may not be immune to the virus.\n\n\"For those patients who have been cured, there is a likelihood of a relapse,\" he said in a briefing on Friday. \"The antibody will be generated; however, in certain individuals, the antibody cannot last that long.\"\n\nThe larger coronavirus family includes the viruses that cause SARS, MERS, and the common cold. Most coronaviruses cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory infections, and many -- including the new strain -- spread to people from animals.\n\nWhen a virus enters a human body, it tries to attach to and take over host cells. In response, our immune systems produce antibodies: proteins that recognize and remove viruses.\n\nThat's how humans become immune to certain illnesses. Children that have contracted chickenpox, for example, are immune to the disease as adults. Vaccines are another way to develop immunity.\n\n\"With many infectious diseases, a person can develop immunity against a specific strain after exposure or infection,\" Amira Roess, a professor of Global Health and Epidemiology at George Mason University, told Business Insider. \"Often, that person will not get sick again upon subsequent exposure to it. Regarding this specific strain of coronavirus, scientists are working to answer this question.\"\n\nDoctors and virologists don't yet know enough about the Wuhan coronavirus to say whether humans develop full immunity after they've contracted the illness. According to Zhan, doctors aren't sure that the antibodies patients develop are strong or long-lasting enough to keep them from contracting the disease again.\n\nViruses can also mutate quickly, so immunity to one strain doesn't guarantee immunity to another.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency last week. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called it a \"grave threat.\"\n\nOfficials believe that the coronavirus might have jumped from animals to people in a seafood market in Wuhan that sold live animals; SARS also spilled over to humans at a Chinese wet market. Coronavirus cases have been reported in 24 countries beyond China.\n\nPublic-health experts are urging the public to not panic, however, and recommend instead that individuals take everyday preventative measures to reduce their risk of disease, including increased hand-washing, avoiding touching one's face, and staying away from people who are sick.", "source": {"uri":

Symptoms include fevers and coughing.\n\nOne hundred and fifty-three other people were tested because they had come into close contact with those showing symptoms.\n\nAuthorities have quarantined the ship for the next 14 days, Japan's health ministry said, according to NHK.

on the need to reduce the cross-border flow ... but at this critical juncture, I could not agree with the use of extreme means.\"\n\nThe first coronavirus death in Hong Kong prompted thousands of hospital employees to walk off the job on Tuesday, the second day of a country-wide health worker strike.\n\nThe strikers are lobbying for the full closure of the semi-autonomous territory's border with mainland China, where the National Health Commission has reported 24,300-plus cases of coronavirus and nearly 500 deaths.\n\nSo far, Hong Kong has seen 17 cases - seven of them among mainland China residents - and the death of one man.\n\nThe 39-year-old visited Wuhan the day before it was put on lockdown and effectively cut off from the rest of China, Al Jazeera reported. The man then boarded a high-speed train from Changsha to Hong Kong.\n\nLocal officials told Al Jazeera that the man, who was diabetic, declined rapidly overnight on Monday. An autopsy has been ordered so they can pinpoint what caused his death.\n\nThe man's mother, 72, contracted the coronavirus from him and is hospitalized in stable condition. This case also marks Hong Kong's first human-to-human transmission of the deadly virus, the Post reported. Other family members have been quarantined.\n\nNews of the man's death has shaken the close-knit community where he lived. Several relatives lived only three floors below his apartment, Al Jazeera found.\n\nOn Monday night, authorities in Hong Kong blocked all but three border crossing points with mainland China and restricted ferry services from Macau. Hong Kong International Airport, the Shenzhen Bay joint checkpoint, and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge are currently the only ways in and out of Hong Kong, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nBut the public is keen on a total closure.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of 20,000 people surveyed by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute support a full border closure, while 75% said they were unhappy with how the government had handled the coronavirus outbreak and 61% offered their support to the striking public health workers, viewing it a way to put pressure on the government, according to poll results.\n\nAt a media conference on Tuesday, Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the suspension of high-speed rail and ferry services between Hong Kong and China, the Atlantic reported. The number of flights to mainland China has also been slashed in half and the government is no longer issuing personal travel permits to mainland residents who want to enter Hong Kong.\n\nLam told reporters, however, that she \"certainly would not agree with the allegation that we are not addressing this public health concern adequately. Certainly, I do not agree with the allegation that we are putting politics above public health,\" Al Jazeera said.\n\nThe Post reported that Lam has also doubled down on the claim that many people from Hong Kong need to cross the border and that it would be unfair to entirely block access from the mainland.\n\n\"When it comes to infection control, when it comes to a virus, there is no boundary, so you cannot differentiate that people of a certain race, of a certain nationality ... are more prone to infection than other people, we have to treat them equally,\" she said.\n\nSixty percent of the 11,\u2009715 visitors who came to Hong Kong from mainland China on Sunday entered through the three border points that are currently open, according to RTHK, a local media group that cited data from Hong Kong's Immigration Department.\n\nBut Winnie Yu, chairperson of the Hospital Authority Employees' Alliance, a newly-minted labor union that represents an estimated 9,000 employees out of Hong Kong's Hospital Authority's 67,000 staff members, disagrees with Lam.\n\n\"There is still a chance to save Hong Kong from the destiny of turning into another Wuhan, being cut off from the world, patients turned away from fully occupied hospitals, and healthcare staff crumbling under the severe pressure,\" she said, according to medical journal BMJ.\n\nAround 2,700 people missed work on Monday. The fact that almost 1,200 doctors and nurses were on strike forced cancer treatments and angioplasty surgeries to be postponed, the Post said. That number ballooned to over 7,000 on Tuesday, Al Jazeera reported.\n\n\"The measure provided by the Hong Kong government won't work because it is not a complete shutdown of the border,\" Yu said at a media conference, RTHK reported. \"The Wuhan pneumonia carrier may still be able to come into Hong Kong with these measures.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Hospital Authority said that the strike had made a severe dent in the available emergency services, and asked people with mild illnesses to use private hospitals or clinics rather than public hospitals, according to the BMJ. Despite the knowledge that Hong Kong's medical care will be affected by the healthcare workers' strike and some hospitals might need to shut down entire wards, Yu said the group is receiving \"tremendous\" support from patients.\n\n\"A semi-blockage is just as good as none,\" Yu said, per the BMJ, adding: \"[Carrie Lam's] measures are not going to stop the disease from being introduced to Hong Kong.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lam made an attempt to assuage strikers' concerns, the Post reported.\n\n\"I completely understand that medical professionals have been on the forefront, I respect them, and we will do our utmost to supply them with protective gear,\" she said. \"We agree with them on the need to reduce the cross-border flow ... but at this critical juncture, I could not agree with the use of extreme means.\"\n\nA Hong Komg woman, who identified herself only as Karen, told Business Insider that Lam's plan to quarantine everyone who enters the territory from mainland China - even local residents - from Saturday \"would have been much more helpful\" if put in place during the surge in travel for Lunar New Year.\n\nIvan Law, the Alliance's vice chairman, is equally worried about the upcoming change, but for slightly different reasons. He is afraid that an influx of people ahead of the deadline could overwhelm medical staff and further spread the virus, RTHK said.\n\nKaren echoed the sentiment, saying: not closing the border will only put higher level of stress on the inadequate resources and manpower to treat local patients + patients from mainland China.\n\n\"I think Carrie Lam understood what the people are asking for yet she's reacting much slower than the infection rate of the virus ... Not closing the border will only put higher [levels] of stress on the inadequate resources and manpower to treat local patients [and] patients from mainland China.\"\n\nMany feel Hong Kong hasn't fully been able to put its experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) behind it, which may be lending itself to the territory's reaction to the coronavirus.\n\nThe SARS outbreak originated in China in November 2002, and by August 2003, had affected 8,422 people and killed 916, across 29 countries and three regions, according to a study by the Earth Institute at Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\"Because the world was kept in the dark about the seriousness of the outbreak in Guangdong, Hong Kong was caught unprepared when SARS first appeared in the territory via an elderly medical doctor from Guangzhou who had been treating 'atypical pneumonia' patients,\" the study said. All told, the disease killed 299 people in Hong Kong and triggered an economic slowdown.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus has killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000.

in China, are facing potential delays or constrained shipments due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThis holiday season, the next PlayStation and Xbox consoles are scheduled to arrive.\n\nBut the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X, just like much of the world's consumer electronics, are being manufactured in China. And China is currently the focal point of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.\n\nOf the more than 560 people who have died from the virus, all but two fatalities have been in mainland China. Over 28,000 people were reported as infected as of Wednesday.\n\nChina's manufacturing sector, which is responsible for producing the vast majority of the world's consumer electronics, has been hit particularly hard. Foxconn, the manufacturing giant that produces the iPhone, is quarantining workers. At least one supply chain executive told Nikkei Asian Review that, \"The [coronavirus] situation in China could affect the planned production schedule\" of the next iPhone.\n\nSimilarly, as Microsoft and Sony ramp up production of their next-gen consoles, those launches could see delays or, at least, constrained launch supply due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"The video game sector is currently manufacturing, or beginning to, a once-in-several-years' product generation change for the 2020 holiday season,\" a note from Jefferies Group published this week says. \"If [company] shutdowns exceed a month or so, game schedules will be delayed. New consoles may likewise suffer supply issues from a prolonged disruption, ahead of their Fall 2020 planned launches.\"\n\nPut more simply: Next-gen consoles, and the games being produced for those consoles, may get hit with delays due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThough most major video games are made in North America, Europe, and Japan, large components of those games are outsourced to China. As much as \"30-50% of art creation in western games is done in China,\" according to the note. In terms of the hardware itself, nearly 100% of the manufacturing takes place in China.\n\nNotably, Nintendo has outright announced production delays due to the coronavirus outbreak -- shipments of the Nintendo Switch console are delayed to Japan, the company announced this week. Both Sony and Microsoft didn't respond to request for comment on potential next-gen console delays due to the virus outbreak.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_gilbert@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ben Gilbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxconn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical_Intermediates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical Intermediates", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "wgt": 20}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/5df3a1aafd9db259783fbd2a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-5492635", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 79}, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 79, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1433400198", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-03", "time": "11:34:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-03T11:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-03T11:33:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.47843137383461, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-china-us-spread-fear-2020-2", "title": "China accused the US of spreading global 'fear' over the Wuhan coronavirus, which has now killed 362 people", "body": "The World Health Organization last week encouraged countries to take \"measures to limit the risk of exportation or importation of the disease,\" but stopped short of advising entry bans.\n\nChina has accused the US of \"consistently creating and spreading fear\" about the deadly Wuhan coronavirus which has now killed more than 360 people, and infected 17,000.\n\nHua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry told reporters Monday that the US is \"consistently creating and spreading fear, which is a bad example.\"\n\nThe novel coronavirus -

CGTN news network, 17,237 of the confirmed infections are in mainland China, while 148 are abroad.\n\nThe US reaction to the spread of the coronavirus is in sharp contrast to the approach taken by many countries in Asia that are closely aligned to China in terms of foreign policy, trade, and investment.\n\nThe response to the coronavirus has been \"quieter\" in several such countries, The New York Times reported Sunday.\n\nIt noted that Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, said there was \"no reason to bar visitors from mainland China.\"\n\nDuterte has presided over a move towards China during his presidency, eschewing the country's traditionally strong relationship with the US.\n\n\"I need China more than anybody else at this time of our national life,\" Duterte said in 2018, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.\n\nThe health minister in Indonesia also said it was \"very easy\" to prevent the coronavirus, The Times reported. \"To prevent it is very easy as long as your immunity is good,\" said Terawan Agus Putranto.\n\nChina is investing heavily in many southeast Asian countries as it looks to expand its soft power in the region, a move which critics say forces those countries to avoid criticizing China.\n\nCritics have argued that China is engaging in debt-trap diplomacy - a strategy of extracting political concessions out of a country that owes it

China built an emergency hospital to treat Wuhan coronavirus patients in just 10 days", "body": "Business Insider spoke to a construction expert, who said that using prefabricated units is the key to constructing a building at such a fast speed.\n\nOn Sunday, China finished building an emergency hospital set up specifically to tackle the Wuhan coronavirus. It only took 10 days.\n\nThe 645,000-square-foot makeshift medical facility, which took in its first patients on Tuesday, is made up of two floors and is already equipped with 1,000 beds, several isolation wards, and 30 intensive care units.\n\nPictures of the construction first emerged on January 23 on social media, showing dozens of bulldozers and excavators rushing to level the ground.\n\nIn the days that followed, an online live stream was set up for people to follow the construction progress.\n\nUsing prefabricated units is the key to constructing a building at such a fast speed, according to David Hartley, managing director of engineering company NTX, which also focuses on hospital construction in the UK.\n\n\"Instead of first building the foundation and then following up with the superstructure (ie. the steel frame, the building, and the cladding), prefabricated units allow the construction of the foundation and the building envelope to take place in parallel.\n\n\"So the pre-fabricated element, which would be the Lego blocks that you would can see being craned in, are actually fabricated off-site in a factory at the same time the foundations are being prepared on-site.\"\n\nThe panic-built Huoshenshan hospital was also modeled on the blueprints of a medical facility which was set up in Beijing in 2003 to help tackle the SARS epidemic, which also helped speed up the construction process, according to Quartz.\n\nChinese state media has also given a lot of credit to the more than 7,500 laborers, who worked around the clock to construct the hospital.\n\nOnline footage by CGNT, shows workers saying: \"We have been working here for nine days. We have only slept for two hours in three days.\"\n\nBut many still appeared happy to lend their help. In the same CGNT footage, another worker said: \"When disaster strikes help comes from all sides. I am a Wuhan resident. It is my duty to protect my hometown.\"\n\nRobert Yates, an internationally-recognized expert on universal health coverage (UHC) said at a press conference on Tuesday that the rapid speed at which the hospital was built can be \"can be a lesson to many.\"\n\n\"In situations like this, you need the state to step in.

James Potok said he stood up on the WestJet plane and announced that he had been to \"the capital of the coronavirus\" and was \"not feeling too well.\" The plane turned around about two hours into the flight, and Potok was examined for symptoms before he was arrested and charged. Potok said he had hoped to get a viral video but had come to believe that \"what I did was wrong\" and that he \"ruined the flight\" for the 243 people on board.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nA YouTuber who forced a plane to make an emergency landing after joking that he could have the deadly coronavirus says he was trying to get a viral video and has apologized for interrupting passengers' journeys.\n\nWestJet Flight 2702 from Toronto to Montego Bay, Jamaica, turned around about two hours into the flight on Monday and returned to Pearson International Airport after Potok joked on board that he had traveled to the region of China where the virus originated, where hundreds of people have died and millions are quarantined.\n\nIn an interview with Canada's Global News, Potok said: \"I stood up, I said, 'Can I have everybody's attention, I just came back from Hunan province.' And that was it.\"\n\nHe told Toronto's City News that he had announced: \"I just came back from Hunan province, the capital of the coronavirus...I'm not feeling too well. Thank you.\"\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak started in the city of Wuhan, which is actually is located China's Hubei province, not Hunan. About 700 people cases of infection have been confirmed in Hunan.\n\nPotok said the airline staff then put him in a mask and gloves.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Ben je meer gaan verdienen?

He was arrested and charged by the police.\n\nPotok is scheduled to appear in court in Brampton on March 9, facing the charges of mischief and breach of recognizance.\n\n\"They've charged me criminally, and I have court to go to,\" Potok told Global News.\n\nHere's the route the plane ended up taking:\n\nFoto: The flight path of Flight WS 2702 from Toronto, which returned to Pearson International Airport after takeoff.sourceFlightRadar24\n\nSocial-media footage shared by City News showed passengers criticizing Potok as he was taken off the plane, including saying \"That was a good one\" and \"We could have been in the sun.\"\n\nPotok, who goes by the name Potok Philippe, described himself as an artist when describing his desire to go viral to Global News.\n\n\"I'm an artist,\" he said. \"Any publicity for myself is good publicity.\"\n\nPotok makes music videos and has more than 34,000 followers on his Instagram account, which has now been set to private. A YouTube channel called Potok Philippe, which shares his music videos, has 715 subscribers. He also has a Spotify channel, which has about 11,000 monthly listeners.\n\n\"I had my camera with me - I was looking to get a viral video,\" he said. \"I was looking to get it up on all the social-media platforms.\n\n\"I figured it would invoke some kind of reaction - not on the plane, more people seeing on social media going, 'Wow, this kid's got some balls,' or, 'This kid is crazy,' whatever it is.\"\n\n\"I was looking to create a video, yes, that would go viral,\" he said.\n\nBut he said he was apologetic for the effect on other passengers.\n\n\"It seems to me like this was in poor taste, in retrospect,\" he told Global News. \"What I did was wrong. I ruined the flight for 200 and somewhat people. I ruined their flight.\"\n\nYou can watch the interview here:\n\nHe described the reaction to his actions as mixed.\n\n\"There's all types of positions: people that are happy, people that are upset. But in the end I ruined people on the plane's trip, so I'm extremely apologetic.\"\n\nPotok said he had done other viral videos on planes with no issues.\n\n\"I fly to Jamaica five times a year,\" he said. \"One time, a couple of trips ago, I did a similar thing, I pulled my phone out, I made a viral vide, I got up, I said: 'Can I have your attention, can I have your attention.' Everyone stopped and looked. And I said: 'Lil Wayne's new album just dropped. Everybody go get it.'\n\n\"No problem with that. I sat back down, landed, everyone got off. No issue.\"\n\nThe virus has infected more than 20,000 people in China, and some cases have spread to at least 26 more countries.

found on doorknobs, another reason that washing your hands is better than wearing a mask", "body": "Masks are really only useful when you put them on the people who are already sick.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which originated in Wuhan, China in December had infected more than 20,000 people worldwide and killed 427, including two people outside mainland China.\n\nFace masks are flying off shelves around the globe, as people scramble to stop the spread of the virus. Some precincts in China have even started lottery systems for buying masks, as The Global Times reported.\n\nBut health experts stress that the best way you can stay healthy in this outbreak is cheaper and easier than buying masks.\n\nWash your hands.\n\nThis is by far the best way to prevent any contagious mucus, or expelled sputum from the coughing of another infected person, from entering your body and making you sick.\n\n\"If I could teach one thing to the public that would prevent most of the diseases that I have to deal with, it would be wash your hands, and teach your children how to wash hands,\" Dr. Sherlita Amler, an adjunct professor of public health at New York Medical College and Commissioner of Health in Westchester County, said on Friday.\n\n\"Believe it or not, most people do not have much of an idea how they really should wash their hands, and in fact, I think some people actually try to do it without getting their hands wet.\"\n\nRegular hand washing can cut your risk of developing a respiratory infection by 16%. Hand washing at any time of day (whether you've recently visited the restroom or not) can help stop the spread of many kinds of bacteria, yeasts, and viruses.\n\nThe healthcare world has known this since the 1800s, when doctors and nurses first started realizing that if they washed their hands more frequently, fewer of their patients died.\n\n\"I think a good general rule of thumb is you should wash your hands any time you feel that they might be dirty,\" Don Schaffner, a professor of food science at Rutgers, previously told Business Insider.\n\nThe temperature of the water you wash with doesn't matter much. It's more important that you use soap, lather up vigorously, and make sure you clean under the fingernails, too.\n\n\"It's the frictional movement of your hands that actually gets the bacteria off,\" Amler said.\n\nIn a pinch, rinsing with just water or using hand sanitizer can help, but nothing beats a vigorous 20 second hand scrub with suds.\n\nProper handwashing doesn't just help stop the spread of the coronavirus. A wide variety of other microbes and bacteria can hang out on surfaces and hands. Some strains of Staphylococcus, or staph, are \"found on almost every hand,\" as a team of hand washing researchers pointed out in a 2004 study, and seasonal flu and cold germs (which are far more common around the world than this novel coronavirus) can also be passed around on dirty surfaces and hands.\n\n\"You want to make sure when you have any kind of respiratory illness that's circulating, that you're frequently cleaning the surfaces that people touch,\" Amler said. \"Door knobs, computer keyboards, light switches.\"\n\nIn China, the Guangzhou Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently found the novel coronavirus on the door handle of an infected patient's home, according to Chinese state media, showing the virus can live on surfaces for several hours outside the body.\n\nApart from handwashing, keeping a distance of 6 feet from sick people, covering your cough, avoiding touching your face with your hands, and wearing a mask when you are sick can help stop the spread of infectious diseases of all kinds, and this novel coronavirus in particular.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":

died after his father and brother were put in quarantine in China over coronavirus suspicions. Yan Cheng's father sought help on Weibo, saying that his son had been left by himself for six days without food or water. Two local Chinese officials have lost their jobs after the teenager died. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nA 17-year-old with cerebral palsy died after being left alone and without care for six days while his father was quarantined in China over suspicions of having contracted the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe family lived in the Hubei province of China, where the deadly coronavirus broke out, and the boy, named Yan Cheng, was found dead on January 29, the South China Morning Post reported based on information from the Beijing Youth Daily. His death is under investigation, local government officials said, and no cause is known as yet.\n\nCheng, his 49-year-old father, Yan Xiaowen, and his 11-year-old brother, who has autism, left Wuhan on January 17 and headed to ancestral village in Huahe township in Hongan county to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Three days later, however, Xiaowen came down with a fever, the Post said.\n\nLocal officials on January 24 put Xiaowen and his younger son in quarantine at a medical facility, which left Cheng at home and without access to food, water or care. Worried about Cheng and afraid that local Communist Party officials entrusted with his care were not doing their job properly, Xiaowen on January 28 sought help on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, according to the Post.\n\nLeft alone for 6 days with 'nobody to bathe him or change his clothes and nothing to eat or drink'\n\nHis post, which included photographs of him and Cheng and his identity card, said: \"I have two disabled sons. My older son Yan Cheng has cerebral palsy. He cannot move his body, he cannot speak or look after himself. He has already been at home by himself for six days, with nobody to bathe him or change his clothes and nothing to eat or drink.\"\n\nStiff muscles, tremors, seizures, and difficulty walking, swallowing and eating are among a long list of symptoms those with cerebral palsy suffer, according to the Mayo Clinic. Depending on the severity of the illness, some people with cerebral palsy can walk while others need special aids, the CDC says. Still others, however, might not be able to move on their own at all and need lifelong care.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Ben je meer gaan verdienen?

I fear that my child will soon die. Please everybody, help send some protective suits to Yanjia village in Huahe township, Hongan county, Hubei province!\"\n\nAnother post on Xiaowen's Weibo account said that village party officials told him that Cheng had been fed twice between January 24 and January 28. However, his social media account has since been deleted, the Post found.\n\nOfficials had originally planned to place both Cheng and Xiaowen in quarantine in the same hotel on January 29, but the teenager died that afternoon, according to a report by Damihexiaomi, a WeChat publishing platform that campaigns on behalf of families of children with autism and other illnesses.\n\nThe boy's aunt told Damihexiaomi that she fed Cheng three times and changed his clothes twice during the six days that he was alone. Her own poor health prevented her from doing more. When she stopped by to take care of Cheng on Tuesday, his condition was already on the decline, the Post reported.\n\nShe was quoted in the report as saying, \"He was lying on a lounge chair but his head was hanging. His face and mouth were dirty, as well as his duvet. I washed his face and mouth with boiled water, changed his underclothes, and fed him some water and a small half-cup of rice, but he couldn't eat any more.\"\n\nCheng's death prompted the dismissal of 2 local officials\n\nCheng's case is trending on social media and has led to the local Communist Party secretary and mayor of the town of Huajiahe being sacked, BBC News reported.\n\nAccording to the Post, a Huahe township employee told Beijing Youth Daily that Hongan county was looking into Cheng's death.\n\n\"Now, the oversight [monitoring] of cadres is very strict, there is no way we could have left a boy with cerebral palsy at home with nobody looking after him,\" the employee said. \"We have, of course, done our work, but the fact is that he had died, higher authorities are investigating and they will naturally have a fair and just response.\"\n\nThe novel coronavirus outbreak was first reported on December 31 and has so far killed 426 people and spread to over 20,000 people in more than two dozen countries.

experts have a few guesses as to why", "body": "For the latest case total, death toll, and travel information, see Business Insider's live updates here.\n\nScientists are still learning about the coronavirus outbreak that has killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000 in China. One of the biggest mysteries is why so few children have gotten sick.\n\nThe outbreak was first reported on December 31, but no children younger than 15 years old had been diagnosed as of January 22. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine said at the time that \"children might be less likely to become infected or, if infected, may show milder symptoms\" than adults.\n\nSince then, doctors have recorded a few one-off cases among children: a 9-month-old girl in Beijing, a child in Germany whose father was diagnosed with the virus first, and a child in Shenzhen, China, who was infected but displayed no symptoms. On Wednesday, Chinese authorities confirmed that an infant in Wuhan, China, had tested positive for the virus 30 hours after being born; the baby's mother is a coronavirus patient.\n\nBut for the most part, kids do not seem very vulnerable to the virus.\n\n\"From everything that we've seen, and for reasons that are unclear to us, it does seem that this is primarily impacting adults,\" Richard Martinello, an associate professor of infectious disease at the Yale School of Medicine, told Business Insider. \"Some of the reports that have come out so far from China have been from adult hospitals and not pediatric hospitals, so it could just be that we're not seeing that data yet.\"\n\nA low case count among kids is a good thing, according to health experts, because children are less likely to wash their hands, cover their mouths, and refrain from touching others - behaviors that can spread germs.\n\n\"If we can protect kids - one, it's good for them, but two, it's good for the population,\" Aaron Milstone, an epidemiologist and professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University, told Business Insider. \"If it does penetrate the pediatric population, that might amplify the outbreak.\"\n\nSymptoms of the novel coronavirus are similar to those associated with pneumonia or the flu: fever, coughing, chills, headache, difficulty breathing, and a sore throat.\n\nThe coronavirus bears striking similarities to SARS, which killed 774 people and infected more than 8,000 between November 2002 and July 2003. There were also some cases of SARS among children: only 80 laboratory-confirmed cases and 55 probable or suspected cases.\n\nMost of those children developed a fever, and some had coughs or vomited as well.\n\nIn a 2007 report, experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that children 12 or younger displayed milder symptoms of SARS than adults did. No children or adolescents died from the virus, and there was only one instance in which a child transmitted SARS to another person.\n\nScientists still aren't sure why that was the case.\n\nIn the current coronavirus outbreak, there are two explanations for why so few children have gotten sick: They've either been less likely to be exposed in the first place, or there's something different about how their bodies respond to the virus.\n\n\"My guess is the lack of children being reported is because of the way the outbreak started,\" David Weber, a professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told Business Insider. Chinese authorities think the virus first jumped to people at a seafood market in Wuhan where live animals were sold.\n\n\"There aren't many children going to the fish market,\" Weber added.\n\nThe Wuhan market was shuttered on January 1, and local officials have since banned the sale of live animals citywide. On Monday, the Chinese Communist Party pledged to crack down on the illegal wildlife trade nationwide.\n\nIt's also possible that adults aren't spreading the virus to kids because people are being careful about washing their hands, covering their mouths, and self-isolating if they feel sick. The virus can spread between people through respiratory droplets such as saliva and mucus, so good hygiene is critical to prevent transmission.\n\n\"I'm a pediatrician - I love kids - but kids really fuel the spread of respiratory viruses,\" Milstone said. \"It's much easier to tell adults to practice common-sense good behaviors. If kids are sick, they still want to go snuggle with mommy or play with their siblings.\"\n\nAs the outbreak continues to grow, however, countries could start to report more cases among children.\n\n\"When we see any new virus, the whole population is susceptible,\" Milstone said. \"We don't know that this virus tickles the respiratory tract of adults more than it does kids.\"\n\nStill, the flu likely poses a more imminent threat to most kids worldwide than the coronavirus, Weber said.\n\n\"People should be at the moment much more concerned about influenza and other respiratory or viral diseases,\" he said. \"In many outbreaks of flu, it's the children who spread it more than the adults.\"\n\nChildren younger than 5 are at high risk of developing serious complications from the influenza virus, such as pneumonia and respiratory and kidney failure, according to the CDC. Scientists aren't sure why that is, but some suspect it's because children have a greater immunological response, so they're more likely to run a fever or experience tissue damage as their bodies try to fight off infection.\n\nThe majority of flu-related deaths in the US - between 70 and 85% - occur in people 65 years and older. According to the World Health Organization, about 80% of the deaths from the new coronavirus have occurred among people ages 60 and older.\n\nUnlike the flu, however, there is no vaccine to protect people from this new virus.\n\n\"If we can keep this virus away from the pediatric population, it will help stem this,\" Milstone said.\n\nEverything you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak in 30 seconds\n\nHealth experts issued an ominous warning about a coronavirus pandemic 3 months ago. The virus in their simulation killed 65 million people.\n\nThe outbreaks of both the Wuhan coronavirus and SARS likely started in Chinese wet markets.

They are overwhelmed, under-equipped, exhausted, and even dying.", "body": "These are the sacrifices that China's medical workers have made, and continue to make.\n\nDoctors and medical staff are feeling the toll of the deadly Wuhan coronavirus more than anybody except their patients.\n\nAs of Friday morning local time the virus, named after its epicenter in the city of Wuhan, had killed 635 people and infected nearly 31,000. As many as 1,000 of those infected were medical staff.\n\nSome workers who contracted the disease have died. More still are working in almost impossible conditions, without the protection or resources they need to control an epidemic. Here is the situation on the ground:\n\nAround the time the quarantine began, one doctor told BBC News: \"The hospitals have been flooding with patients, there are thousands, I haven't seen so many before.\n\n\"I am scared because this is a new virus and the figures are alarming.\"\n\nEarly in the outbreak, scientists had not yet realised that the virus could spread from human to human. During that time, many doctors didn't wear protective gear.\n\nAccording to Business Insider's Aria Bendix, China has less than two physicians for every 10,000 residents.\n\nOnly around 60% have undergraduate degrees and only about 10% have graduate degrees, a radical difference from in European and North American health systems.\n\nThese images show military medics volunteering to go to Wuhan:\n\nOn January 29, Business Insider's Will Martin reported that China had had deployed 4,130 medics from other parts of China to Hubei province, which contains Wuhan.\n\nIt was in the process of increasing the figure to 6,000, according to the country's National Health Commission.\n\n\"Many were not initially informed about the potential for people-to-person transmission, and even now we don't have enough protective gear, test kits, and other supplies,\" one Wuhan doctor told the South China Morning Post on January 24.\n\nThere were also too few testing kits for patients, making it very hard to distinguish a coronavirus case from any other flu or cold.\n\nPatients in Wuhan came to consider getting access to a testing kit as being like winning the lottery.\n\nSome hospitals have been pleading for donations of supplies from ordinary people. A social media post from The Wuhan Children's Hospital, cited by the BBC, said simply: \"Medical supplies are in short supply - help!\"\n\nSome staff complained on social media that hospitals were even running out of food and drink.\n\nA New York Times article dated February 6 cited reports of shortages at a makeshift quarantine facility in Wuhan.\n\nIt said that an exhibition center, converted to house patients, had inadequate heating, unreliably electricity, and evident shortages of medical staff and equipment.\n\nThe Times report said that Chinese authorities are becoming more militant about stifling criticism of its response, making it harder to work out which places have shortages.\n\nThis video shows one medical worker having a meltdown:\n\nThe unidentified doctor at the Wuhan No. 5 Hospital made an exasperated call to a supervisor, not long before the Lunar New Year.\n\nHe said he had just done four days' worth of work without a break, according to The Washington Post.\n\n\"I don't want to do this job any more. Just fire me! Kick me out, send me back home,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't I want to go home to celebrate the new year? Don't we want to live, too?\"\n\nThe newspaper said that a second reason to use adult diapers was to avoid the delicate process of taking off a hazmat suit, which could tear and ruin it.\n\nAn unnamed doctors shut herself away because of an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, according to Beijing-based therapist Candice Qin, wjo described her case to The Washington Post.\n\n\"I think it is a strain for every doctor and every nurse in Wuhan, both physically and mentally,\" Qin told The Post. \"We know that patients are worried, but we should bear in mind that doctors are just as human as well.\"\n\nThe nurse ended up passing the disease to her 70-year-old mother.\n\nThere was no space for her in a nearby hospital, and the woman resorted to posting on social media to shame officials into admitting her.\n\nLi caught the virus while treating patients in Wuhan for weeks. He died around 4 a.m. local time on Friday.\n\nHis loss was all the more painful because Li had tried to raise awareness of the virus early on, but had been punished by officials who wanted to suppress the news.\n\nIn December, when the virus was just being discovered, Li alerted a group of alumni from his medical school.\n\nBut he was taken in by police in Wuhan and forced to sign a letter acknowledging he was \"making false comments\" about the burgeoning epidemic.\n\nAfter his death, tributes to Li went viral on China's Weibo social media network, despite the strict censorship which the country often employs.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_frias@businessinsider.com", "name": "Lauren Frias",

"Drugmakers are dusting off their Ebola playbooks as they race to develop coronavirus treatments and vaccines. Here's how 5 top firms are tackling a contagion that's already killed 400.", "body": "Here's a rundown of these companies' approaches, which include repurposing existing drugs and creating new vaccines based on the genetic understanding of the novel virus.\n\nAs the Wuhan coronavirus has rapidly spread to kill hundreds and infect thousands, some of the leading drug developers have started working with US health authorities to research treatments.\n\nThe companies -- including Johnson & Johnson, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Gilead Sciences -- are taking a variety of approaches. Some are developing vaccines from scratch using info about the virus' genetic code. Others are testing existing drugs as near-term treatment options.\n\nWhile drug development is typically a multiyear process that faces significant hurdles, US health officials have been pushing speedy testing timelines. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) infectious disease center, said he hoped to start testing vaccine candidates in humans within the next three months.\n\nThat urgency stems from an outbreak that was recently declared a global public-health emergency by the World Health Organization. The coronavirus has infected more than 20,000 people and killed at least 426 and has spread to more than two dozen countries, including the US.\n\nHere's how five leading drugmakers are attempting to fight the virus.\n\nThe largest healthcare company is testing five ideas in hopes of finding an effective vaccine against the coronavirus, a leading research-and-development executive told CNBC on January 27.\n\n\"We are comfortable that we can create a vaccine and scale it up,\" Paul Stoffels, the chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson, said in a recent interview with CNBC.\n\nThe pharmaceutical firm is no stranger to developing vaccines for emerging crises. In the past, it has used its platforms to develop an investigational Ebola vaccine that has now been given to thousands of people in Africa, as well as vaccine candidates for HIV and respiratory syncytial virus.\n\nAdditionally, the company donated 350 boxes of Prezcobix, its HIV therapy, to Chinese hospitals and health officials. J&J said the motivation for the donations stemmed from anecdotal accounts that a certain type of antiviral has worked against similar coronaviruses in the past, such as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n\nRegeneron and the US Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday added the coronavirus to an agreement to develop antibodies against the leading public-health threats.\n\nWith that expansion, the biotech-industry leader has started its efforts to counteract the virus.\n\nRegeneron, which is based in Tarrytown, New York, worked with US health officials in developing a treatment that showed some success in countering Ebola.\n\nFor this new coronavirus, Regeneron is exploring two routes, a company spokesperson told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nFirst, Regeneron researchers will work to discover new antibodies against the disease. To speed up early testing, the biotech plans to test the drug candidates in genetically engineered mice that have immune systems similar to people.\n\nRegeneron approached Ebola in a similar way. It took about six months for the company to develop the new treatment and validate its effectiveness in animals and then another six months to become ready for use in humans, a company spokesperson said.\n\nThe second approach is to test existing antibodies against the virus, such as a previous treatment Regeneron developed for MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. The new coronavirus has shown differences with MERS, so the likelihood of success on this front may not be particularly high, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe California biotech Gilead is looking into repurposing an antiviral drug that was previously tested against Ebola.\n\nOver the weekend, Gilead started a randomized trial testing the drug remdesivir against a placebo in 270 patients with mild to moderate pneumonia associated with the coronavirus.\n\nWhile a single case reported in The New England Journal of Medicine has stirred excitement about remdesivir's potential, Geoffrey Porges, an SVB Leerink biotech analyst, cautioned against reading too much into one patient.\n\n\"It is complicated to ascribe efficacy to a single drug from one anecdotal report, especially given the complex disease course, potential for resolution on its own, and multiple other therapies on board,\" Porges wrote in a February 3 note to investors.\n\nGilead also said the drug has shown activity in animals against similar viruses like MERS and SARS.\n\nThe British drugmaker isn't developing its own vaccine but looking to support other efforts.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline said on February 3 it would supply some of its technology to aid other vaccine efforts in coordination with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a group that has been backing efforts to find vaccines.\n\nRead more: A coalition backed by Bill Gates is funding biotechs that are scrambling to develop vaccines for the deadly Wuhan coronavirus\n\nIn particular, GSK will offer up its pandemic vaccine adjuvant platform. Adjuvants are added to vaccines to boost immune responses and typically help build a stronger, longer-lasting effect. That also allows for smaller doses to be used per person, making vaccines available to more people, CEPI said.\n\n\"Our adjuvant technology has previously been used successfully in the pandemic flu setting,\" Thomas Breuer, the chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines, said. \"It enables using only small quantities of the vaccine antigen, which allows the production of more doses of the vaccine -- a crucial advantage in a pandemic.\"\n\nWhile the rest of the drugmakers on this list have decades of experience getting drugs through testing and delivering them to patients, the buzzy biotech Moderna will be testing its new technology against this public-health threat.\n\nThe $7 billion biotech went public in 2018 based on the promises of its novel genetic approach to therapeutics.\n\nThe platform, called messenger RNA, is now being used to develop a vaccine candidate with financial support from the NIH and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.\n\nThe NIH will then lead the first in-human studies of the vaccine with a primary focus on safety and tolerability.\n\nThe biotech believes its technology can accelerate the process and quickly produce a vaccine against the coronavirus.\n\n\"It's really a big step forward compared to traditional vaccines,\" Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told Business Insider, adding that drugmakers typically invent a manufacturing process almost from scratch for each vaccine.\n\nWith more than 500 publicly traded companies, the long tail of the biotech industry has also gotten involved in developing treatments against the coronavirus.\n\nThese companies haven't brought any drugs to market and have significantly limited resources compared with industry-leading pharma and biotech companies, particularly in terms of their ability to run trials in many people or manufacture vaccines or drugs.\n\nIn addition to Moderna, CEPI is also working with and awarded funding to vaccine development efforts by Inovio, a small Pennsylvania biotech, and CureVac, a German drug developer also looking at a messenger RNA therapeutic approach.\n\nCEPI is still seeking to fund more ideas and published a call on Monday for additional vaccine proposals with a February 14 deadline.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri":
