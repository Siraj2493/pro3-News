He was yelling an expletive about China. Then a bus passed, she recalled, and he screamed after it, \"Run them over.\"\n\nShe tried to keep her distance, but when the light changed, she was stuck waiting with him at the crosswalk. She could feel him staring at her. And then, suddenly, she felt it: his saliva hitting her face and her favorite sweater.\n\nIn shock, Zhu, who is 26 and moved to the United States from China five years ago, hurried the rest of the way to the gym. She found a corner where no one could see her, and she cried quietly.\n\n\"That person didn't look strange or angry or anything, you know?\" she said of her tormentor. \"He just looked like a normal person.\"\n\nAs the coronavirus upends American life, Chinese Americans face a double threat. Not only are they grappling like everyone else with how to avoid the virus itself, they are also contending with growing racism in the form of verbal and physical attacks. Other Asian Americans -- with families from Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and other places -- are facing threats, too, lumped together with Chinese Americans by a bigotry that does not know the difference.\n\nIn interviews over the past week, nearly two dozen Asian Americans across the country said they were afraid -- to go grocery shopping, to travel alone on subways or buses, to let their children go outside. Many described being yelled at in public -- a sudden spasm of hate that is reminiscent of the kind faced by Muslim Americans and other Arabs and South Asians after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nBut unlike 2001, when President George W. Bush urged tolerance of Muslim Americans, this time President Donald Trump is using language that Asian Americans say is inciting racist attacks.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies are intent on calling the coronavirus \"the Chinese virus,\" rejecting the World Health Organization's guidance against using geographic locations when naming illnesses, since past names have provoked a backlash.\n\nTrump told reporters Tuesday that he was calling the virus \"Chinese\" to combat a disinformation campaign by Beijing officials saying the U.S. military was the source of the outbreak. He dismissed concerns that his language would lead to any harm.\n\n\"If they keep using these terms, the kids are going to pick it up,\" said Tony Du, an epidemiologist in Howard County, Maryland, who fears for his son, Larry. \"They are going to call my 8-year-old son a Chinese virus. It's serious.\"\n\nDu said he posted on Facebook that \"this is the darkest day in my 20-plus years of life in the United States,\" referring to Trump's doubling down on use of the term.\n\nWhile no firm numbers exist yet, Asian American advocacy groups and researchers say there has been a surge of verbal and physical assaults reported in newspapers and to tip lines.\n\nSan Francisco State University found a 50% rise in the number of news articles related to the coronavirus and anti-Asian discrimination between Feb. 9 and March 7. The lead researcher, Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American studies, said the figures represented \"just the tip of the iceberg\" because only the most egregious cases would be likely to be reported by the media.\n\nJeung has helped set up a website in six Asian languages, to gather firsthand accounts; some 150 cases have been reported on the site since it was started last Thursday.\n\nBenny Luo, founder and chief executive of NextShark, a website focused on Asian American news, said the site used to get a few tips a day. Now it is dozens.\n\n\"We've never received this many news tips about racism against Asians,\" he said. \"It's crazy. My staff is pulling double duty just to keep up.\" He said he was hiring two more people to help.\n\nNo one is immune to being targeted. Dr. Edward Chew, head of the emergency department at a large Manhattan hospital, is on the front lines of fighting the coronavirus. He said that over the past few weeks, he had noticed people trying to cover their nose and mouth with their shirts when they are near him.\n\nChew has been using his free time to buy protective gear, like goggles and face shields, for his staff, in case his hospital runs out. On Wednesday night at a Home Depot, with his cart filled with face shields, masks and Tyvek suits, he said he was harassed by three men in their 20s, who then followed him into the parking lot.\n\n\"I heard of other Asians being assaulted over this, but when you are actually ridiculed yourself, you really feel it,\" he said the following day.\n\nA writer for The New Yorker, Jiayang Fan, said she was taking out her trash last week when a man walking by began cursing at her for being Chinese.\n\n\"I've never felt like this in my 27 years in this country,\" she wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. \"I've never felt afraid to leave my home to take out the trash because of my face.\"\n\nAttacks have also gotten physical.\n\nIn the San Fernando Valley in California, a 16-year old Asian American boy was attacked in school by bullies who accused him of having the coronavirus. He was sent to the emergency room to see whether he had suffered a concussion.\n\nIn New York City a woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched in a Manhattan subway station, and a man in Queens was followed to a bus stop, shouted at and then hit over the head in front of his 10-year-old son.\n\nPeople have rushed to protect themselves. One man started a buddy-system Facebook group for Asians in New York who are afraid to take the subway by themselves. Gun shop owners in the Washington, D.C., area said they were seeing a surge of first-time Chinese American buyers.\n\nAt Engage Armament in Rockville, Maryland, most gun buyers in the first two weeks of March have been Chinese American or Chinese, according to the owner, Andy Raymond.\n\nMore than a fifth of Rockville's residents are of Asian ethnicity, and Raymond said buyers from Korean and Vietnamese backgrounds were not unusual. But Raymond said he was stunned by the flow of Chinese customers -- in particular green-card holders from mainland China -- that began earlier this month, a group that rarely patronized his shop before.\n\n\"It was just nonstop, something I've never seen,\" he said.\n\nRaymond said that few of the Asian customers wanted to talk about why they were there, but when one of his employees asked a woman about it, she teared up. \"To protect my daughter,\" she replied.\n\nFor recent immigrants like Du who are in close touch with friends and family in China, the virus has been a screaming danger for weeks that most Americans seemed oblivious to.\n\nDu is trying to remain hopeful. He spends his weekends training to become a volunteer with Maryland's emergency medical workers. He is part of a group of Chinese American scientists who organized a GoFundMe account to raise money for protective gear for hospital workers in the area. In three days, they raised more than $55,000, nearly all in small donations.\n\nBut he said he was afraid of the chaos that could be unleashed if the U.S. death toll rises significantly.\n\nAlready a gun owner, Du, 48, said he was in the process of buying an AR-15 style rifle.\n\n\"Katrina is not far away,\" he said, alluding to the unrest in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \"And when all these bad things come, I am a minority. People can see my face is Chinese clearly. My son, when he goes out, they will know his parents are Chinese.\"\n\nFor American-born Asians, there is a sudden sense of being watched that is as unsettling as it is unfamiliar.\n\n\"It's a look of disdain,\" said Chil Kong, a Korean American theater director in Maryland. \"It's just: 'How dare you exist in my world? You are a reminder of this disease, and you don't belong in my world.' \"\n\nHe added: \"It's especially hard when you grow up here and expect this world to be yours equally. But we do not live in that world anymore. That world does not exist.\"\n\nOne debate among Asian Americans has been over whether to wear a mask in public. Wearing one risks drawing unwanted attention; but not wearing one does, too. Zhu said her parents, who live in China, offered to ship her some.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Oh please, don't,' \" she said. She said she was afraid of getting physically attacked if she wore one. \"Lots of my friends, their social media posts are all about this: We don't wear masks. It's kind of more dangerous than the virus.\"\n\nA 30-year-old videographer in Syracuse said he was still shaken from a trip to the grocery store, when the man ahead of him in the checkout line shouted at him, \"It's you people who brought the disease,\" and other customers just stared at him, without offering to help. That same day, he said, two different couples verbally abused him at Costco.\n\n\"I feel like I'm being invaded by this hatred,\" said the man, Edward, who asked that his last name not be used because he feared attracting more attention. \"It's everywhere. It's silent. It's as deadly as this disease.\"\n\nHe said he had tried to hide the details of what happened from his mother, who moved to the United States from China in the 1970s. But there was one thing he did tell her.\n\n\"I told her, whatever you do, you can't go shopping,\" he said. \"She needed to know there's a problem, and we can't act like it's normal anymore.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sabrina_tavernise@nytimes.com", "name": "Sabrina Tavernise", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islam in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Languages of Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_American_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian American studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Here's What Happens if We Do.", "body": "Note: \"Social distancing\" also includes a reduction in large gatherings; some school closures and working from home; and efforts to support hospitals and diagnostic testing. Based on a simulation between January and late October using an epidemic model. See full methodology for details.\n\nPresident Trump says he wants the United States \"raring to go\" in two and a half weeks, on Easter, with \"packed churches all over our country.\" He and many other political conservatives suggest that we are responding to something like the flu with remedies that may be more devastating than the disease.\n\nWe created this interactive model with epidemiologists to show why quickly returning to normal could be a historic mistake that would lead to an explosion of infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nInstead, health experts advise giving current business closures and social distancing a month to slow the pandemic, buying time to roll out mass testing and equip doctors with protective equipment. Then, depending on where we are, we can think about easing up - while prepared for a new burst of infections that will then require a new clampdown.\n\nPlay with this model below by moving the slider to change the length of time that controls are in effect, and you'll see the impact on lives lost.\n\nUsing the length of time you chose, the model has wavered into unrealistic territory: it suggests that people could contract the coronavirus across the between January and late October (with at the peak on ). More than people would die under these conditions and people would recover. Tweak the settings, and these numbers will change. (Perhaps you should try a more realistic scenario.)\n\nThese numbers offer a false precision, for we don't understand Covid-19 well enough to model it exactly. But they do suggest the point that epidemiologists are making: For all the yearning for a return to normalcy, that is risky so long as a virus is raging and we are unprotected.\n\n\"Anyone advising the end of social distancing now needs to fully understand what the country will look like if we do that,\" cautioned Dr. Tom Inglesby, a health security expert at Johns Hopkins University. \"Covid would spread widely, rapidly, terribly, and could kill potentially millions in the year ahead, with huge social and economic impact.\"\n\n[During these extraordinary times, Opinion columnists and writers will be going live on Twitter every weekday at 1 p.m. Eastern to chat with viewers. Join Nicholas Kristof on Thursday: @NickKristof.]\n\nA skeptic will note that these measures don't seem to prevent a surge in infections so much as delay them (in some cases so that the impact is pushed beyond the period that this model tracks). There's something to that: We may see a resurgence whenever we let up, at least until we have a vaccine or herd immunity.\n\nYet social distancing still is beneficial in two ways.\n\nFirst, we can use the time to buttress hospitals and test treatments. Second, interventions can flatten the curve and spread infections over a longer period of time, so that the health care system does not become overwhelmed.\n\nWhatever we do, the pain of both disease and business and school closures may be enormous. During the Great Depression, the unemployment rate in the United States reached 25 percent; today, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, James Bullard, warns that it might reach 30 percent. People may lose their jobs, savings and homes; they will go without parties, weddings, funerals and graduations that give life connectedness and meaning. But we know quite a bit about how to ease economic pain: We can send out checks to individuals, and we can incentivize companies to keep workers on the payrolls. Both steps are part of legislation being considered in Washington.\n\nSome prominent conservatives have suggested that it is worth sacrificing some elderly people to keep the economy moving. \"I'd rather die than kill the country,\" Glenn Beck told viewers.\n\nBut that view reflects two fallacies. First, the fundamental force damaging the economy is not the rulebook on social distancing but rather an out-of-control virus, and the best way to protect the economy is to rein in the pandemic. Second, while these critics speak nobly about sacrificing themselves, the policies they advocate would more likely lead to the deaths of many other people who are older and in poorer shape.\n\nIt is a false choice to say that we must accept the deaths of senior citizens to keep small businesses going. And any easing of social distancing should be based on data.\n\nDr. Larry Brilliant, an epidemiologist who is a veteran of the eradication of smallpox and is now the chairman of an organization called Ending Pandemics, warned that if Trump sends everyone back to work by Easter, \"I think history would judge it an error of epic proportions.\"\n\nBrilliant said that the entire country probably does not need to be shut down, but that we need widespread testing to determine which areas are at risk and which are not. We also desperately need blood testing to determine who has had the disease and is now immune.\n\nIf Covid-19 is as fearsome as some believe, our model suggests a grim possibility: It may be that the only way to control it sustainably is with an economic pause too long to be politically sustainable. In that case, we may be headed for a year of alternating periods of easing and tightening economic activity, with the pandemic rising whenever we ease and subsiding whenever we tighten.\n\nDr. David N. Fisman, a University of Toronto epidemiologist who helped us build this model, suggests that for the next year we may have to tighten social distancing whenever I.C.U. capacity is stretched, and then loosen it when the situation improves. \"This gives the economy and the population 'breaks' so that people can breathe and businesses can operate,\" Fisman said.\n\nThere are some hopeful signs that social distancing and business closures can turn the tide, and not just in South Korea and Singapore. In Italy, confirmed new cases have started to drop. And the number of positive test results conducted by the University of Washington, in hard-hit Seattle, has stabilized.\n\nTrump seems to be pushing for a relaxation of restrictions partly based on his repeated comparisons of Covid-19 to the flu, warning that \"we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.\" Meanwhile, the Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel scoffed this month about the coronavirus: \"worst-case scenario, it could be the flu.\"\n\nModeling the virus underscores why epidemiologists emphasize that this is not the flu and why we should not expect a return to normal within weeks.\n\nOne gauge of a virus is how contagious it is. The flu has an infectiousness measure (or R0) of only about 1.5, meaning that each sick person infects on average 1.5 others. In contrast, Covid-19 without social distancing appears to have an R0 of perhaps 2.5.\n\nA second gauge of a virus is how often infected people must be hospitalized. With the seasonal flu that's roughly 1 percent; with the coronavirus, estimates range from 5 percent to 20 percent.\n\nA higher R0 and higher hospitalization rate conspire to wreak havoc. A single person with the flu can result in the infections of 386 other people over two months, and a handful would be hospitalized. But in that same period one Covid-19 patient could lead to the infections of 99,000 people, of whom nearly 20,000 might need to be hospitalized.\n\nA third measure is lethality, the \"case fatality rate,\" or percentage of people who contract an illness who eventually die of it. For the flu, this is about 0.1 percent. For Covid-19, there are enormous uncertainties but even in optimal circumstances it may be 10 times greater, roughly 1 percent - although it has been much higher than that in countries like Italy with older populations and overburdened hospitals.\n\nHere is the full model. You can play with the sliders and see how outcomes change.\n\n(Using the settings you chose, the model has wavered into unrealistic territory: it suggests that people could contract coronavirus across the between January and late October (with at the peak on ). More than people would die under these conditions and people would recover.)\n\nWe asked Dr. Tara C. Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University, what she would advise a bride and groom whose long-planned wedding is imminent, especially if they can't afford to reschedule. \"They should think about putting other people at risk,\" she said, \"and what would they think if there was an outbreak because of something happy like a wedding.\"\n\nThese are not questions we wrestle with each flu season.\n\nWe're living through an extraordinary time, forced to make difficult trade-offs with uncertain information - and one lesson of past pandemics is that early \"knowledge\" of diseases is often wrong. Yet another lesson of history is the value of responding to pandemics early and firmly. In the 1918 flu pandemic, those cities like St. Louis, Mo., that acted decisively saved many lives. In this crisis, parts of the world like South Korea and Taiwan that acted resolutely have managed far better than those that were more relaxed, like Italy, Iran and the United States.\n\nThat's why epidemiologists and public health experts warn against relaxing too soon. Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a global health expert at Baylor College of Medicine, calls for maintaining controls for at least another month and then reassessing.\n\nLife is about making difficult decisions in the context of uncertainty, and we hope this model will help you appreciate the trade-offs -- and the significance of sustained efforts for social distancing not only by the president but also by each of us in our own lives.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_kristof@nytimes.com", "name": "Nicholas Kristof", "type": "author",

now the epicenter of the pandemic.\n\nScientists warned that the United States someday would become the country hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. That moment arrived on Thursday.\n\nIn the United States, at least 81,321 people are known to have been infected with the coronavirus, including more than 1,000 deaths -- more cases than China, Italy or any other country has seen, according to data gathered by The New York Times.\n\nWith 330 million residents, the United States is the world's third most populous nation, meaning it provides a vast pool of people who can potentially get Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nAnd it is a sprawling, cacophonous democracy, where states set their own policies and President Trump has sent mixed messages about the scale of the danger and how to fight it, ensuring there was no coherent, unified response to a grave public health threat.\n\nAlthough the American medical system is unsurpassed and its public health system has a reputation as one of the finest in the world, a series of missteps and lost opportunities dogged the nation's response.\n\nAmong them: a failure to take the pandemic seriously even as it engulfed China, a deeply flawed effort to provide broad testing for the virus that left the country blind to the extent of the crisis, and a dire shortage of masks and protective gear to protect doctors and nurses on the front lines, as well as ventilators to keep the critically ill alive.\n\nChina's leaders, stung by the SARS epidemic in 2003 and several bird flu scares since then, had a deeply flawed early response to the outbreak that began in the city of Wuhan, with local officials suppressing news of the outbreak.\n\nBut China's autocratic government acted with ferocious intensity after the belated start. Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan quickly began preparing for the worst.\n\nThe United States instead remained preoccupied with business as usual. Impeachment. Harvey Weinstein. Brexit and the Oscars.\n\nOnly a few virologists recognized the threat for what it was. The virus was not influenza, but it had the hallmarks of the Spanish flu: relatively low lethality, but relentlessly transmissible.\n\nCellphone videos leaking out of China showed what was happening as it spread in Wuhan: dead bodies on hospital floors, doctors crying in frustration, rows of unattended coffins outside the crematories.\n\nWhat the cameras missed -- in part because Beijing made Western journalists' lives difficult by withholding visas and imposing quarantines -- was the slow, relentless way China's public health system was hunting down the virus, case by case, cluster by cluster, city by city.\n\nFor now, at least, China has contained the coronavirus with draconian measures. But the pathogen had embarked on a Grand Tour of most countries on Earth, with devastating epidemics in Iran, Italy, France. More videos emerged of prostrate victims, exhausted nurses and lines of coffins.\n\nThe United States, which should have been ready, was not.\n\nThere was no Pentagon ready to fight the war on this pandemic, no wartime draft law. There was eventually a White House Coronavirus Task Force, but it has been led by politicians, not medical experts.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is one of the great disease-detective agencies in the world, and its doctors have contributed mightily in skirmishes against Ebola, Zika and any number of other health threats.\n\nBut the agency retreated into silence, its director, Dr. Robert Redfield, almost invisible -- humbled by a fiasco in the failure to produce basic diagnostic testing.\n\nNow at least 160 million Americans have been ordered to stay home in states from California to New York. Schools are closed, often along with bars, restaurants and many other businesses. Hospitals are coping with soaring numbers of patients in New York City, even as supplies of essential protective gear and equipment dwindle.\n\nOther hospitals, other communities fear what may be coming.\n\nThe world will be a different place when the pandemic is over. India may surpass the United States as the country with the most deaths. Like the United States, it, too, is a vast, democracy with deep internal divisions. But its population, 1.3 billion, is far larger, and its people are crowded even more tightly into megacities.\n\nChina could still stumble into a new round of contagion as its economy restarts, and be forced to do it all again.\n\nIn the meantime, with the virus loose in the streets while millions of Americans huddle indoors, when will it be safe to come out and go back to work?\n\n\"The virus will tell us,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical School.\n\nWhen a baseline of daily testing is established across the country, a drop in the percentage of positive tests will signal that the virus has found as many hosts as it can for the moment, and is beginning to recede.\n\nWhen hospital admissions have hit a clear peak and begun to plateau, \"we can feel optimistic,\" Dr. Schaffner said. \"And when they begin to drop, we can begin to smile.\"\n\nThat moment may arrive this summer. But as soon as the first of Americans begin venturing cautiously out, we will have to start planning for the second wave.\n\nPlease check back for updates to this developing story.", "source": {"uri":

Outbreak\n\nAt a White House briefing on the coronavirus on March 20, President Trump called the State Department the \"Deep State Department.\" Behind him, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, dropped his head and rubbed his forehead.\n\nSome thought Dr. Fauci was slighting the president, leading to a vitriolic online reaction. On Twitter and Facebook, a post that falsely claimed he was part of a secret cabal who opposed Mr. Trump was soon shared thousands of times, reaching roughly 1.5 million people.\n\nA week later, Dr. Fauci -- the administration's most outspoken advocate of emergency measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak -- has become the target of an online conspiracy theory that he is mobilizing to undermine the president.\n\nThat fanciful claim has spread across social media, fanned by a right-wing chorus of Mr. Trump's supporters, even as Dr. Fauci has won a public following for his willingness to contradict the president and correct falsehoods and overly rosy pronouncements about containing the virus.\n\nAn analysis by The New York Times found over 70 accounts on Twitter that have promoted the hashtag #FauciFraud, with some tweeting as frequently as 795 times a day. The anti-Fauci sentiment is being reinforced by posts from Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group; Bill Mitchell, host of the far-right online talk show \"YourVoice America\"; and other outspoken Trump supporters such as Shiva Ayyadurai, who has falsely claimed to be the inventor of email.\n\nMany of the anti-Fauci posts, some of which pointed to a seven-year-old email that Dr. Fauci had sent praising Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of State, have been retweeted thousands of times. On YouTube, conspiracy-theory videos about Dr. Fauci have racked up hundreds of thousands of views in the past week. In private Facebook groups, posts disparaging him have also been shared hundreds of times and liked by thousands of people, according to the Times analysis.\n\nOne anti-Fauci tweet on Tuesday said, \"Sorry liberals but we don't trust Dr. Anthony Fauci.\"\n\nThe torrent of falsehoods aimed at discrediting Dr. Fauci is another example of the hyperpartisan information flow that has driven a wedge into the way Americans think. For the past few years, far-right supporters of President Trump have regularly vilified those whom they see as opposing him. Even so, the campaign against Dr. Fauci stands out because he is one of the world's leading infectious disease experts and a member of Mr. Trump's virus task force, and it is unfolding as the government battles a pathogen that is rapidly spreading in the United States.\n\nIt is the latest twist in the ebb and flow of right-wing punditry that for weeks echoed Mr. Trump in minimizing the threat posed by the coronavirus and arguably undercut efforts to alert the public of its dangers. When the president took a more assertive posture against the outbreak, conservative outlets shifted, too -- but now accuse Democrats and journalists of trying to use the pandemic to damage Mr. Trump politically.\n\n\"There seems to be a concerted effort on the part of Trump supporters to spread misinformation about the virus aggressively,\" said Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington who has studied misinformation.\n\nAdding that Dr. Fauci is bearing the brunt of the attacks, Mr. Bergstrom said: \"There is this sense that experts are untrustworthy, and have agendas that aren't aligned with the people. It's very concerning because the experts in this are being discounted out of hand.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Markets and Business Despite a bailout, airline executives offer a bleak outlook.

See more updates Updated 48h ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nThe Trump administration has previously shown a distaste for relying on scientific expertise, such as when dealing with climate change. But misinformation campaigns during a pandemic carry a unique danger because they may sow distrust in public health officials when accurate information and advice are crucial, said Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who teaches digital ethics.\n\n\"What this case will show is that conspiracy theories can kill,\" she said.\n\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases did not respond to a request for comment on the misinformation being directed at Dr. Fauci, who has said he plans to keep working to contain the coronavirus.\n\n\"When you're dealing with the White House, sometimes you have to say things one, two, three, four times, and then it happens,\" Dr. Fauci said in an interview with Science magazine this past week. \"So, I'm going to keep pushing.\"\n\nThe online campaign is an abrupt shift for Dr. Fauci, an immunologist who has led the institute since 1984. He has long been seen as credible by a large section of the public and journalists, advising every president since Ronald Reagan and encouraging action against the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s.\n\nIn recent weeks, much of the online discussion of Dr. Fauci was benign or positive. Zignal Labs, a media analysis company, studied 1.7 million mentions of Dr. Fauci across the web and TV broadcasts from Feb. 27 to Friday and found that through mid-March, he was mainly praised and his comments were straightforwardly reported. Right-wing figures quoted Dr. Fauci approvingly or lauded him for his comments on shutting down travel to and from China, Zignal Labs said.\n\nIn the White House briefings on the coronavirus, he often spoke plainly of the severity of the situation, becoming something of a folk hero to some on the left. Then Dr. Fauci, who had been a steady presence at Mr. Trump's side during the briefings, did not appear at the one on March 18.\n\nA hashtag asking \"Where is Dr. Fauci?\" began trending on Twitter. Several Facebook fan groups dedicated to praising his medical record called for his return. The first accounts tweeting #FauciFraud also appeared, though their volume of posts was small, according to the Times analysis.\n\nTwo days later, Dr. Fauci put his head in his hand at the White House briefing after Mr. Trump's remark on the \"Deep State Department.\" His gesture -- some called it a face palm -- caught the attention of Mr. Trump's supporters online, who saw it as an insult to the president.\n\nAnti-Fauci posts spiked, according to Zignal Labs. Much of the increase was prompted by a March 21 article in The American Thinker, a conservative blog, which published the seven-year-old email that Dr. Fauci had written to an aide of Mrs. Clinton.\n\nIn the email, Dr. Fauci praised Mrs. Clinton for her stamina during the 2013 Benghazi hearings. The American Thinker falsely claimed that the email was evidence that he was part of a secret group who opposed Mr. Trump.\n\nThat same day, Mr. Fitton of Judicial Watch posted a tweet linking to a different blog post that showed Dr. Fauci's email on Mrs. Clinton. In the tweet, Mr. Fitton included a video of himself crossing his arms and saying, \"Isn't that interesting.\" It was retweeted more than 1,500 times.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Fitton said, \"Dr. Fauci is doing a great job.\" He added that Dr. Fauci \"wrote very political statements to Hillary Clinton that were odd for an appointee of his nature to send.\"\n\nThe conspiracy theory was soon shared thousands of times across Facebook and Twitter. It was also taken up by messaging groups on WhatsApp and Facebook run by QAnon, the anonymous group that claims to be privy to government secrets. On YouTube, far-right personalities began spouting that Dr. Fauci was a fraud.\n\nBy Tuesday, the online and television mentions of Dr. Fauci had declined but had become consistently negative, Zignal Labs said.\n\nOne anti-Fauci tweet last Sunday read: \"Dr. Fauci is in love w/ crooked @HillaryClinton. More reasons not to trust him.\"\n\nFacebook said it proactively removed misinformation related to the coronavirus. YouTube said that it did not recommend the conspiracy-theory videos on Dr. Fauci to viewers and that it promotes credible virus information. Twitter said it remained \"focused on taking down content that can lead to harm.\"\n\nMs. Phillips, the Syracuse assistant professor, said the campaign was part of a long-term conspiracy theory propagated by Mr. Trump's followers.\n\n\"Fauci has just been particularly prominent,\" she said. \"But any public health official who gets cast in a conspiratorial narrative is going to be subject to those same kinds of suspicions, the same kinds of doubt.\"\n\nThat has not stopped Dr. Fauci from appearing on the internet. On Thursday, he joined a 30-minute Instagram Live discussion about the coronavirus hosted by the National Basketball Association star Stephen Curry.\n\nIn the session, Dr. Fauci, with a miniature basketball hoop behind him, conveyed the same message that he had said for weeks about the outbreak.\n\n\"This is serious business,\" he said. \"We are not overreacting.\"\n\nBen Decker contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "davey_alba@nytimes.com", "name": "Davey Alba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nLYNCHBURG, Va. -- As Liberty University's spring break was drawing to a close this month, Jerry Falwell Jr., its president, spoke with the physician who runs Liberty's student health service about the rampaging coronavirus.\n\n\"We've lost the ability to corral this thing,\" Dr. Thomas W. Eppes Jr. said he told Mr. Falwell. But he did not urge him to close the school. \"I just am not going to be so presumptuous as to say, 'This is what you should do and this is what you shouldn't do,'\" Dr. Eppes said in an interview.\n\nSo Mr. Falwell -- a staunch ally of President Trump and an influential voice in the evangelical world -- reopened the university last week, igniting a firestorm. As of Friday, Dr. Eppes said, nearly a dozen Liberty students were sick with symptoms that suggested Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Three were referred to local hospital centers for testing. Another eight were told to self-isolate.\n\n\"Liberty will be notifying the community as deemed appropriate and required by law,\" Mr. Falwell said in an interview on Sunday when confronted with the numbers. He added that any student now returning to campus would be required to self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\n\"I can't be sure what's going on with individuals who are not being tested but who are advised to self-isolate,\" said Kerry Gateley, the health director of the Central Virginia Health District, which covers Lynchburg. \"I would assume that if clinicians were concerned enough about the possibility of Covid-19 disease to urge self-isolation that appropriate screening and testing would be arranged.\"\n\nAfter initial publication of this article, the university said it had asked four students who returned from the New York area and two of their roommates to self-quarantine, but none of them were referred for testing and none had symptoms. One student who returned from a county with a high number of cases was running a fever and had a cough. He was tested and elected to go home pending the results rather than self-isolate, the university said.\n\nOf the 1,900 students who initially returned last week to campus, Mr. Falwell said more than 800 had left. But he said he had \"no idea\" how many students had returned to off-campus housing.\n\n\"If I were them, I'd be more nervous,\" he added, because they live in more crowded conditions.\n\nFor critical weeks in January and February, the nation's far right dismissed the seriousness of the pandemic. Mr. Falwell derided it as an \"overreaction\" driven by liberal desires to damage Mr. Trump.\n\nThough the current crisis would appear epidemiological in nature, Dr. Eppes said he saw it as a reflection of \"the political divide.\"\n\n\"If Liberty sneezes, there are people who don't like the fact that Liberty sneezed,\" he said in an interview. \"Mr. Falwell called me to listen to a view that wasn't exactly his. Great leaders do that type of thing.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Trump extended the federal government's social-distancing guidelines through the end of April. Mayor Bill de Blasio and many other elected leaders stress their urgent need for medical supplies. With global cases passing 675,000, Syria reports its first coronavirus death. See more updates Updated 11m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nThe city of Lynchburg is furious.\n\n\"We had a firestorm of our own citizens who said, 'What's going on?'\" said Treney Tweedy, the mayor.\n\nSome Liberty officials accuse alarmed outsiders of playing politics. Ms. Tweedy has called Mr. Falwell \"reckless.\" And within the school, there are signs of panic.\n\n\"I'm not allowed to talk to you because I'm an employee here,\" one student living on campus wrote in an email. But, he pleaded, \"we need help to go home.\"\n\nUnder the Falwell family's leadership, Liberty University has grown in five decades from a modest Baptist college to an evangelical powerhouse with cash investments and endowments of nearly $2 billion, nearly 46,000 undergraduates and a campus that sprawls across Lynchburg and neighboring counties in Virginia. Total enrollment, including online students, exceeds 100,000.\n\nThe institution is a welcome and generous presence in this Blue Ridge Mountain region, where the percentage of Lynchburg residents living in poverty is twice the state average. Liberty and its Thomas Road Baptist Church donate goods and services, its medical students conduct free health screenings, and its students participate in city beautification, maintenance and charity projects.\n\nThe university was founded by Mr. Falwell's famous father as a bastion of social conservatism, one that was unabashedly combative as it trained what it called \"Champions for Christ.\" If anything, the younger Mr. Falwell has made it more so since his father's death.\n\nThe mayor and city manager here, Bonnie Svrcek, felt relieved two weeks ago, when Mr. Falwell assured them that he fully intended to comply with Virginia's public health directives and close the school to virtually all students, most of whom were scattering for spring break. Then he changed his mind.\n\n\"We think it's irresponsible for so many universities to just say 'closed, you can't come back,' push the problem off on other communities and sit there in their ivory towers,\" Mr. Falwell said on Wednesday on a radio show hosted by Todd Starnes, a far-right conspiracy theorist.\n\n\"We're conservative, we're Christian, and therefore we're being attacked,\" he said.\n\nMichael Gillette, a former mayor of Lynchburg and a bioethicist now working with its hospitals on rationing scarce ventilators, disagrees.\n\n\"To argue that criticism of Liberty is based on political bias is unfounded and unreasonable,\" he said. \"Liberty just did not take this threat as seriously as others have.\"\n\nGov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, Lynchburg city officials and a growing number of Liberty students, parents and employees have urged Mr. Falwell to reverse course, but such pleas have only prompted a stream of often conflicting statements.\n\n\"Our messages did change throughout the week as the governor's orders changed,\" Mr. Falwell said. \"We had to adapt.\"\n\nMr. Falwell initially said only international students or those with nowhere else to go would remain. Then he welcomed back a much larger group of about 1,900 students to campus housing last week, in addition to faculty members and staff. Others returned to off-campus rentals in Lynchburg.\n\nStudents who remained at home had to return last week to clean out their rooms, a requirement that was later relaxed. Faculty members were at first ordered back to campus, even though they would be teaching online. Then some were allowed to work from home.\n\nMr. Falwell also waffled on whether the school would issue refunds to students who did not return for the semester, before announcing on Friday that most would receive a $1,000 credit for next year's bills.\n\nMr. Falwell and his administration have worked to tamp down dissent. After a Liberty undergraduate, Calum Best, wrote on his personal Facebook page that students should receive refunds, he said Liberty's spokesman, Scott Lamb, called his cellphone to berate him. Asked about the call, Mr. Lamb said he was simply objecting to an error in the post, and Mr. Best was \"spinning.\"\n\nAfter Marybeth Davis Baggett, a professor, wrote an open letter asking the university's board of trustees to close the campus, Mr. Falwell mocked her on Twitter as \"the 'Baggett' lady.\"\n\nJeff Brittain, a Liberty parent, wrote on Twitter: \"I'm as right wing as they get, bud. But as a parent of three of your students, I think this is crazy, irresponsible and seems like a money grab.\" Mr. Falwell replied, calling him a \"dummy.\"\n\nAll of this has left even his critics scratching their heads.\n\n\"It's honestly hard to figure out what his motives are,\" Mr. Best, the student who wrote the Facebook post, said in an interview. \"If he had purely political motives, he's being way more conservative than even Trump is being right now. Trump is at least allowing doctors to say their piece. Jerry is not. It kind of shocks me at this point.\"\n\nOn campus, the administration says it is adhering to Virginia's public health mandates, but students are flouting them. While security guards appear to be enforcing state advisories requiring a six-foot distance from others and gatherings of no more than 10 people, students are still assembling in closer proximity to eat, play sports, study and use dormitory restrooms. Decals slapped on furniture that say \"Closed for Social Distancing\" have wound up on laptops and car bumpers. Study tables are farther apart, but shared computer terminals remain. While some students are trying to adhere to social distancing guidelines, they live in group houses, pile onto city buses and crowd the few businesses that remain open in Lynchburg.\n\nIt was not supposed to be that way. As the number of reported cases of the coronavirus in Virginia began rising, Ms. Tweedy said Mr. Falwell personally assured her that the school would not fully reopen. \"We have some students who cannot go anywhere or they have nowhere to go,\" she recalled his telling her. \"The number on that day was 300 or so students, and even if it was a few more, we said, 'OK, well, thank you.'\"\n\nBut as spring break drew to a close in mid-March, all Liberty students were encouraged to return.\n\n\"We never discussed numbers, and I never told them the dorms would be closed,\" Mr. Falwell said on Sunday. \"We're going to have to agree to disagree on what was said.\"\n\nMr. Falwell runs Liberty his own way, and his word is law. Professors are not tenured and can be fired at will. The administration controls the student newspaper.\n\nMr. Falwell echoes Mr. Trump's talking points on the coronavirus, which he often calls the \"flu.\"\n\n\"It's just strange to me how many are overreacting\" to the pandemic, Mr. Falwell said on \"Fox & Friends\" on March 10. \"It makes you wonder if there is a political reason for that. Impeachment didn't work and the Mueller report didn't work and Article 25 didn't work, and so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.\"\n\nLynchburg is particularly ill-prepared to become a hot spot. Hospitals in the region have a total of 1,174 beds, only 55 of them intensive care, according to a recent analysis by the Harvard Global Health Institute. Those must serve 217,000 adults, nearly 50,000 of whom are 65 or older. Tests for the coronavirus remain in short supply.\n\nMr. Falwell has played down the dangers of his decision in interviews with the news media, where he has even suggested that the coronavirus is a North Korean bioweapon. On Fox News, he blithely asserted that the cure rate for Covid-19 \"is 99.7 percent for people under 50,\" adding, \"We have talked to medical professionals, numerous medical professionals, before we made this decision.\"\n\nAn archived version of Liberty's website said those medical professionals included the school's own public health faculty and campus health providers, as well as \"Dr. Jeffrey Hyman of Northwell Health, New York's largest health care provider.\"\n\nWhen contacted by The New York Times, Northwell Health denied that Dr. Hyman provided any formal guidance to Liberty, adding that he is not an infectious disease specialist. In a statement, the hospital system said that Dr. Hyman was a personal friend of the Falwell family, who told them in private conversation \"that reconvening classes would be a 'bad idea.'\"\n\nKristin Hussey contributed reporting.

Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- Yuanyuan Zhu was walking to her gym in San Francisco on March 9, thinking the workout could be her last for a while, when she noticed that a man was shouting at her. He was yelling an expletive about China. Then a bus passed, she recalled, and he screamed after it, \"Run them over.\"\n\nShe tried to keep her distance, but when the light changed, she was stuck waiting with him at the crosswalk. She could feel him staring at her. And then, suddenly, she felt it: his saliva hitting her face and her favorite sweater.\n\nIn shock, Ms. Zhu, who is 26 and moved to the United States from China five years ago, hurried the rest of the way to the gym. She found a corner where no one could see her, and she cried quietly.\n\n\"That person didn't look strange or angry or anything, you know?\" she said of her tormentor. \"He just looked like a normal person.\"\n\nAs the coronavirus upends American life, Chinese-Americans face a double threat. Not only are they grappling like everyone else with how to avoid the virus itself, they are also contending with growing racism in the form of verbal and physical attacks. Other Asian-Americans -- with families from Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and other places -- are facing threats, too, lumped together with Chinese-Americans by a bigotry that does not know the difference.\n\nIn interviews over the past week, nearly two dozen Asian-Americans across the country said they were afraid -- to go grocery shopping, to travel alone on subways or buses, to let their children go outside. Many described being yelled at in public -- a sudden spasm of hate that is reminiscent of the kind faced by Muslim-Americans and other Arabs and South Asians after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nBut unlike 2001, when President George W. Bush urged tolerance of Muslim-Americans, this time President Trump is using language that Asian-Americans say is inciting racist attacks.\n\nMr. Trump and his Republican allies are intent on calling the coronavirus \"the Chinese virus,\" rejecting the World Health Organization's guidance against using geographic locations when naming illnesses, since past names have provoked a backlash.\n\nMr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he was calling the virus \"Chinese\" to combat a disinformation campaign by Beijing officials saying the American military was the source of the outbreak. He dismissed concerns that his language would lead to any harm.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak U.S. lawmakers try again on a $1.8 trillion stimulus plan.

It's serious.\"\n\nMr. Du said he posted on Facebook that \"this is the darkest day in my 20-plus years of life in the United States,\" referring to Mr. Trump's doubling down on use of the term.\n\nWhile no firm numbers exist yet, Asian-American advocacy groups and researchers say there has been a surge of verbal and physical assaults reported in newspapers and to tip lines.\n\nSan Francisco State University found a 50 percent rise in the number of news articles related to the coronavirus and anti-Asian discrimination between Feb. 9 and March 7. The lead researcher, Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian-American studies, said the figures represented \"just the tip of the iceberg,\" because only the most egregious cases would be likely to be reported by the media.\n\nMr. Jeung has helped set up a website in six Asian languages, to gather firsthand accounts; some 150 cases have been reported on the site since it was started last Thursday.\n\nBenny Luo, founder and chief executive of NextShark, a website focused on Asian-American news, said the site used to get a few tips a day. Now it is dozens.\n\n\"We've never received this many news tips about racism against Asians,\" he said. \"It's crazy. My staff is pulling double duty just to keep up.\" He said he was hiring two more people to help.\n\nNo one is immune to being targeted. Dr. Edward Chew, the head of the emergency department at a large Manhattan hospital, is on the front lines of fighting the coronavirus. He said that over the past few weeks, he had noticed people trying to cover their nose and mouth with their shirts when they are near him.\n\nDr. Chew has been using his free time to buy protective gear, like goggles and face shields, for his staff, in case his hospital runs out. On Wednesday night at a Home Depot, with his cart filled with face shields, masks and Tyvek suits, he said he was harassed by three men in their 20s, who then followed him into the parking lot.\n\n\"I heard of other Asians being assaulted over this, but when you are actually ridiculed yourself, you really feel it,\" he said the following day.\n\nA writer for The New Yorker, Jiayang Fan, said she was taking out her trash last week when a man walking by began cursing at her for being Chinese.\n\n\"I've never felt like this in my 27 years in this country,\" she wrote on Twitter Tuesday. \"I've never felt afraid to leave my home to take out the trash because of my face.\"\n\nAttacks have also gotten physical.\n\nIn the San Fernando Valley in California, a 16-year old Asian-American boy was attacked in school by bullies who accused him of having the coronavirus. He was sent to the emergency room to see whether he had suffered a concussion.\n\nIn New York City a woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched in a Manhattan subway station, and a man in Queens was followed to a bus stop, shouted at and then hit over the head in front of his 10-year-old son.\n\nPeople have rushed to protect themselves. One man started a buddy-system Facebook group for Asians in New York who are afraid to take the subway by themselves. Gun shop owners in the Washington, D.C., area said they were seeing a surge of first-time Chinese-American buyers.\n\nAt Engage Armament in Rockville, Md., most gun buyers in the first two weeks of March have been Chinese-American or Chinese, according to the owner, Andy Raymond.\n\nMore than a fifth of Rockville's residents are of Asian ethnicity, and Mr. Raymond said buyers from Korean and Vietnamese backgrounds were not unusual. But Mr. Raymond said he was stunned by the flow of Chinese customers -- in particular green-card holders from mainland China -- that began earlier this month, a group that rarely patronized his shop before.\n\n\"It was just nonstop, something I've never seen,\" he said.\n\nMr. Raymond said that few of the Asian customers wanted to talk about why they were there, but when one of his employees asked a woman about it, she teared up. \"To protect my daughter,\" she replied.\n\nFor recent immigrants like Mr. Du who are in close touch with friends and family in China, the virus has been a screaming danger for weeks that most Americans seemed oblivious to.\n\nMr. Du is trying to remain hopeful. He spends his weekends training to become a volunteer with Maryland's emergency medical workers. He is part of a group of Chinese-American scientists who organized a GoFundMe account to raise money for protective gear for hospital workers in the area. In three days, they raised more than $55,000, nearly all in small donations.\n\nBut he said he was afraid of the chaos that could be unleashed if the United States death toll rises significantly.\n\nAlready a gun owner, Mr. Du, 48, said he was in the process of buying an AR-15 style rifle.\n\n\"Katrina is not far away,\" he said, alluding to the unrest in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \"And when all these bad things come, I am a minority. People can see my face is Chinese, clearly. My son, when he goes out, they will know his parents are Chinese.\"\n\nFor American-born Asians, there is a sudden sense of being watched that is as unsettling as it is unfamiliar.\n\n\"It's a look of disdain,\" said Chil Kong, a Korean-American theater director in Maryland. \"It's just: 'How dare you exist in my world? You are a reminder of this disease, and you don't belong in my world.'\"\n\nHe added: \"It's especially hard when you grow up here and expect this world to be yours equally. But we do not live in that world anymore. That world does not exist.\"\n\nOne debate among Asian-Americans has been over whether to wear a mask in public. Wearing one risks drawing unwanted attention; but not wearing one does, too. Ms. Zhu said her parents, who live in China, offered to ship her some.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Oh please, don't,'\" she said. She said she was afraid of getting physically attacked if she wore one. \"Lots of my friends, their social media posts are all about this: We don't wear masks. It's kind of more dangerous than the virus.\"\n\nA 30-year-old videographer in Syracuse said he was still shaken from a trip to the grocery store, when the man ahead of him in the checkout line shouted at him, \"It's you people who brought the disease,\" and other customers just stared at him, without offering to help. That same day, he said, two different couples verbally abused him at Costco.\n\n\"I feel like I'm being invaded by this hatred,\" said the man, Edward, who asked that his last name not be used because he feared attracting more attention. \"It's everywhere. It's silent. It's as deadly as this disease.\"\n\nHe said he had tried to hide the details of what happened from his mother, who moved to the United States from China in the 1970s. But there was one thing he did tell her.\n\n\"I told her, whatever you do, you can't go shopping,\" he said. \"She needed to know there's a problem and we can't act like it's normal anymore.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sabrina_tavernise@nytimes.com", "name": "Sabrina Tavernise", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islam in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Languages of Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_American_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian American studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

And It's Mitch McConnell's Fault.", "body": "The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky failed to do his job this weekend. As the economy spiraled downward, Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said he would produce a bipartisan bailout bill authorizing an infusion of desperately needed aid.\n\nInstead, Mr. McConnell emerged on Sunday evening with a bill that would provide a lot of help for corporate executives and shareholders, and not nearly enough for American workers. It would let the Treasury Department hand out hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations -- potentially including businesses owned by President Trump -- without requiring a binding commitment to preserve jobs and wages. And the bailouts could remain secret for six months.\n\nSenate Democrats, refusing to play along, blocked the bill in a procedural vote on Sunday night. But responsibility for the deadlock rests squarely on Mr. McConnell's shoulders.\n\nThe Federal Reserve unveiled a new set of needed programs to support the economy on Monday morning, expanding its \"whatever it takes\" crisis response. The operational independence of the central bank is once again proving its value, but Congress must resist the inclination to treat the Fed's actions as an alternative to fiscal policy. Instead, senators must emulate the Fed's urgency and authorize a set of supersize economic rescue programs.\n\nThere is a clear path forward. The proposal backed by Senate Republicans includes a number critical elements that enjoy broad support, including a $350 billion rescue fund for small business and a plan to send cash, totaling $250 billion, to most households.\n\nBut the urgency of the moment does not justify the egregious misuse of public resources.\n\nThe basic formula for helping businesses is straightforward. The federal government needs to provide the money that companies are unable to earn or borrow because of the pandemic. In exchange, companies need to maintain employment and wage payments. That's the necessary grand bargain -- the standard any bailout package should be required to meet.\n\nThe Republican bill would let small businesses borrow up to $10 million, and those loans would then be forgiven for any business that avoids cuts in jobs or wages. That's a fair deal.\n\nBut Republicans are proposing different rules for big businesses. Recipients of government bailouts would be required to avoid job or wage cuts only \"to the extent practicable\" -- a loophole so large it amounts to a lack of any meaningful obligation.\n\nThe bill, which creates a $500 billion bailout fund, would give the Treasury broad discretion to pick the recipients and to write the terms. The Treasury undoubtedly needs resources and flexibility to confront the crisis. But it would be unpardonable folly for Congress to grant too much latitude to an administration that has repeatedly proved itself to be a careless steward of public resources. To take just one example, the bill would let the Treasury bail out hotels owned by Mr. Trump on whatever terms his administration might care to dictate -- and Mr. Trump refused on Sunday night to pledge that he would refrain from taking any federal aid.\n\nSenate Democrats want more from Republicans in other areas, too. They are pushing to deliver more funding for health care, and for state and local governments, and to expand unemployment benefits. These are worthy goals that deserve bipartisan support. Bringing the spread of the coronavirus under control remains the single best way to limit damage to the economy, and health care providers and local governments are on the front lines and running low on money. The need extends beyond public health: The crisis threatens the viability of critical public services, including transit systems. And expanding benefits for unemployed workers would provide aid to those who need it most.\n\nIn each of these areas, however, the path to a compromise is straightforward, and something is clearly better than nothing. This is the third coronavirus bailout bill. There will be a fourth.\n\nBut what is the point of passing a bailout that does not protect jobs and wages?\n\nRepublicans can quickly resolve this standoff by accepting the necessary changes to protect the public interest. Alternatively, the Senate could table the big-business bailout. Boeing, the major airlines and other companies clamoring for help simply do not need federal assistance with the same urgency as small businesses and individual workers do -- particularly because the Fed in recent days has stepped in to help big companies borrow money.\n\nOr the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, could help Mr. McConnell do his job by passing a bill containing the necessary compromises and sending it to the Senate for approval.\n\nThe federal government is already lagging badly in its response to the coronavirus crisis. People are losing their jobs, and their businesses, with every passing day. It is time to act.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Hospital", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn several hours on Tuesday, Dr. Ashley Bray performed chest compressions at Elmhurst Hospital Center on a woman in her 80s, a man in his 60s and a 38-year-old who reminded the doctor of her fianc\u00e9. All had tested positive for the coronavirus and had gone into cardiac arrest. All eventually died.\n\nElmhurst, a 545-bed public hospital in Queens, has begun transferring patients not suffering from coronavirus to other facilities as it moves toward becoming a facility dedicated entirely to the outbreak. Doctors and nurses have struggled to make do with a few dozen ventilators. Calls over a loudspeaker of \"Team 700,\" the code for when a patient is on the verge of death, come several times a shift. Some have died inside the emergency room while waiting for a bed.\n\nA refrigerated truck has been stationed outside to hold the bodies of the dead. Over the past 24 hours, New York City's public hospital system said in a statement, 13 people at Elmhurst had died.\n\n\"It's apocalyptic,\" said Dr. Bray, a general medicine resident at the hospital.\n\nAcross the city, which has become the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, hospitals are beginning to confront the kind of harrowing surge in cases that has overwhelmed health care systems in China, Italy and other countries. On Wednesday morning, New York City reported 16,788 confirmed cases and 199 deaths.\n\nMore than 2,800 coronavirus patients have been hospitalized in the city. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday offered a glimmer of hope that social-distancing measures were starting to slow the growth in hospitalizations. Still, hospitals are preparing for a major influx.\n\nWorking with state and federal officials, hospitals have repeatedly expanded the portions of their facilities equipped to handle patients who had stayed home until worsening fevers and difficulty breathing forced them into emergency rooms.\n\nDr. Mitchell Katz, the head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which operates New York City's public hospitals, said plans were underway to transform many areas of the Elmhurst hospital into intensive care units for extremely sick patients.\n\nBut New York's hospitals may be about to lose their leeway for creativity in finding spaces.\n\nAll of the more than 1,800 intensive care units in New York City are expected to be full by Friday, according to a Federal Emergency Management Agency leadership briefing obtained by The New York Times. Patients could stay for weeks, limiting space for newly sickened residents. Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he had not seen the briefing; he said officials could quickly add intensive care beds if if the state dipped into its growing supply of ventilators, the machines that help the most sick coronavirus patients breathe.\n\nThe federal government is sending a 1,000-bed hospital ship to New York, although it is not scheduled to arrive until mid-April. Officials have begun erecting four 250-bed hospitals at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Midtown Manhattan, which could be ready in a week. President Trump said on Wednesday on Twitter that construction was ahead of schedule.\n\nOfficials have also discussed converting hotels and arenas into temporary medical facilities.\n\nAt least two city hospitals have filled up their morgues, and city officials anticipated that the rest would reach capacity by the end of this week, according to the leadership briefing. The city requested 85 refrigerated trailers from FEMA for mortuary services, along with staff, the briefing said.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Governor Cuomo said there were signs that density- control measures were working. Emergency services must now take patients to the closest hospital. The Tony Awards, scheduled for June 7, will be postponed. See more updates Updated 42m ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\n\"That is inaccurate,\" said a spokeswoman for the city's office of the chief medical examiner. \"We have significant morgue capacity in our five citywide sites, and the ability to expand.\"\n\nIn interviews, doctors and nurses at hospitals across the city gave accounts of how they were being stretched toward a breaking point.\n\nWorkers at several hospitals, including the Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, said employees such as obstetrician-gynecologists and radiologists have been called to work in emergency wards.\n\nAt a branch of the Montefiore Medical Center, also in the Bronx, there have been one or two deaths a day, or more, said Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, a nurse. There are not always enough gurneys, so some patients sit in chairs. One patient on Sunday had been without a bed for 36 hours, she said.\n\nConfirmed coronavirus patients are sometimes paired with those who have not yet received test results, added Ms. Sheridan-Gonzalez, the president of the New York State Nurses Association.\n\nAt the Mount Sinai Health System, one of the most prestigious health systems in the country, some hospital workers in Manhattan have posted photos on social media showing nurses using trash bags as protective gear. A system spokesman said she was not aware of nurses using trash bags.\n\nSince ventilators are in short supply, both Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian, two of the city's largest systems, are exploring using one machine to help multiple patients, an unusual move, according to employees at both networks and to staff emails.\n\nBut officials have called Elmhurst among the hardest-hit hospitals in the city.\n\n\"Definitely Elmhurst Hospital in Queens has had an extraordinary amount of activity,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a radio interview earlier this week. \"It's been very tough for Elmhurst.\"\n\nElmhurst Hospital Center opened in 1832 and moved to its current Queens location in 1957, making it one of the oldest hospitals in New York City. In the neighborhood it serves, Elmhurst, more than two-thirds of residents were born outside of the United States, the highest such rate in the city. It is a safety-net hospital, serving mainly low-income patients, including many who lack primary care doctors.\n\nMedical workers said they saw the first signs of the virus in early March -- an increase in patients coming in with flulike symptoms before the alarm had been fully raised in the city and the country. Tests results were taking longer then, but they eventually confirmed that many of these patients had coronavirus.\n\nIn the weeks after, the emergency room began filling up, with more than 200 people at times. Every chair in the waiting room was usually taken. Patients came in faster than the hospital could add beds; earlier this week, 60 coronavirus patients had been admitted but were still in the emergency room. One man waited almost 60 hours for a bed last week, a doctor said.\n\nThe patients coming in now are sicker than before because they were advised to try to recover at home, doctors said.\n\n\"Elmhurst is at the center of this crisis, and it's the number one priority of our public hospital system right now,\" the city's public hospital system's statement said. \"The front line staff are going above and beyond in this crisis, and we continue surging supplies and personnel to this critical facility to keep pace with the crisis.\"\n\nMr. Cuomo said that on Sunday, the state's projections showed hospitalizations doubling every two days, while Tuesday's estimates showed them doubling every 4.7 days. \"That is almost too good to be true,\" the governor said, \"but the theory is, given the density that we're dealing with, it spreads very quickly. But if you reduce the density, you can reduce the spread very quickly.\"\n\nBut the crowds outside of Elmhurst have not thinned out.\n\nThe line of people waiting outside of Elmhurst to be tested forms as early as 6 a.m., and some stay there until 5 p.m. Many are told to go home without being tested.\n\nJulio Jimenez, 35, spent six hours in line on Sunday night after running a fever while at work in a New Jersey warehouse. He returned on Monday morning in the pouring rain. On Tuesday, still coughing, eyes puffy, he stood in line for nearly seven hours and went home, untested, again.\n\n\"I don't know if I have the virus,\" Mr. Jimenez said. \"It's so hard. It's not just me. It's for many people. It's crazy.\"\n\nRikki Lane, a doctor who has worked at Elmhurst for more than 20 years, said the hospital had handled \"the first wave of this tsunami.\" She compared the scene in the emergency department with an overcrowded parking garage where physicians must move patients in and out of spots to access other patients blocked by stretchers.\n\nFamily members are not permitted inside, she said.\n\nDr. Lane recalled recently treating a man in his 30s whose breathing deteriorated quickly and had to be put on a ventilator. \"He was in distress and panicked, I could see the terror in his eyes,\" she said. \"He was alone.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Jesse McKinley, Jesse Drucker, Eileen Sullivan and Michael Schwirtz.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/coronavirus-ventilators-trump.html", "title": "After Considering $1 Billion Price Tag for Ventilators, White House Has Second Thoughts", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The White House had been preparing to reveal on Wednesday a joint venture between General Motors and Ventec Life Systems that would allow for the production of as many as 80,000 desperately needed ventilators to respond to an escalating pandemic when word suddenly came down that the announcement was off.\n\nThe decision to cancel the announcement, government officials say, came after the Federal Emergency Management Agency said it needed more time to assess whether the estimated cost was prohibitive. That price tag was more than $1 billion, with several hundred million dollars to be paid upfront to General Motors to retool a car parts plant in Kokomo, Ind., where the ventilators would be made with Ventec's technology.\n\nGovernment officials said that the deal might still happen but that they are examining at least a dozen other proposals. And they contend that an initial promise that the joint venture could turn out 20,000 ventilators in short order had shrunk to 7,500, with even that number in doubt. Longtime emergency managers at FEMA are working with military officials to sort through the competing offers and federal procurement rules while under pressure to give President Trump something to announce.\n\nBy early Thursday evening, at the coronavirus task force's regular news briefing, where the president often appears, there was still nothing to disclose, and the outcome of the deliberations remained unclear.\n\nBut a General Motors spokesman said that \"Project V,\" as the ventilator program is known, was moving very fast, and a company official said \"there's no issue with retooling.\"\n\nA Ventec representative agreed.\n\n\"Ventec and G.M. have been working at breakneck speed to leverage our collective expertise in ventilation and manufacturing to meet the needs of the country as quickly as possible and arm medical professionals with the number of ventilators needed to save lives,\" said Chris O. Brooks, Ventec's chief strategy officer.\n\nThe only thing missing was clarity from the government about how many ventilators they needed -- and who would be paid to build them.\n\nThe shortage of ventilators has emerged as one of the major criticisms of the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus. The need to quickly equip hospitals across the country with tens of thousands more of the devices to treat those most seriously ill with the virus was not anticipated despite the Trump administration's own projection in a simulation last year that millions of people could be hospitalized. And even now, the effort to produce them has been confused and disorganized.\n\nAt the center of the discussion about how to ramp up the production of ventilators is Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior White House aide, who has told people that he was called in two weeks ago by Vice President Mike Pence to produce more coronavirus test kits and who has now turned his attention to ventilators.\n\nHe has been directing officials at FEMA in the effort. Two officials said the suggestion to wait on the General Motors offer came from Col. Patrick Work, who is working at FEMA. Some government officials expressed concern about the possibility of ordering too many ventilators, leaving them with an expensive surplus.\n\nAs the agency has sorted through offers, trying to weigh production ability and costs, hospitals in New York and elsewhere are reporting a desperate need for more ventilators, which are critical in treating respiratory problems in a fast-rising tide of severe coronavirus cases.\n\nA spokeswoman for FEMA said Colonel Work presented information on each contract in such meetings but did not make any recommendations. A White House spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe involvement of General Motors was first floated this month as the carmaker's factory floor in Kokomo was grinding to a halt and workers were being sent home -- partly because the market was collapsing but also because workers would otherwise risk exposure to the coronavirus.\n\nLast week, General Motors, Ventec Life Systems and a coalition of business executives called StopTheSpread.org issued a statement saying that Ventec would \"leverage G.M.'s logistics, purchasing and manufacturing expertise to build more of their critically important ventilators,\" including some portable units.\n\nBy Sunday, Mr. Trump appeared to suggest on Twitter that a deal had been completed to mass-produce the ventilators, even though it was unclear who would pay to equip the General Motors plant or how long that process would take.\n\n\"Ford, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! @fema,\" he wrote. \"Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are?\"\n\nNot for the first time has Mr. Trump jumped the gun.\n\nTesla officials had in fact met with engineers from the medical device company Medtronic in a separate negotiation, but no partnership has yet been announced. And while the chief executive of General Motors, Mary T. Barra, was enthused about the ventilator idea, Mr. Trump's own aides had not embraced the G.M.-Ventec partnership -- in part because they had not seen the specifics of the proposal.\n\nAdministration officials said Thursday that they were struggling to understand just how many ventilators the new venture could make.\n\nThe initial projection, one senior administration official said, was that after three weeks of preparation it could produce an initial run of 20,000 ventilators, or about two-thirds of what Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York recently said his state alone needed to cover the influx of coronavirus patients expected in two weeks, if not sooner.\n\nThat number then shrank to 7,500 ventilators in the initial run, or maybe 5,000, an apparent recognition that auto transmissions and ventilators had very little in common. Those numbers are in flux and so are the Trump administration's because the White House cannot decide how many ventilators it wants.\n\nTargets have changed by the hour, officials said, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration, which approves the use of medical devices, and the White House try to figure out how many ventilators to request and how much they should cost.\n\nThose issues appeared to come to a head on Wednesday afternoon, when FEMA told the White House that it was premature to make a decision.\n\nThe $1.5 billion price tag comes to around $18,000 a ventilator. And the overall cost, by comparison, is roughly equal to buying 18 F-35s, the Pentagon's most advanced fighter jet.\n\nSo on Wednesday, despite the president's tweet three days earlier, FEMA was still weighing competing offers in order to make a recommendation to Mr. Kushner.

In the current crisis, we are all reaping what that movement has sown.\n\nAt least since the 19th century, when the proslavery theologian Robert Lewis Dabney attacked the physical sciences as \"theories of unbelief,\" hostility to science has characterized the more extreme forms of religious nationalism in the United States. Today, the hard core of climate deniers is concentrated among people who identify as religiously conservative Republicans. And some leaders of the Christian nationalist movement, like those allied with the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation, which has denounced environmental science as a \"Cult of the Green Dragon,\" cast environmentalism as an alternative -- and false -- theology.\n\nThis denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis. On March 15, Guillermo Maldonado, who calls himself an \"apostle\" and hosted Mr. Trump earlier this year at a campaign event at his Miami megachurch, urged his congregants to show up for worship services in person. \"Do you believe God would bring his people to his house to be contagious with the virus? Of course not,\" he said.\n\nRodney Howard-Browne of The River at Tampa Bay Church in Florida mocked people concerned about the disease as \"pansies\" and insisted he would only shutter the doors to his packed church \"when the rapture is taking place.\" In a sermon that was live-streamed on Facebook, Tony Spell, a pastor in Louisiana, said, \"We're also going to pass out anointed handkerchiefs to people who may have a fear, who may have a sickness and we believe that when those anointed handkerchiefs go, that healing virtue is going to go on them as well.\"\n\nBy all accounts, President Trump's tendency to trust his gut over the experts on issues like vaccines and climate change does not come from any deep-seated religious conviction. But he is perfectly in tune with the religious nationalists who form the core of his base. In his daily briefings from the White House, Mr. Trump actively disdains and contradicts the messages coming from his own experts and touts as yet unproven cures.\n\nNot every pastor is behaving recklessly, of course, and not every churchgoer in these uncertain times is showing up for services out of disregard for the scientific evidence. Far from it. Yet none of the benign uses of religion in this time of crisis have anything to do with Mr. Trump's expressed hope that the country would be \"opened up and just raring to go by Easter.\" He could, of course, have said, \"by mid-April.\" But Mr. Trump did not invoke Easter by accident, and many of his evangelical allies were pleased by his vision of \"packed churches all over our country.\"\n\n\"I think it would be a beautiful time,\" the president said.\n\nReligious nationalism has brought to American politics the conviction that our political differences are a battle between absolute evil and absolute good. When you're engaged in a struggle between the \"party of life\" and the \"party of death,\" as some religious nationalists now frame our political divisions, you don't need to worry about crafting careful policy based on expert opinion and analysis. Only a heroic leader, free from the scruples of political correctness, can save the righteous from the damned. Fealty to the cause is everything; fidelity to the facts means nothing. Perhaps this is why many Christian nationalist leaders greeted the news of the coronavirus as an insult to their chosen leader.\n\nIn an interview on March 13 on \"Fox & Friends,\" Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, called the response to Coronavirus \"hype\" and \"overreacting.\" \"You know, impeachment didn't work, and the Mueller report didn't work, and Article 25 didn't work, and so maybe now this is their next, ah, their next attempt to get Trump,\" he said.\n\nWhen Rev. Spell in Louisiana defied an order from Gov. John Bel Edwards and hosted in-person services for over 1,000 congregants, he asserted the ban was \"politically motivated.\" Figures like the anti-L.G.B.T. activist Steve Hotze added to the chorus, denouncing the concern as -- you guessed it -- \"fake news.\"\n\nOne of the first casualties of fact-free hyper-partisanship is competence in government. The incompetence of the Trump administration in grappling with this crisis is by now well known, at least among those who receive actual news. February 2020 will go down in history as the month in which the United States, in painful contrast with countries like South Korea and Germany, failed to develop the mass testing capability that might have saved many lives. Less well known is the contribution of the Christian nationalist movement in ensuring that our government is in the hands of people who appear to be incapable of running it well.\n\nConsider the case of Alex Azar, who as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has had a prominent role in mismanaging the crisis. It seems likely at this point that Mr. Azar's signature achievement will have been to rebrand his department as the \"Department of Life.\" Or maybe he will be remembered for establishing a division of Conscience and Religious Freedom, designed to permit health care providers to deny legal and often medically indicated health care services to certain patients as a matter of religious conscience.\n\nMr. Azar, a \"cabinet sponsor\" of Capitol Ministries, the Bible study group attended by multiple members of Mr. Trump's cabinet, brought with him to Health and Human Services an immovable conviction in the righteousness of the pharmaceutical industry (presumably formed during his five-year stint as an executive and lobbyist in the business), a willingness to speak in the most servile way about \"the courage\" and \"openness to change\" of Mr. Trump, and a commitment to anti-abortion politics, abstinence education and other causes of the religious right. What he did not bring, evidently, was any notable ability to manage a pandemic. Who would have guessed that a man skilled at praising Mr. Trump would not be the top choice for organizing the development of a virus testing program, the delivery of urgently needed protective gear to health care workers or a plan for augmenting hospital capabilities?\n\nOr consider Ben Carson, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and another \"cabinet sponsor\" of Capitol Ministries. As a former pediatric neurosurgeon, Mr. Carson brought more knowledge about medicine to his post than knowledge about housing issues. But that medical knowledge didn't stop him from asserting on March 8 that for the \"healthy individual\" thinking of attending one of Mr. Trump's then-ongoing large-scale campaign rallies, \"there's no reason that you shouldn't go.\"\n\nIt is fair to point out that the failings of the Trump administration in the current pandemic are at least as attributable to its economic ideology as they are to its religious inclinations. When the so-called private sector is supposed to have the answer to every problem, it's hard to deal effectively with the very public problem of a pandemic and its economic consequences. But if you examine the political roots of the life-threatening belief in the privatization of everything, you'll see that Christian nationalism played a major role in creating and promoting the economic foundations of America's incompetent response to the pandemic.\n\nFor decades, Christian nationalist leaders have lined up with the anti-government, anti-tax agenda not just as a matter of politics but also as a matter of theology. Ken Blackwell of the Family Research Council, one of the Christian right's major activist groups, has gone so far as to cast food stamps and other forms of government assistance for essential services as contrary to the \"biblical model.\" Limited government, according to this line of thinking, is \"godly government.\"\n\nWhen a strong centralized response is needed from the federal government, it doesn't help to have an administration that has never believed in a federal government serving the public good. Ordinarily, the consequences of this kind of behavior don't show up for some time. In the case of a pandemic, the consequences are too obvious to ignore.\n\nKatherine Stewart (@kathsstewart) is the author of \"The Power Worshippers: Inside the Dangerous Rise of Religious Nationalism.\"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Nurse Dies. Angry Co-Workers Blame a Lack of Protective Gear.", "body": "\"I'm okay. Don't tell Mom and Dad. They'll worry,\" he wrote to his sister. He may be the first nurse in New York City to die from the coronavirus.\n\nKious Kelly, a nurse manager at a Manhattan hospital, texted his sister on March 18 with some devastating news: He had tested positive for the coronavirus and was on a ventilator in the intensive care unit. He told her he could text but not talk.\n\n\"I'm okay. Don't tell Mom and Dad. They'll worry,\" he wrote to his sister, Marya Patrice Sherron.\n\nThat was his last message. Ms. Sherron's subsequent texts to him went unanswered. In less than a week, he was dead.\n\nMr. Kelly, a 48-year-old assistant nurse manager at Mount Sinai West, may have been the first New York City nurse to die from the virus.\n\nHis sister said he had asthma but was otherwise well.\n\n\"His death could have been prevented,\" Ms. Sherron said on Facebook Wednesday. Later, she added: \"I'm angry. He was healthy.\"\n\nColleagues at the hospital were angry, too. Some complained on social media channels that they did not have an adequate supply of protective clothing or masks.\n\nA nurse who worked with Mr. Kelly said the hospital had offered nurses one plastic protective gown for an entire shift, though normal protocol required a change of gowns between interactions with infected patients. The nurse, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the staff member was not authorized to speak to the media, said Mr. Kelly had not used protective equipment, even though he regularly helped nurses on his team with hands-on care.\n\nAs recently as March 10, he helped a nurse take off her protective gear after working with a patient who tested positive for the virus, the nurse said.\n\nSeveral Mount Sinai West staff members, contacted for this story, said they had been told by hospital administrators not to speak to journalists. Mr. Kelly's death was first reported in The New York Post.\n\nGia Lisa Krahne, an outside consultant who provided alternative Ayurvedic care to a patient at Mount Sinai West, said she last saw Mr. Kelly at work the week of March 9, interacting with patients and hospital staff, wearing neither a mask nor any protective gear.\n\nBevon Bloise, a registered nurse at Mount Sinai West, complained on Facebook that the hospital does not have sufficient personal protective equipment, or P.P.E. \"I'm also very angry with the Mount Sinai Health System for not protecting him. We do not have enough PPE, we do not have the correct PPE, and we do not have the appropriate staffing to handle this pandemic. And I do not appreciate representatives of this health system saying otherwise on the news.\"\n\n\"We lost a great fighter during this war,\" a co-worker named Diana Torres said on Facebook. She posted a photo of co-workers tying bandannas over their faces in an effort to protect themselves. \"NO THIS IS NOT PROPER PPE,\" she wrote.\n\nOn its Facebook page, Mount Sinai West said it was \"deeply saddened by the passing of a beloved member of our nursing staff,\" without naming Mr. Kelly.\n\nIn an email, a hospital spokeswoman, Lucia Lee, disputed the claim that the hospital had not furnished protective equipment to its staff. \"This crisis is straining the resources of all New York area hospitals, and while we do -- and have had -- enough protective equipment for our staff, we will all need more in the weeks ahead,\" Ms. Lee said in the statement.\n\nThe New York Post article included a photo of hospital staff wearing garbage bags over what appeared to be scrubs. Two nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being fired, said they were disposable scrubs made of permeable material, which is why nurses wrapped plastic garbage bags around them.\n\nThe photo, they said, was taken on March 17, at a time when there were many coronavirus patients at the hospital and others who had yet to be tested but who presented symptoms of infection.\n\nIn the emailed statement, Ms. Lee added that \"the troubling photo circulating in the media specifically shows the nurses in proper P.P.E. underneath garbage bags.\"\n\nShe did not respond to a question asking why hospital staff wore garbage bags.\n\nMr. Kelly lived a few blocks away from the hospital and was described by colleagues as a dedicated, good-humored colleague.\n\n\"He used to carry around a thick notepad holder that hides a box full of chocolates and candies so he can have it handy to give out to miserable/ grumbly nurses and doctors who are more likely than not 'hangry,'\" Joanne Loo, a nurse at Mount Sinai West, posted on Facebook on Wednesday.\n\nBut nursing was not his first vocation. A native of Lansing, Michigan, Mr. Kelly moved to New York more than 20 years ago to pursue a career as a dancer, his sister said. He then went to nursing school and worked as a nurse at Mount Sinai West, before being promoted to the post of assistant manager in the telemetry department.\n\nHis family is now trying to bring his body back to Michigan.\n\n\"We know we can't have a service anytime soon, but we want him home,\" Ms. Sherron said. \"He died alone. We want him home now.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "somini_sengupta@nytimes.com", "name": "Somini Sengupta", "type":

"Opinion | I Spent a Year in Space, and I Have Tips on Isolation to Share", "body": "Mr. Kelly is a retired NASA astronaut who spent nearly a year on the International Space Station.\n\nBeing stuck at home can be challenging. When I lived on the International Space Station for nearly a year, it wasn't easy. When I went to sleep, I was at work. When I woke up, I was still at work. Flying in space is probably the only job you absolutely cannot quit.\n\nBut I learned some things during my time up there that I'd like to share -- because they are about to come in handy again, as we all confine ourselves at home to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Here are a few tips on living in isolation, from someone who has been there.\n\nFollow a schedule\n\nOn the space station, my time was scheduled tightly, from the moment I woke up to when I went to sleep. Sometimes this involved a spacewalk that could last up to eight hours; other times, it involved a five-minute task, like checking on the experimental flowers I was growing in space. You will find maintaining a plan will help you and your family adjust to a different work and home life environment. When I returned to Earth, I missed the structure it provided and found it hard to live without.\n\nBut pace yourself\n\nWhen you are living and working in the same place for days on end, work can have a way of taking over everything if you let it. Living in space, I deliberately paced myself because I knew I was in it for the long haul -- just like we all are today. Take time for fun activities: I met up with crewmates for movie nights, complete with snacks, and binge-watched all of \"Game of Thrones\" -- twice.\n\nAnd don't forget to include in your schedule a consistent bedtime. NASA scientists closely study astronauts' sleep when we are in space, and they have found that quality of sleep relates to cognition, mood, and interpersonal relations -- all essential to getting through a mission in space or a quarantine at home.\n\nGo outside\n\nOne of the things I missed most while living in space was being able to go outside and experience nature. After being confined to a small space for months, I actually started to crave nature -- the color green, the smell of fresh dirt, and the feel of warm sun on my face. That flower experiment became more important to me than I could have ever imagined. My colleagues liked to play a recording of Earth sounds, like birds and rustling trees, and even mosquitoes, over and over. It brought me back to earth. (Although occasionally I found myself swatting my ears at the mosquitoes. )\n\nFor an astronaut, going outside is a dangerous undertaking that requires days of preparation, so I appreciate that in our current predicament, I can step outside any time I want for a walk or a hike -- no spacesuit needed. Research has shown that spending time in nature is beneficial for our mental and physical health, as is exercise. You don't need to work out two and a half hours a day, as astronauts on the space station do, but getting moving once a day should be part of your quarantine schedule (just stay at least six feet away from others).\n\nYou need a hobby\n\nWhen you are confined in a small space you need an outlet that isn't work or maintaining your environment.\n\nSome people are surprised to learn I brought books with me to space. The quiet and absorption you can find in a physical book -- one that doesn't ping you with notifications or tempt you to open a new tab -- is priceless. Many small bookstores are currently offering curbside pickup or home delivery service, which means you can support a local business while also cultivating some much-needed unplugged time.\n\nYou can also practice an instrument (I just bought a digital guitar trainer online), try a craft, or make some art. Astronauts take time for all of these while in space. (Remember Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield's famous cover of David Bowie's Space Oddity?)\n\nKeep a journal\n\nNASA has been studying the effects of isolation on humans for decades, and one surprising finding they have made is the value of keeping a journal. Throughout my yearlong mission, I took the time to write about my experiences almost every day. If you find yourself just chronicling the days' events (which, under the circumstances, might get repetitive) instead try describing what you are experiencing through your five senses or write about memories. Even if you don't wind up writing a book based on your journal like I did, writing about your days will help put your experiences in perspective and let you look back later on what this unique time in history has meant.\n\nTake time to connect\n\nEven with all the responsibilities of serving as commander of a space station, I never missed the chance to have a videoconference with family and friends. Scientists have found that isolation is damaging not only to our mental health, but to our physical health as well, especially our immune systems. Technology makes it easier than ever to keep in touch, so it's worth making time to connect with someone every day -- it might actually help you fight off viruses.\n\nListen to experts\n\nI've found that most problems aren't rocket science, but when they are rocket science, you should ask a rocket scientist. Living in space taught me a lot about the importance of trusting the advice of people who knew more than I did about their subjects, whether it was science, engineering, medicine, or the design of the incredibly complex space station that was keeping me alive.\n\nEspecially in a challenging moment like the one we are living through now, we have to seek out knowledge from those who know the most about it and listen to them. Social media and other poorly vetted sources can be transmitters of misinformation just as handshakes transmit viruses, so we have to make a point of seeking out reputable sources of facts, like the World Health Organization and the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.\n\nWe are all connected\n\nSeen from space, the Earth has no borders. The spread of the coronavirus is showing us that what we share is much more powerful than what keeps us apart, for better or for worse. All people are inescapably interconnected, and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will all be.\n\nOne of the side effects of seeing Earth from the perspective of space, at least for me, is feeling more compassion for others. As helpless as we may feel stuck inside our homes, there are always things we can do -- I've seen people reading to children via videoconference, donating their time and dollars to charities online, and running errands for elderly or immuno-compromised neighbors. The benefits for the volunteer are just as great as for those helped.\n\nI've seen humans work together to prevail over some of the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one if we all do our part and work together as a team.\n\nOh, and wash your hands -- often.\n\nScott Kelly is a retired NASA astronaut who spent nearly a year on the International Space Station.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

change to tax policy could hand $170 billion in tax savings to real estate tycoons.\n\nThe federal government's planned $2 trillion economic rescue package includes financial aid for individuals and industries that are struggling to survive the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIt also includes a potential bonanza for America's richest real estate investors.\n\nSenate Republicans inserted an easy-to-overlook provision on page 203 of the 880-page bill that would permit wealthy investors to use losses generated by real estate to minimize their taxes on profits from things like investments in the stock market. The estimated cost of the change over 10 years is $170 billion.\n\nUnder the existing tax code, when real estate investors generate losses from gradually writing down the value of their properties, a process known as depreciation, they can use some of those losses to offset other taxes. The result is that people can enjoy big tax breaks stemming from only-on-paper losses, even if they enjoy big cash profits in the real world.\n\nBut the use of those losses was limited by the 2017 tax-cut package. The losses could be used only to shelter the first $500,000 of a married couple's nonbusiness income, such as capital gains from investments. Any leftover losses got rolled over to future years.\n\nThe new stimulus bill lifts that restriction for three years -- this year, and two retroactive years -- a boon for couples with more than $500,000 in annual capital gains or income from sources other than their business. That group comprises the top 1 percent of taxpayers, according to Internal Revenue Service data.\n\nA draft congressional analysis this week found that the change is the second-biggest tax giveaway in the $2 trillion stimulus package. That cost analysis also includes the impact of some smaller technical changes to the law. Other industries, like oil and gas and commodities trading, also stand to benefit from the change.\n\n\"It's a pretty big deal,\" said Peter Buell, who runs tax services for the real estate practice of the accounting firm Marcum. A separate provision in the stimulus bill, which removes restrictions on losses that people can carry over from previous years, would make the tax break even more lucrative.\n\nA spokesman for the Real Estate Roundtable, a lobbying group, played down the importance of the provision. He said that under the 2017 law, some real estate developers simply spread their losses over multiple years, potentially avoiding the $500,000 ceiling.\n\nAmong the possible beneficiaries of the change are real estate investors in President Trump's inner circle.\n\nIn 2018, The New York Times reported that Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and adviser, likely didn't pay federal income taxes for several years because of paper losses generated by depreciating his companies' properties, despite his significant wealth and earnings from other sources, according to confidential financial documents.\n\nMr. Trump has also reported significant losses on his tax return. Portions of a 1995 tax return published by The Times showed nearly $916 million in losses, which could have permitted him to avoid paying any federal income taxes for almost two decades.\n\nThe 2017 law restricted both men's abilities to reap tax savings through only-on-paper losses; now, with those limits likely to be lifted, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner, as well as other wealthy real estate developers, have the potential to score big tax savings.\n\nThe Senate unanimously approved the $2 trillion aid package late Wednesday night. The House is expected to vote on the measure on Friday to deal with the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic; it would be the largest fiscal stimulus package in modern American history. It would then be sent to Mr. Trump for his signature.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_drucker@nytimes.com", "name":

"Hahnemann University Hospital could hold 500 patients with the coronavirus. But city officials said they could not pay the nearly $1 million a month the owner has requested.\n\nA hospital with room for nearly 500 beds has been closed for months in the center of Philadelphia, a city bracing for the spread of the coronavirus and a crush of sick patients.\n\nBut the facility will remain empty, city officials said, because they cannot accept the owner's offer: buy the hospital or lease it for almost $1 million a month, including utilities and other costs.\n\n\"We don't have the need to own it nor the resources to buy it. So we are done and we are moving on,\" Mayor Jim Kenney told reporters on Thursday during the city's daily briefing.\n\nThe next day, he said that Temple University would let the city use a music and sports venue for free. The city would no longer pursue the closed facility, Hahnemann University Hospital.\n\nThe abrupt end of the dispute underscored the frantic search for more hospital beds as cities try to prepare for a crisis that is overwhelming medical facilities in New York, and highlighted the tensions between government officials and businesses in responding to the pandemic. This week, the Trump administration backed away from announcing a $1 billion deal with General Motors and Ventec Life Systems to produce ventilators, after officials said they needed more time to assess the estimated cost.\n\nIn Philadelphia, coronavirus infections are quickly rising. On Friday, the city health commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley, reported 154 new cases, for a total of 637 cases across every ZIP code of the city, and three deaths. \"This virus is everywhere in Philadelphia,\" he said.\n\nThe owner of the hospital, Joel Freedman of Broad Street Healthcare Properties, a real estate company, said he had offered to sell the facility to the city well below market price, or to lease it for $60 a bed a month, far less than what two other hospitals in California agreed to charge to lease their facilities.\n\n\"Anyone looking at the apples to apples comparison can see that Mr. Freedman not only desired to be helpful to the city of Philadelphia and its leaders, but he was very reasonable,\" said Sam Singer, a spokesman for Mr. Freedman, who is based in Los Angeles. \"We're disappointed that they didn't accept what we offered, but we stand ready to be helpful to the city or the state if they want to reopen discussions.\"\n\nHahnemann Hospital, which once served the city's poorest patients, closed in September 2019. The hospital had been suffering millions of dollars in losses a month, Mr. Freedman told The Philadelphia Business Journal last June.\n\n\"We relentlessly pursued numerous strategic options to keep Hahnemann in operation, and have been uncompromising in our commitment to our staff, patients and community,\" Mr. Freedman said at the time. \"We are faced with the heartbreaking reality that Hahnemann cannot continue to lose millions of dollars each month and remain in business.\"\n\nThe decision to close the hospital last year infuriated local leaders and led Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent running to be the Democratic nominee for president, to hold a rally outside the hospital. He described the closure as a consequence of greed, and an example of the need for a better health care system.\n\nMr. Singer said Mr. Freedman had been unfairly maligned throughout the recent dispute, and that his obligations included maintenance, compensating his staff and paying off the loan he took out to buy the property.\n\n\"They've wrongly been critical of Mr. Freedman,\" Mr. Singer said of his detractors. \"We understand that emotions are high. We don't want in any way to hold that against them.\"\n\nHe added, \"Even with those harsh words, our doors, our ears, our minds are still open. We want to help.\"\n\nSince last fall, the hospital has sat empty and fallen into disrepair, Mayor Kenney said on Thursday. \"It has no beds and would require extensive work to make it usable again,\" he said.\n\nMr. Kenney said the city had offered to lease the hospital for a \"nominal\" amount and pay for its maintenance and expenses, a deal that would have meant \"hundreds of thousands of dollars a month\" for Mr. Freedman and made the property more marketable in the future.\n\n\"Yet the owner would not agree to our offer,\" he said\n\nInstead, Mr. Freedman wanted the city to pay $400,000 a month in rent in addition to making improvements and paying for other expenses, Mr. Kenney said. \"I'll let others decide whether that's reasonable or not,\" Mr. Kenney said.\n\nMr. Singer said the city contacted Mr. Freedman around March 11 about leasing the property. \"We responded immediately and said, 'Yes, we would like to help in any manner,'\" he said.\n\nMr. Freedman offered to sell the property below market price or lease it for $27 a bed a month. The city would have to pay an additional $33 a bed a month to cover the costs of utilities and taxes, he said. The full amount came to about $910,000 a month, Mr. Singer said.\n\n\"They just decided, 'We're not going to pursue Hahnemann,'\" he said.\n\nCity officials had signaled that negotiations were breaking down earlier this week. On Tuesday, the city's managing director, Brian Abernathy, told reporters that what Mr. Freedman wanted was \"unreasonable.\"\n\n\"I think he's looking at this as a business transaction rather than providing an imminent and important aid to the city and our residents,\" Mr. Abernathy said.\n\nCity Councilor Helen Gym said on Twitter that day that Philadelphia should not let \"unconscionable greed to get in the way of saving lives,\" and called for acquiring the property through eminent domain. Mr. Kenny said city officials had explored that option but determined it was too time-consuming and would require them to purchase the building at market price.\n\nMr. Kenney said in a news conference Friday that the city would use the Liacouras Center, a concert and sports venue at Temple University, for additional hospital space. The university will let the center be used for free and the space can fit up to 250 beds, officials said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday announced a sweeping relaxation of environmental rules in response to the coronavirus pandemic, allowing power plants, factories and other facilities to determine for themselves if they are able to meet legal requirements on reporting air and water pollution.\n\nThe move comes amid an influx of requests from businesses for a relaxation of regulations as they face layoffs, personnel restrictions and other problems related to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIssued by the E.P.A.'s top compliance official, Susan P. Bodine, the policy sets new guidelines for companies to monitor themselves for an undetermined period of time during the outbreak and says that the agency will not issue fines for violations of certain air, water and hazardous-waste-reporting requirements.\n\nCompanies are normally required to report when their factories discharge certain levels of pollution into the air or water.\n\n\"In general, the E.P.A. does not expect to seek penalties for violations of routine compliance monitoring, integrity testing, sampling, laboratory analysis, training, and reporting or certification obligations in situations where the E.P.A. agrees that Covid-19 was the cause of the noncompliance and the entity provides supporting documentation to the E.P.A. upon request,\" the order states.\n\nIt said the agency's focus during the outbreak would be \"on situations that may create an acute risk or imminent threat to public health or the environment\" and said it would exercise \"discretion\" in enforcing other environmental rules.\n\nThe order asks companies to \"act responsibly\" if they cannot currently comply with rules that require them to monitor or report the release of hazardous air pollution. Businesses, it said, should \"minimize the effects and duration of any noncompliance\" and keep records to report to the agency how Covid-19 restrictions prevented them from meeting pollution rules.\n\n\"E.P.A. is committed to protecting human health and the environment, but recognizes challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from Covid-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements,\" Andrew R. Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement.\n\nEnvironmental groups and former Obama administration officials described the policy as an unprecedented relaxation of rules for petrochemical plants and other major polluters.\n\nGina McCarthy, who led the E.P.A. under the Obama administration and now serves as president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called it \"an open license to pollute.\" She said that while individual companies might need flexibility, \"this brazen directive is nothing short of an abject abdication of the E.P.A. mission to protect our well being.''\n\nCynthia Giles, who headed the E.P.A. enforcement division during the Obama administration, said: \"This is essentially a nationwide waiver of environmental rules. It is so far beyond any reasonable response I am just stunned.\"\n\nOther observers defended the move. Granta Nakayama, a partner at the law firm King & Spalding who served in the E.P.A.'s office of compliance under President George W. Bush, said the memo did not give companies a free pass to pollute, but rather provided guidance in a challenging situation where many industries are facing unique circumstances.\n\n\"It's a very straightforward and sensible, in my view, guidance,\" he said.\n\nAgency officials said the new policy relaxes compliance for monitoring and reporting only so that facilities can concentrate on ensuring that their pollution-control equipment remains safe and operational.\n\n\"It is not a nationwide waiver of environmental rules,\" said Andrea Woods, an E.P.A. spokeswoman. \"For situations outside of routine monitoring and reporting, the agency has reserved its authorities and will take the pandemic into account on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nThe memo said the compliance changes were retroactive to March 13.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_friedman@nytimes.com", "name": "Lisa Friedman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanctions (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_R._Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew R.

The Mission Failed.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThirteen years ago, a group of U.S. public health officials came up with a plan to address what they regarded as one of the medical system's crucial vulnerabilities: a shortage of ventilators.\n\nThe breathing-assistance machines tended to be bulky, expensive and limited in number. The plan was to build a large fleet of inexpensive portable devices to deploy in a flu pandemic or another crisis.\n\nMoney was budgeted. A federal contract was signed. Work got underway.\n\nAnd then things suddenly veered off course. A multibillion-dollar maker of medical devices bought the small California company that had been hired to design the new machines. The project ultimately produced zero ventilators.\n\nThat failure delayed the development of an affordable ventilator by at least half a decade, depriving hospitals, states and the federal government of the ability to stock up. The federal government started over with another company in 2014, whose ventilator was approved only last year and whose products have not yet been delivered.\n\nToday, with the coronavirus ravaging America's health care system, the nation's emergency-response stockpile is still waiting on its first shipment. The scarcity of ventilators has become an emergency, forcing doctors to make life-or-death decisions about who gets to breathe and who does not.\n\nThe stalled efforts to create a new class of cheap, easy-to-use ventilators highlight the perils of outsourcing projects with critical public-health implications to private companies; their focus on maximizing profits is not always consistent with the government's goal of preparing for a future crisis.\n\n\"We definitely saw the problem,\" said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who ran the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017. \"We innovated to try and get a solution. We made really good progress, but it doesn't appear to have resulted in the volume that we needed.\"\n\nThe project -- code-named Aura -- came in the wake of a parade of near-miss pandemics: SARS, MERS, bird flu and swine flu.\n\nFederal officials decided to re-evaluate their strategy for the next public health emergency. They considered vaccines, antiviral drugs, protective gear and ventilators, the last line of defense for patients suffering respiratory failure. The federal government's Strategic National Stockpile had full-service ventilators in its warehouses, but not in the quantities that would be needed to combat a major pandemic.\n\nLatest Updates: Markets and Business Despite a bailout, airline executives offer a bleak outlook. Wall Street falls back after three-day surge. Drop in consumer sentiment reading shows early look at the economic collapse. See more updates Updated 32h ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nIn 2006, the Department of Health and Human Services established a new division, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, with a mandate to prepare medical responses to chemical, biological and nuclear attacks, as well as infectious diseases.\n\nIn its first year in operation, the research agency considered how to expand the number of ventilators. It estimated that an additional 70,000 machines would be required in a moderate influenza pandemic.\n\nThe ventilators in the national stockpile were not ideal. In addition to being big and expensive, they required a lot of training to use. The research agency convened a panel of experts in November 2007 to devise a set of requirements for a new generation of mobile, easy-to-use ventilators.\n\nIn 2008, the government requested proposals from companies that were interested in designing and building the ventilators.\n\nThe goal was for the machines to be approved by regulators for mass development by 2010 or 2011, according to budget documents that the Department of Health and Human Services submitted to Congress in 2008. After that, the government would buy as many as 40,000 new ventilators and add them to the national stockpile.\n\nThe ventilators were to cost less than $3,000 each. The lower the price, the more machines the government would be able to buy.\n\nCompanies submitted bids for the Project Aura job. The research agency opted not to go with a large, established device maker. Instead it chose Newport Medical Instruments, a small outfit in Costa Mesa, Calif.\n\nNewport, which was owned by a Japanese medical device company, only made ventilators. Being a small, nimble company, Newport executives said, would help it efficiently fulfill the government's needs.\n\nVentilators at the time typically went for about $10,000 each, and getting the price down to $3,000 would be tough. But Newport's executives bet they would be able to make up for any losses by selling the ventilators around the world.\n\n\"It would be very prestigious to be recognized as a supplier to the federal government,\" said Richard Crawford, who was Newport's head of research and development at the time. \"We thought the international market would be strong, and there is where Newport would have a good profit on the product.\"\n\nFederal officials were pleased. In addition to replenishing the national stockpile, \"we also thought they'd be so attractive that the commercial market would want to buy them, too,\" said Nicole Lurie, who was then the assistant secretary for preparedness and response inside the Department of Health and Human Services. With luck, the new generation of ventilators would become ubiquitous, helping hospitals nationwide better prepare for a crisis.\n\nThe contract was officially awarded a few months after the H1N1 outbreak, which the C.D.C. estimated infected 60 million and killed 12,000 in the United States, began to taper off in 2010. The contract called for Newport to receive $6.1 million upfront, with the expectation that the government would pay millions more as it bought thousands of machines to fortify the stockpile.\n\nProject Aura was Newport's first job for the federal government. Things moved quickly and smoothly, employees and federal officials said in interviews.\n\nEvery three months, officials with the biomedical research agency would visit Newport's headquarters. Mr. Crawford submitted monthly reports detailing the company's spending and progress.\n\nThe federal officials \"would check everything,\" he said. \"If we said we were buying equipment, they would want to know what it was used for. There were scheduled visits, scheduled requirements and deliverables each month.\"\n\nIn 2011, Newport shipped three working prototypes from the company's California plant to Washington for federal officials to review.\n\nDr. Frieden, who ran the C.D.C. at the time, got a demonstration in a small conference room attached to his office. \"I got all excited,\" he said. \"It was a multiyear effort that had resulted in something that was going to be really useful.\"\n\nIn April 2012, a senior Health and Human Services official testified before Congress that the program was \"on schedule to file for market approval in September 2013.\" After that, the machines would go into production.\n\nThen everything changed.\n\nThe medical device industry was undergoing rapid consolidation, with one company after another merging with or acquiring other makers. Manufacturers wanted to pitch themselves as one-stop shops for hospitals, which were getting bigger, and that meant offering a broader suite of products. In May 2012, Covidien, a large medical device manufacturer, agreed to buy Newport for just over $100 million.\n\nCovidien -- a publicly traded company with sales of $12 billion that year -- already sold traditional ventilators, but that was only a small part of its multifaceted businesses. In 2012 alone, Covidien bought five other medical device companies, in addition to Newport.\n\nNewport executives and government officials working on the ventilator contract said they immediately noticed a change when Covidien took over. Developing inexpensive portable ventilators no longer seemed like a top priority.\n\nNewport applied in June 2012 for clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market the device, but two former federal officials said Covidien had demanded additional funding and a higher sales price for the ventilators. The government gave the company an additional $1.4 million, a drop in the bucket for a company Covidien's size.\n\nGovernment officials and executives at rival ventilator companies said they suspected that Covidien had acquired Newport to prevent it from building a cheaper product that would undermine Covidien's profits from its existing ventilator business.\n\nSome Newport executives who worked on the project were reassigned to other roles. Others decided to leave the company.\n\n\"Up until the time the company sold, I was really happy and excited about the project,\" said Hong-Lin Du, Newport's president at the time of its sale. \"Then I was assigned to a different job.\"\n\nIn 2014, with no ventilators having been delivered to the government, Covidien executives told officials at the biomedical research agency that they wanted to get out of the contract, according to three former federal officials. The executives complained that it was not sufficiently profitable for the company.\n\nThe government agreed to cancel the contract. The world was focused at the time on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The research agency started over, awarding a new contract for $13.8 million to the giant Dutch company Philips. In 2015, Covidien was sold for $50 billion to another huge medical device company, Medtronic. Charles J. Dockendorff, Covidien's former chief financial officer, said he did not know why the contract had fell apart. \"I am not aware of that issue,\" he said in a text message.\n\nRobert J. White, president of the minimally invasive therapies group at Medtronic who worked at Covidien during the Newport acquisition, initially said he had no recollection of the Project Aura contract. A Medtronic spokeswoman later said that Mr. White was under the impression that the contract had been winding down before Covidien bought Newport.\n\nIt wasn't until last July that the F.D.A. signed off on the new Philips ventilator, the Trilogy Evo. The government ordered 10,000 units in December, setting a delivery date in mid-2020.\n\nAs the extent of the spread of the new coronavirus in the United States became clear, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, revealed on March 15 that the stockpile had 12,700 ventilators ready to deploy. The government has since sped up maintenance to increase the number available to 16,660 -- still fewer than a quarter of what officials years earlier had estimated would be required in a moderate flu pandemic.\n\nLast week, the Health and Human Services Department contacted ventilator makers to see how soon they could produce thousands of machines. And it began pressing Philips to speed up its planned shipments.\n\nThe stockpile is \"still awaiting delivery of the Trilogy Evo,\" a Health and Human Services spokeswoman said. \"We do not currently have any in inventory, though we are expecting them soon.\"\n\nKitty Bennett contributed research.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

It is separate from the newsroom.\n\nFor a few hours on Wednesday, it seemed the Senate finally had mustered the will to start pumping trillions of desperately needed dollars into the American economy.\n\nThen four Republican senators -- Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Tim Scott of South Carolina and Rick Scott of Florida -- announced they had found a flaw in the economic stimulus legislation so grave that they would be forced to delay its passage.\n\nThe proposed unemployment benefits, they said, were much too generous.\n\nYes, that's right: They worried the federal government was in danger of doing too much to help low-income workers whose jobs are being sacrificed to save lives.\n\nThe views expressed by the four senators are not just meanspirited but misguided, for reasons we will explain below. Yet the senators' timing is even worse. The United States has never experienced a comparable collapse in economic activity. Thousands upon thousands of workers are losing their livelihoods with every passing day that Congress continues to drag its feet. How can it be that any senator does not grasp the urgency of this moment in American history? How can it be that any senator would threaten further delays to prevent a few thousand workers from getting a few hundred dollars in extra aid?\n\nThe clear and present danger is in doing too little, not in doing too much.\n\nThe bailout bill is, without doubt, highly imperfect.\n\nThe restrictions on companies that receive federal assistance are insufficient and, in many cases, amount to guidelines for the Treasury Department to impose at its discretion rather than binding requirements. The $367 billion provided for small businesses is less than a third of what some experts estimate is needed to stave off a wave of layoffs and bankruptcies.\n\nThe funding for state and local governments, which are marshaling most of the resources to confront the pandemic, is even more inadequate. The state of Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine proposed $14 billion in budget cuts on Wednesday, would get just $2.1 billion in federal aid. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo blasted the bill as \"really terrible\" and described the $3.1 billion earmarked for his state as \"a drop in the bucket.\" His aides said the state already has spent at least $1 billion to fight the pandemic and to care for people who are sick -- and the crisis has not crested yet. Washington, D.C. has a larger population than Wyoming -- and more than four times as many confirmed coronavirus cases -- but it is slated to receive significantly less federal funding.\n\nAnd the bill is packed to the gills with unwarranted gifts for undeserving recipients, including $17 billion to bail out Boeing, a company that lately has charted new frontiers in corporate mismanagement. (It is worth noting that the senators moralizing about welfare benefits made no objection to bailing out companies that had failed to manage their business prudently.) The Times also reported Wednesday that a provision in the bill could allow President Trump's hotels to qualify for bailout funds otherwise intended for small businesses.\n\nBut these flaws are no reason to hesitate. The bill, on balance, would do far more good than harm. And while it does not do enough, it is only the third coronavirus bailout bill. It is clear already that Congress will need to keep writing checks.\n\nMr. Graham, Mr. Sasse and Messrs Scott see problems in the part of the bill that expands unemployment benefits. Benefits in normal times are calculated as a percentage of lost salary, typically around 45 percent, up to a maximum amount that varies by state. The national average is $385 a week, which isn't enough to keep a family above the poverty line.\n\nThe legislation would add a fixed sum of $600 to those weekly payments for the next four months. As a result, some low-wage workers who lose their jobs would get more than their former salaries -- \"more by not working than by working,\" three of the senators said in a joint statement.\n\nThey argued that this would encourage companies to fire workers, or that it would encourage workers to stop working, or that it would discourage people from seeking work. Or maybe all three. The consistency in their explanations was mostly in the subtext of indignation.\n\nThe concerns don't add up. People who quit jobs typically are ineligible for unemployment benefits. Under the legislation, workers who quit because of the coronavirus would qualify for benefits, but those are not people who are leaving because they want a little more money. They are leaving -- often as a consequence of state and local decisions to shut down commerce -- to limit the danger to themselves, and perhaps to others as well.\n\nThere is wide agreement among economists that unemployment benefits reduce the incentive to return to work. That's why states replace only a portion of lost wages in normal times. But at the moment, staying home is exactly what's needed to prevent the spread of the virus. And paying people who have lost jobs is what's needed to limit the economic damage. And the extra benefits last four months. It's an emergency stipend, not a retirement program.\n\nIn this hour of crisis, those at the bottom of the economic pyramid are in the greatest need of help. There is no warrant for delay, and still less for shortchanging workers of a few hundred dollars in a bill that will shovel trillions of dollars into the American economy.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nDez-Ann Romain, principal of the Brooklyn Democracy Academy, a public high school, always kept her office neat and freshened with new flowers, and kept the school decorated with inspirational quotes.\n\n\"She was one of the most innovative school leaders I've ever worked with -- her students just adored her,\" said Courtney Winkfield, a New York City schools official who mentored Ms. Romain.\n\nMs. Romain died Monday from complications of the coronavirus -- the first known death of a New York City public school staff member from the virus.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there were 15,597 confirmed coronavirus cases in New York City, with 192 deaths connected to the disease.\n\nWhile the authorities warn that there will be many more fatalities from the virus, Ms. Romain's struck a chord -- the early death of a prominent New Yorker who has touched many people's lives.\n\nRonda Phillips, 48, the principal at Kappa V High School, which uses the same building as the academy, is also hospitalized, school officials said.\n\nMs. Romain's death drove home what the authorities have been warning all along, that the virus does not just kill the old and medically frail. As of now, only five people under the age of 45 in New York City have died from the virus.\n\n\"She was a healthy, vibrant, energetic 36-year-old woman who had one of the toughest jobs anybody could have, and she did it with resilience,\" Ms. Winkfield said.\n\nSchools Chancellor Richard Carranza sent a letter to the academy community on Monday night notifying them of Ms. Romain's death.\n\nIn a statement, Chancellor Carranza called Ms. Romain's death \"painful for all of us\" and offered condolences to the academy community and to Ms. Romain's family.\n\nMs. Romain was in her fourth year leading the academy, a transfer school for students who were challenged by traditional high schools.\n\nSchool officials said that she last reported to school on March 12, after which the school was deep-cleaned and disinfected on a daily basis.\n\nShe had begun to feel ill and was hospitalized on March 18 for pneumonia, school officials said. A day later, the academy notified its community that there was a self-reported Covid-19 case in the school, officials said.\n\nMark Treyger, a Brooklyn city councilman who chairs the council's education committee, called Ms. Romain's death devastating and said Mayor Bill de Blasio had placed students, teachers and the staff at risk by failing to close schools more quickly as the virus began spreading in the city. Mr. Treyger also faulted city officials for failing to require principals to inform their communities of positive cases in individual schools.\n\n\"By failing to disclose virus cases in schools, they kept families in the dark and left more lives at risk,\" Mr. Treyger said.\n\nJane Meyer, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, called Mr. Treyger's claim \"absolutely false\" and said \"the health and safety of our students and staff have been the sole driver of every decision made by the mayor and chancellor.\"\n\nMiranda Barbot, a Department of Education spokeswoman, said the department was directed to close schools when the city's health department confirmed a case \"and we immediately did that for the one confirmation we received while school was still in session.\"\n\n\"The city has been at community transmission for over a week, and it's impossible to trace the source of exposure,\" she said. \"But as of March 13, the city's health department advised that a positive case in the school or workplace environment did not put others at higher risk than did anywhere else in the city.\"\n\n\"Regardless, we have been deep cleaning buildings daily,\" she added, \"and supporting

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/business/trump-coronavirus-economy.html", "title": "Trump Considers Reopening Economy, Over Health Experts' Objections", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- As the United States entered Week 2 of trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus by shuttering large swaths of the economy, President Trump, Wall Street executives and many conservative economists began questioning whether the government had gone too far and should instead lift restrictions that are already inflicting deep pain on workers and businesses.\n\nConsensus continues to grow among government leaders and health officials that the best way to defeat the virus is to order nonessential businesses to close and residents to confine themselves at home. Britain, after initially resisting such measures, essentially locked down its economy on Monday, as did the governors of Virginia, Michigan and Oregon. More than 100 million Americans will soon be subject to stay-at-home orders.\n\nRelaxing those restrictions could significantly increase the death toll from the virus, public health officials warn. Many economists say there is no positive trade-off -- resuming normal activity prematurely would only strain hospitals and result in even more deaths, while exacerbating a recession that has most likely already arrived.\n\nThe economic shutdown is causing damage that is only beginning to appear in official data. Morgan Stanley researchers said on Monday that they now expected the economy to shrink by an annualized rate of 30 percent in the second quarter of this year, and the unemployment rate to jump to nearly 13 percent. Both would be records, in modern economic statistics.\n\nOfficials have said the federal government's initial 15-day period for social distancing is vital to slowing the spread of the virus, which has already infected more than 40,000 people in the United States. But Mr. Trump and a chorus of conservative voices have begun to suggest that the shock to the economy could hurt the country more than deaths from the virus.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump said his administration would reassess whether to keep the economy shuttered after the initial 15-day period ends next Monday, saying it could extend another week and that certain parts of the country could reopen sooner than others, depending on the extent of infections.\n\n\"Our country wasn't built to be shut down,\" Mr. Trump said during a briefing at the White House. \"America will, again, and soon, be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. Lot sooner. We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.\"\n\nSimilar views are emanating from parts of corporate America, where companies are struggling with a shutdown that has emptied hotels, airplanes, malls and restaurants and sent the stock market tumbling so fast that automatic circuit breakers to halt trading have been tripped repeatedly. Stocks have collapsed about 34 percent since the coronavirus spread globally -- the steepest plunge in decades -- erasing three years of gains under Mr. Trump.\n\nLloyd Blankfein, the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, wrote on Twitter that \"crushing the economy\" had downsides and suggested that \"within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.\"\n\nEven Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, whose state has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, has begun publicly floating the notion that, at some point, states will need to restart economic activity and debating how that should unfold.\n\nLatest Updates: Markets and Business Global markets rise on optimism of a strong U.S. response. Report shows economic activity plummeting in Europe. Toyota suspends some production, citing lowered demand. See more updates More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\n\"You can't stop the economy forever,\" Mr. Cuomo said in a news conference on Monday. \"So we have to start to think about does everyone stay out of work? Should young people go back to work sooner? Can we test for those who had the virus, resolved, and are now immune and can they start to go back to work?\"\n\nAny push to loosen the new limits on commerce and movement would contradict the consensus advice of public health officials, risking a surge in infections and deaths from the virus. Many economists warn that abruptly reopening the economy could backfire, overwhelming an already stressed health care system, sowing uncertainty among consumers, and ultimately dealing deeper, longer-lasting damage to growth.\n\nThe recent rise of cases in Hong Kong, after there had been an easing of the spread of the virus, is something of an object lesson about how ending strict measures too soon can have dangerous consequences. Yet places like China, which took the idea of lockdown to the extreme, have managed to flatten the curve.\n\n\"You can't call off the best weapon we have, which is social isolation, even out of economic desperation, unless you're willing to be responsible for a mountain of deaths,\" said Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"Thirty days makes more sense than 15 days. Can't we try to put people's lives first for at least a month?\"\n\nFor the last four days, some White House officials, including those working for Vice President Mike Pence, who leads the coronavirus task force, have been raising questions about when the government should start easing restrictions.\n\nAmong the options being discussed are narrowing restrictions on economic activity to target specific age groups or locations, as well as increasing the numbers of people who can be together in groups, said one official, who cautioned that the discussions were preliminary.\n\nHealth officials inside the administration have mostly opposed that idea, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, an infectious diseases expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, who has said in interviews that he believes it will be \"at least\" several more weeks until people can start going about their lives in a more normal fashion.\n\nDr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said the United States had learned from other countries like China and South Korea, which were able to control the spread of the virus through strict measures and widespread testing.\n\n\"Those were eight- to 10-week curves,\" she said on Monday, adding that \"each state and each hot spot in the United States is going to be its own curve because the seeds came in at different times.\"\n\nDr. Birx added that the response \"has to be very tailored geographically and it may have to be tailored by age group, really understanding who's at the greatest risk and understanding how to protect them.\"\n\nOther advisers, including members of Mr. Trump's economic team, have said repeatedly in recent months that the virus does not itself pose an extraordinary threat to Americans' lives or the economy, likening it to a common flu season. Some advisers believe the White House overreacted to criticism of Mr. Trump's muted actions to deal with the emerging pandemic and gave health experts too large a sway in policymaking.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump echoed those concerns, saying that things like the flu or car accidents posed as much of a threat to Americans as the coronavirus and that the response to those was far less draconian.\n\n\"We have a very active flu season, more active than most. It's looking like it's heading to 50,000 or more deaths,\" he said, adding: \"That's a lot. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we're talking about. That doesn't mean we're going to tell everybody no more driving of cars. So we have to do things to get our country open.\"\n\nMr. Trump has watched as a record economic expansion and booming stock market that served as the basis of his re-election campaign evaporated in a matter of weeks. The president became engaged with the discussion on Sunday evening, after watching television reports and hearing from various business officials and outside advisers who were agitating for an end to the shutdown.\n\nCasey Mulligan, a University of Chicago professor who served as chief economist for Mr. Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, said on Monday that efforts to shut down economic activity to slow the virus would be more damaging than doing nothing at all. He suggested a middle ground, one that weighs the costs and benefits of saving additional lives.\n\n\"It's a little bit like, when you discover sex can be dangerous, you don't come out and say, there should be no more sex,\" Mr. Mulligan said. \"You should give people guidance on how to have sex less dangerously.\"\n\nMany other economists say the restrictions in activity now are helping the economy in the long run, by beginning to suppress the infection rate.\n\n\"The idea that there's a trade-off between health and economics right now is likely badly mistaken,\" said Jason Furman of Harvard University, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama. \"The thing damaging our economy is a virus. Everyone who is trying to stop that virus is working to limit the damage it does to our economy and help our eventual rebound. The choice may well be taking pretty extreme steps now or taking very extreme steps later.\"\n\nMr. Furman and other economists have pushed Mr. Trump and Congress to ease the economic pain by offering trillions of dollars in government assistance to affected workers and businesses. As lawmakers tried to negotiate an agreement on such a bill Monday, an influential business lobbying group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said it supported restrictions on the economy to slow the virus.\n\n\"Our view is, when it comes to how you contain the virus, you do everything the public health professionals say to contain the virus,\" said Neil Bradley, the chamber's executive vice president and chief policy officer.\n\nThe president's suggestion that the response may be an overreaction plays into doubts already held by some Americans suffering the economic consequences. Among the self-quarantined, some have questioned the purpose of isolating themselves if the virus is already circulating widely. Students sent home from college have wondered whether they are more likely to infect higher-risk older adults at home.\n\nDan Patrick, Texas' lieutenant governor, said Monday on Fox News that he was in the \"high-risk pool\" but would be willing to risk his life to preserve the country for his children and grandchildren.\n\n\"We are going to be in a total collapse, recession, depression, collapse in our society,\" said Mr. Patrick, who turns 70 next week. \"If this goes on another several months, there won't be any jobs to come back to for many people.\"\n\nBut public health officials stress that there would be consequences to ending the measures too quickly. In a tweet on Monday morning, Thomas P. Bossert, the former homeland security adviser who for weeks has been vocal about the need for the U.S. government to take stricter measures, said: \"Sadly, the numbers now suggest the U.S. is poised to take the lead in #coronavirus cases. It's reasonable to plan for the US to top the list of countries with the most cases in approximately 1 week. This does NOT make social intervention futile. It makes it imperative!\"\n\nMr. Trump's interest in potentially easing some of the restrictions met with pushback from one of his close allies, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who himself self-quarantined after a potential exposure. \"President Trump's best decision was stopping travel from China early on,\" Mr. Graham tweeted on Monday. \"I hope we will not undercut that decision by suggesting we back off aggressive containment policies within the United States.\"\n\nHealth officials remain largely united in defense of sustaining the restrictions.\n\n\"There is a way to think through how and when to start reopening our economy and society, and it's important to get this right,\" said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDr. Tom Inglesby, the director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, pointed to the experience of countries like Italy, which did not institute aggressive measures to stop the spread of the virus and saw infection rates and deaths soar as a result.\n\nThe United States will need \"a couple weeks\" to see positive effects from its measures, Dr. Inglesby said, and abandoning them would mean \"patients will get sick in extraordinary numbers all over the country, far beyond what the U.S. health care system will bear.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, David E.

Coronavirus Outbreak Here's what you need to know:White House: Anyone who has left New York should self-quarantine.Stocks surge on promise of a bailout as companies and workers navigate the crisis.Innovators race to help as hospitals plead for equipment.The country's second-biggest state is not on lockdown.A teenager who died in California is one of the youngest victims in the United States.India's prime minister decreed a 21-day lockdown for the country of 1.3 billion.Emerging markets could be crushed by coronavirus.White House: Anyone who has left New York should self-quarantine.\n\nExperts on the White House Coronavirus Task Force expressed alarm on Tuesday over infection rates in New York City, and advised people who have passed through or left the city to place themselves into 14-day quarantine.\n\nNew York City is now being treated the way parts of China and Europe have been viewed, as an epidemiological hot zone. As of Tuesday morning, New York State had 25,665 cases, with at least 157 deaths. There were around 15,000 cases in New York City alone.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida expanded his efforts to quarantine visitors from New York, saying he would sign an order extending a self-isolation requirement to anyone who had traveled from the New York area in the last three weeks. Dr. Birx said that about 60 percent of all the new cases in the country were coming out of the metro New York area.\n\n\"New York City definitely is a very hot spot,\" President Trump said.\n\nEven as nations from Britain to India declare nationwide economic lockdowns, President Trump said he \"would love to have the country opened up, and just raring to go, by Easter,\" less than three weeks away, a goal that top health professionals have called far too quick.\n\n\"I think it's possible, why not?\" he said with a shrug.\n\nStocks surge on promise of a bailout as companies and workers navigate the crisis.\n\nThe S&P 500 had its biggest daily gain since 2008 on Tuesday, rising more than 9 percent, as Congress neared agreement on a stimulus bill to stabilize America's faltering economy. Shares of companies likely to receive bailouts, such as airlines, cruise lines and casinos, soared. Norwegian Cruise Lines was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 on Tuesday, jumping more than 40 percent, while Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines all rose more than 20 percent.\n\nBut investors are still fragile and could sour on stocks if the promised deal hits a snag again. The U.S. government will report weekly jobless claims on Thursday, and some analysts expect the data to show that millions of Americans became unemployed last week.\n\nInnovators race to help as hospitals plead for equipment.\n\nHealth care workers on the front lines of the pandemic are in desperate need of more personal protective equipment. The C.D.C. has even said scarves or bandannas can be used for protection as a last resort.\n\nThis growing demand has mobilized a wide range of innovators, including engineers and high school students, many of them sharing information through online platforms like Slack. They're pitching in by designing 3D printable masks and face shields that can be reproduced around the world. Some of this equipment is already in the hands of clinicians, and the makers are looking to drastically scale up their production soon.\n\nDoctors are hopeful that these types of efforts will prevent the problem from getting worse. \"I hope it never gets to the point where we have to wear a bandanna,\" said Dr. Susan Gunn, a senior physician in pulmonary and critical care at Ochsner Health. \"And I don't think with this initiative we'll get there.\"\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 410,600 people in at least 166 countries.\n\nThe country's second-biggest state is not on lockdown.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday continued to resist calls to issue a statewide order to keep millions of Texans in their homes as protection against the fast-moving virus, but he used strong language to encourage Texans to stay indoors.\n\n\"The best thing that you can do to ensure that we are not spreading Covid-19 in the state of Texas is stay home, unless you need to be out,\" Mr. Abbott said, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nThe country's second-biggest state has been improvising its way through the crisis, influenced at times by the sheer span of Texas, by its partisan divides, by its rural-versus-urban split, by its top leaders' support of Mr. Trump and by its small-government, low-regulation mythos.\n\nA regulatory patchwork has unfolded in recent days, with restrictions, curfews and stay-at-home orders that change from county to county. Lacking a statewide mandate, several cities and counties have issued their own stay-at-home orders for residents, covering cities like Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Houston, Fort Worth, Arlington and El Paso.\n\nTexas has more than 700 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 11 deaths, with most of the cases in major metropolitan areas. In nearly 190 of the state's 254 counties, the most of any state, there are no confirmed cases at all.\n\nA teenager who died in California is one of the youngest victims in the United States.\n\nA person under the age of 18 died from the disease caused by the coronavirus, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said on Tuesday, becoming one of the youngest victims in the United States.\n\nThe death in Los Angeles County, Calif., was the first known instance of a minor dying from the coronavirus in the United States. Some states, including New York, which has the most deaths in the country, have not reported the ages of most victims.\n\nThe young victim was from Lancaster, Calif., officials said. They did not provide any more details about whether the person had underlying health conditions.\n\nWhile the risk of dying is significantly higher in older people, C.D.C. data on nearly 2,500 of the first recorded cases in the United States has shown that younger adults made up a significant portion of coronavirus hospitalizations.\n\nIndia's prime minister decreed a 21-day lockdown for the country of 1.3 billion.\n\nIndia, the world's second-most populous country, will order its 1.3 billion people to stay inside their homes for three weeks to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared on Tuesday.\n\nThe extensive lockdown order was declared a day after the authorities there grounded all domestic flights.\n\n\"Every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown,\" he said. \"If you can't handle these 21 days, this country will go back 21 years.\"\n\nThough India's number of reported coronavirus cases remains relatively low, around 500, the fear is that if the virus hits as it has in the United States, Europe or China, it could be a disaster far bigger than anywhere else.\n\nEmerging markets could be crushed by coronavirus.\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic brings the global economy to an astonishing halt, the world's most vulnerable countries are suffering intensifying harm.\n\nBusinesses faced with the disappearance of sales are laying off workers. Households short of income are skimping on food. International investment is fleeing so-called emerging markets at a pace not seen since the global financial crisis of 2008, diminishing the value of currencies and forcing people to pay more for imported goods like food and fuel.\n\nFrom South Asia to Africa to Latin America, the pandemic is confronting developing countries with a public health emergency combined with an economic crisis, each exacerbating the other. The same forces are playing out in wealthy nations, too. But in poor countries -- where billions of people live in proximity to calamity even in the best of times -- the dangers are amplified.\n\nCities are threatened by their own density.\n\nIt has been an especially painful realization in major cities: The very thing that makes cities remarkable -- the proximity of so many people to one another -- is now making them susceptible in a pandemic. Density, suddenly, is bad for our health. And we are trying everything we can think of to dismantle it.\n\nSpecial grocery store hours for older people -- those are about reducing density. Closed schools and dispersed children -- the same.\n\nTelework is the least dense version of office life; takeout the least dense way to eat someone else's cooking. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has even suggested opening roads normally reserved for cars to pedestrian traffic. An empty street is the least dense way to walk somewhere, even in a seemingly empty city.\n\n\"There is a density level in NYC that is destructive,\" he tweeted Sunday, after similar comments at one of his daily press briefings. He'd seen New Yorkers out in parks together, behaving as if this were a normal sunny spring weekend, and he was dismayed. Togetherness itself could now be deadly.\n\n\"It has to stop and it has to stop now,\" he tweeted. \"NYC must develop an immediate plan to reduce density.\"\n\nSeeing the coronavirus as a marathon fight? Here are some tips.\n\nExperts say the coronavirus crisis is likely to last for a long time -- and for many people confined to their homes, the novelty is beginning to wear off. Here are some tips to help you fight the burnout you may feel, manage your antsy teenagers, and even freshen up your home to make it better suited to meet your new needs.", "source": {"uri":

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/opinion/doctors-coronavirus-safety.html", "title": "Opinion | Doctors Are Writing Their Wills", "body": "Ms. Weiss is an Opinion staff writer and editor, and the author of \"How to Fight Anti-Semitism.\"\n\nMichelle Au works at Emory St. Joseph's Hospital in Atlanta, Ga. These days she feels like she works at Chernobyl.\n\nAs an anesthesiologist, Dr. Au is responsible for one of the most dangerous parts of tending to patients with the coronavirus: intubating those who can't breathe. The procedure, which involves snaking a tube into the patient's trachea, is so dangerous because it brings the doctor close to the patient's mouth, which is constantly shedding the virus. Patients sometimes exhale or cough as the tube is inserted, which aerosolizes the virus, allowing it to hang in the air for several hours.\n\nLast week Dr. Au intubated two patients with Covid-19. \"You're aware of every moment you're in there,\" she told me. \"Ten seconds. Twenty seconds. Thirty seconds. You feel radioactive.\"\n\n\"Have you seen the HBO show 'Chernobyl?' \" she asked. \"There are invisible risks that trail you.\"\n\nThose invisible risks -- a trace of the coronavirus under a fingernail or on a strand of hair -- don't give Dr. Au nightmares just because she is worried about her own health and that of her colleagues. It's because waiting at home she has a husband and three children.\n\nAnd so every day before she leaves the hospital, Dr. Au takes a shower, washes her hair and changes clothes. Then she does the same thing at home, her old clothes now contaminated because she wore them in her car. Last, she takes a diluted bleach solution and wipes down every surface she has touched: doorknobs, car handle, phone and so on.\n\nNot long ago she would have thought these precautions were crazy. \"Now,\" she said, \"it seems completely reasonable.\"\n\nFor two weeks she has slept in the basement, while her husband, a surgeon, sleeps in their bedroom, because, \"One of us has to stay healthy.\"\n\nDr. Au's situation is not the exception, but the rule, among doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients.\n\nSince the end of February, Dr. John Marshall, the chairman of emergency medicine at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, has slept in a separate room from his wife. (\"The dog chose her over me.\")\n\nLiving at home allows Dr. Marshall to see his sons -- 11, 13 and 15 -- for the hour or two a day when he isn't sleeping or working at the hospital, where dozens of patients with Covid-19 are being treated. But others in his hospital have sent their families to safer ground or chosen to protect them by staying alone in an Airbnb.\n\nAs soon as next week, Columbia University is planning to turn some of its dorms over to doctors and other health care workers so they can avoid long commutes and the risk of infecting others, according to a university spokesman.\n\nSome doctors already have the virus. Dr. Richa Bhardwaj is a gastroenterology fellow at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan; her husband is also a doctor. He tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. They have a 5-month-old daughter who is breastfeeding.\n\nThe family has now split up.\n\nDr. Bhardwaj's husband is at her brother's house in Yonkers; she is in her bedroom waiting for her own test results; and the baby is in the guest room with her in-laws.\n\n\"I haven't seen my baby since yesterday,\" she said. She wonders if the baby would be safer living somewhere else. \"I'm so conflicted,\" she said. She's pumping milk so her in-laws can feed the baby, but she's terrified of getting her -- or her in-laws -- sick.\n\n\"We know what to do when a gunshot wound comes in; we know what to do when someone comes in with sepsis or a heart attack,\" Dr. Marshall told me. \"In this instance there isn't certainty about how to protect yourself. And so there is also uncertainty about how to protect your family.\"\n\n\"If I could marinate myself in sanitizer I would,\" said Dr. Sharon Levine, the section chief for geriatric medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\nEarly research shows that health care workers are more likely to contract the coronavirus than the average person and, when they get it, to suffer more severe symptoms. Many doctors are already rationing the protective gowns, gloves and masks that are necessary to keep them safe.\n\nThey are also drawing up their wills.\n\nDr. Au and her husband sat down over the weekend and updated the list of who should take care of their children if both of them die. \"We have it four deep now,\" she said. \"The top two choices are older and these people are in a high-risk group. The third person is a doctor. So we added a fourth person who is a low risk for contracting this thing. As the backstop in case it comes to that.\"\n\nDr. Jane van Dis is an ob-gyn in Los Angeles and the medical director for Maven, a telemedicine platform. She is also a single mother. \"I realized that if something happened to me that my life is all in my head,\" she told me. \"So on Saturday I combed through all of my policies -- life insurance and disability -- and all of my credit cards, my mortgage, my auto loan, trying to think of all of the details of my life so that if someone were trying to take it over for me they could.\"\n\nDr. Marshall said he's been encouraging his colleagues who don't yet have wills to draw them up. \"We know what's coming,\" he told me. \"There are a good number of people who are going to die here,\" he said, and \"health care workers will be part of that number.\"\n\nDr. Vicki Jackson, the chief of palliative care and geriatrics at Mass General, said she recently told her husband that she wants him to remarry if she dies. \"But it's important to me that she be spunky,\" she told him. \"No milquetoast role models for the kids.\"\n\nThese are the kinds of conversations that many doctors have spent their careers urging patients facing serious illness to have. They are now showing us how it's done.\n\n\"Most people are in complete denial that your life can change on a dime,\" said Dr. Jackson. \"In medicine we know it, and we are more likely to talk about it.\" Because of the coronavirus outbreak, she added, \"the veil is less opaque right now. And I don't think that's bad.\"\n\nIn a sense, Dr. Jackson was built for this moment: Her medical practice and scholarly work are focused on helping patients and their families answer questions like: What does quality of life mean for me? What would I be willing to go through to get more time?\n\nRight now, she says, that conversation comes easily. \"It is like the pandemic has allowed patients to be more courageous, more clear.\"\n\nHer colleague, Dr. Levine, has spent the past couple of weeks talking to older patients about whether their wishes for end-of-life care have changed in light of the coronavirus.\n\nOne patient, she told me, didn't want her chart to just say \"I don't want to be intubated.\" She \"wanted it specifically to be stated that if someone needed a ventilator more than she did, that they should have it.\"\n\nEvery doctor I spoke to talked about the fear of running out of ventilators and protective gear like masks. They are universally shocked by the way this pandemic has revealed the precariousness of the American health care system.\n\n\"Who would imagine that in the United States of America doctors would have to go on social media begging for supplies?\" Dr. Au asked. \"Patients are calling in and saying: I found three N95 masks in my toolbox. Can I bring them by? They came to drop them off to me in the hospital driveway.\"\n\n\"In first world medicine, there are certain supplies we assume are there,\" she said, comparing it to turning on the faucet and assuming water will come out. She said it was \"very, very shocking to see how close we were to the knife's edge.\" This is part of the reason she said she is running for the Georgia State Senate this year.\n\n\"You have trusted the system your whole life to keep you safe,\" she said. \"You keep waiting for the system to kick in. But you realize no one's coming to save us.\"\n\nDr. Jackson put it this way: \"We are standing on the edge of the ocean in the dark. We're waiting for the wave to hit and we have no idea how high the wave is going to be.\"\n\nFor now, they are working. Eighty, sometimes 100 hours a week. Days bleed into each other. They don't stop.\n\nI asked Dr. Bhardwaj if she ever thinks of quitting. \"Being a mom now, it's more challenging than before, because I am responsible for the baby,\" she said. \"But I wouldn't change the fact that I'm a doctor. I would never walk away.\"\n\nDr. Au told me she was recently talking to a friend from high school, someone who doesn't work in medicine. \"And he said: 'How are you feeling aside from all this?' And I said: 'There is nothing besides this.' \"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

"Opinion | Trump to New York: Drop Dead", "body": "Untold thousands will likely die, absent federal intervention. And it needs to happen this instant. Why won't the president help?\n\nSo it's essentially come to this: President Trump is treating each of our 50 states as individual contestants on \"The Apprentice\" -- pitting them against one another for scarce resources, daring them to duke it out -- rather than mobilizing a unified national response to a pandemic.\n\nIf that's the case, this is the episode where New York loses. The coronavirus is whipping through the state, especially New York City, at a terrifying rate. We need personnel, ventilators and personal protective equipment, stat.\n\nBut Trump's response has been the same as President Gerald Ford's in 1975, when our city, faltering on the brink of insolvency, begged Washington for help and was brutally rebuffed, a moment forever enshrined in The Daily News's headline \"FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD.\"\n\nNow Trump is telling us the same. Literally.\n\nUntold thousands will likely die absent federal intervention. And it needs to happen this instant -- not just for the good of the city, but for the nation. The president needs to set a precedent in his hometown.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Gov. Andrew Cuomo opened his daily coronavirus briefing on a far more somber note than usual, noting that the number of cases was climbing at a faster rate than even the experts had predicted, doubling roughly every three days. \"The apex is higher than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought,\" he said. \"That is a bad combination of facts.\"\n\nWhat it means, practically speaking: Our hospitals will soon be overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients. The governor has already said that the state is 30,000 ventilators short. The only way to acquire the volume we need -- delivered at the speed we need -- is through federal intervention, which means sending us the bulk of the ventilators from the strategic national stockpile, which has roughly 20,000, and deploying the Defense Production Act to force private manufacturers to make more.\n\nBut that's not what the president is doing. He refuses to use the Defense Production Act, fearing it'll put an undue burden on business, and he's keeping his federal stash under tight lock and key. On Tuesday morning, Cuomo confirmed that FEMA would be sending the state only 400 ventilators. (\"What are we going to do with 400 ventilators when we need 30,000?\" he asked.) Vice President Mike Pence later said he'd send New York 4,000 from the stockpile -- a fine start, but nowhere near what New York needs.\n\nWhat is the president waiting for, and why is he hoarding -- or let's be charitable and say husbanding -- his resources? Must the death toll in New York prove so calamitous he needs no further proof? Is he trying to make an example of his former home?\n\n\"I will take personal responsibility for transporting the 20,000 ventilators anywhere in this country that they want, once we are past our apex,\" Cuomo said. \"But don't leave them sitting in a stockpile, and say, 'Well, we're going to wait and see how we allocate them across the country.' That's not how this works.\"\n\nIt would be one thing if other states were in the same dire position as New York. But they aren't. We have 10 times the number of cases as Washington and eight times that of California. New Yorkers are now locked in place, waiting for the wave to come. As of Tuesday night, Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, recommends that New Yorkers self-quarantine if they leave the state. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is ordering anyone flying in from New York to self-quarantine for 14 days upon landing.\n\nI guess Trump likes the numbers where they are. I have news for him: They won't stay that way. The idea that New York is an exception rather than a harbinger is madness.\n\nThe rest of the country may regard New York as a black hole of need. But in fact the opposite has always been true; we're forever sweeping more into the federal till than we receive in services. In 2018, according to the state comptroller's office, we gave $26.6 billion more to Washington than we got back, ranking us dead last for federal benefits.\n\nNow, we finally have a native New Yorker in the White House to do something about this discrepancy. Instead, he's the worst offender, and this time the consequences will be lethal.\n\nPart of me can't help but wonder if Trump is just playing to his base, which views cities with suspicion, perhaps New York above all. We are multiculturalism personified -- home of the United Nations, a place where 637 languages and dialects are spoken. A pur\u00e9e while the rest of the nation is vegetable soup, as Spalding Gray once lovingly said.\n\nNever mind that Trump is himself a creature of New York, just a different dimension of New York. Tabloid New York, real estate New York and (above all, and most ironically) global New York, which made possible his worldwide hotels, his construction projects made of Chinese steel, his loans from Deutsche Bank. It's a New York he now disavows. A New York he now blames.\n\nBut it was New York that made him a reality television star. And what reality television prizes more than anything, we've learned, is a Darwinian frame of mind. The contestants aren't there to make friends. They're there to destroy each other. They're there to win. Only the best win.\n\nBut this is not a game. Trump has no clue how to marshal the forces of federal government, which he stripped down to the studs. He has no unifying instincts at all. New York will be gasping for breath, and the other states will soon follow. Unless he takes action, now.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

other states worry about domestic contagion.Spanish soldiers find residents of nursing homes 'absolutely abandoned.'Democrats and Treasury say they are close to a compromise on $2 trillion economic package.Public transit to start up again in Wuhan within 24 hours as concerns simmer about 'silent spreader' cases.President Trump hints at a short shutdown: 'I'm not looking at months.'Britain is placed under a virtual lockdown.As lockdowns spread, debate about costs grows.\n\nWith more states across America ordering millions to stay home, and Britain joining the rest of Europe in shuttering nonessential businesses and placing its population under what one newspaper called \"house arrest,\" voices of disquiet over the economic cost of such measures grew louder, even as public health experts warned that relaxing restrictions could significantly increase the death toll.\n\nOnly one week after the White House released guidelines for all Americans to keep their distance, President Trump said it could soon be time to consider a more targeted approach.\n\n\"Life is fragile and economies are fragile,\" the president said on Monday.\n\nMillions have already lost their jobs and the foundations of the global economy have been shaken.\n\nMortgage markets showed signs of crumbling, companies struggled to sell debt and stresses plagued the entire financial system.\n\nThe Federal Reserve promised to buy as much government-backed debt as needed to bolster the markets on Monday, but stocks on Wall Street still fell. There were hopeful signs on Tuesday, however, as Asian markets rebounded smartly. Lawmakers in Washington expressed optimism that they would reach a deal on a nearly $2 trillion stimulus bill, although those efforts have until now fallen victim to partisan wrangling.\n\nPublic health officials continued to warn of impending disaster in the absence of stronger restrictions on movement, saying the uncontrolled spread of the virus could overwhelm health care systems around the world.\n\nIn New York, where 157 people have died and 2,600 remain hospitalized, officials raced to prepare for a coming tsunami of patients.\n\nDr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said the \"attack rate\" -- the percentage of the population infected with the virus -- was nearly one in 1,000 in the New York area, five times higher than in other parts of the country.\n\n\"To all of my friends and colleagues in New York, this is the group that needs to absolutely social distance and self-isolate at this time,\" she said.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, even as the crisis grew in Spain and France and Britain prepared for worse days to come, health officials could point to first glimpses of hope.\n\nTwo weeks after Italy was completely locked down, its number of new cases and deaths declined for two days in a row.\n\nThe number of patients in the hospitals in Lombardy, the region that is by far the hardest hit in Italy, fell as well, to 9,266 from 9,439.\n\n\"We can say that today is the first positive day,\" said Giulio Gallera, Lombardy's leading health official. \"It's not the moment to sing victory, but we finally see light at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 369,400 people in at least 165 countries.\n\nAs the epidemic in New York explodes, other states worry about domestic contagion.\n\nNew York City has about a third of the nation's confirmed coronavirus cases, making it the new epicenter of the outbreak in the United States.\n\nAnd hospitals across the region reported increasing numbers of cases as workers warned about shortages in protective equipment.\n\nMr. Cuomo announced plans to send hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves and gowns to health care facilities, and said the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan would be repurposed as four \"emergency hospitals.\"\n\nNew York's population density may help explain why the infection rate is so high.\n\nNew York is far more crowded than any other major city in the United States. It has 28,000 residents per square mile, while San Francisco, the next densest city, has 17,000, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nAll of those people, in such a small space, appear to have helped the virus spread rapidly through packed subway trains, busy playgrounds and apartment buildings, forming ever-widening circles of infections. The city now has more coronavirus cases per capita than even Italy.\n\nGov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York is requiring hospitals to increase capacity by at least 50 percent. New York State saw a one-day increase of nearly 5,000 cases, putting the total at 21,689 as of Monday night.\n\nWith the epidemic in New York exploding, other states rushed to protect themselves.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said he was planning to sign an executive order requiring anyone flying to the state from New York or New Jersey to enter quarantine for 14 days.\n\nMany cases in places like Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach have been tied to New York, and a recent uptick in travel from the region suggested New Yorkers were flying to Florida to flee shelter-in-place orders.\n\n\"Hopefully that will be a deterrent for people if you're just trying to escape here,\" Mr. DeSantis said. The quarantine will not apply to people arriving by car.\n\nSpanish soldiers find residents of nursing homes 'absolutely abandoned.'\n\nThe Spanish army has found elderly people abandoned in several nursing homes, raising alarm for those most vulnerable and in need of care with much of life in the country shut down.\n\nThe government will be \"forceful\" in its response to those who abandon older people, Margarita Robles, Spain's defense minister, said Monday in an interview with Telecinco, a Spanish television channel. Officials did not say how many had died or whether residents had succumbed to coronavirus-related illness or a lack of care.\n\nMs. Robles said that emergency military units dispatched to disinfect nursing homes had found there some residents \"absolutely abandoned, if not dead in their beds.\"\n\nThe defense ministry said that dead bodies had been found in multiple nursing homes that had discharged large number of employees in the wake of the outbreaks, but did not provide further details, El Pa\u00eds, a daily broadsheet, reported.\n\nWorkers at nursing homes have been calling for protective equipment as residents and fellow employees became infected with the coronavirus, leaving them short-handed and at personal risk in their workplaces. Representatives of the industry have called on the government to support them, rather than criticize them.\n\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Ram\u00edrez, the president of a Spanish association of directors of social services, said that it was \"shameful\" for the Spanish defense minister to vilify nursing home employees, and that the government should instead take a close look at its own failure to protect these \"heroes,\" who have often been forced to leave their work after themselves contracting the coronavirus.\n\n\"Those in the field are working themselves to the bone without resources, without health support, without protective equipment,\" he said, according to the newspaper El Pa\u00eds.\n\nSpanish prosecutors began investigating reports of nursing home residents living in poor sanitation conditions last week after at least 19 people died in the Monte Hermoso nursing home in Madrid.\n\nLast weekend, the Spanish government announced that it would extend the country's lockdown until at least April 11. Spain, with almost 2,700 deaths, remains the country hardest hit by the coronavirus in Europe after Italy.\n\nDemocrats and Treasury say they are close to a compromise on $2 trillion economic package.\n\nThe Senate's top Democrat and the treasury secretary said on Monday night that they were close to a deal on a nearly $2 trillion economic stabilization package to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe announcement came hours after Democrats voted for the second time to block action until they had secured more worker protections and restrictions on bailed-out companies.\n\n\"We expect to have an agreement in the morning,\" Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, told reporters just before midnight, as he wrapped up a final meeting with Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary. \"There are still a few little differences,\" he said.\n\nMr. Mnuchin said the two sides were very close to a compromise, though both sides cautioned there was no final agreement and the negotiations remained fluid. The two men called President Trump just before they broke for the night.\n\nMr. Schumer said the president's response had been \"very positive,\" despite a tweet just minutes before in which Mr. Trump accused Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of sabotaging the package and wanting \"the virus to win.\"\n\nThe apparent progress came after Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Schumer spent hours haggling behind closed doors. Among other areas of contention, Democrats had demanded restrictions and oversight requirements over a proposed $500 billion fund to bail out distressed companies.\n\nDemocrats voted against moving forward with the plan Monday afternoon, sending markets plummeting. But after more discussion, late Monday night Mr. Schumer said he was hopeful that both sides could now come together quickly, with a vote possible by Tuesday evening.\n\nPublic transit to start up again in Wuhan within 24 hours as concerns simmer about 'silent spreader' cases.\n\nThe central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the global outbreak started, said on Tuesday that public transportation would resume within 24 hours and residents would be allowed to leave the city beginning April 8 as infections appeared to be dwindling after a weekslong lockdown.\n\nEven as local infections across China appeared to approach zero, the Wuhan government on Tuesday said a hospital doctor had tested positive, adding to evidence that Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital, has not beaten the virus.\n\nIn Wuhan, the authorities continue to turn up cases of people with the virus but without symptoms, fueling growing fears among the Chinese public that the government has failed to disclose or discover a much larger number of infections than the 81,171 cases that have been reported.\n\nIn China, officials only count patients with both symptoms and a positive test in the official tally of confirmed cases. The World Health Organization says that all people who test positive are confirmed to be infected, even if they show no symptoms.\n\nChina's approach to counting raises questions about how many people with the virus are circulating freely. There is evidence that asymptomatic people can infect others.\n\nThe number of \"silent carriers\" -- people who are infected but show delayed or no symptoms -- could be as high as a third of those who test positive, the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, reported on Sunday, citing classified Chinese government data.\n\nAfter social media accounts circulated over the weekend that China was suppressing the numbers by failing to acknowledge these \"silent carriers,\" authorities in Wuhan said a patient in the city had tested positive despite not having symptoms.\n\nThe Wuhan health commission also stated that infected patients with no symptoms still need to be isolated for 14 days and that \"a small number may progress to confirmed cases.\"\n\nLast week, China reported no new local infections for the first time since the outbreak began three months ago. But it is now struggling with imported cases, which continue to rise.\n\nBut for many public health experts, these developments add to doubts that the virus will be fully eradicated in China in the near term.\n\nPresident Trump hints at a short shutdown: 'I'm not looking at months.'\n\nPresident Trump, in a nearly two-hour coronavirus briefing, hinted on Monday that the economic shutdown meant to halt the spread of the virus across the country would not be extended.\n\n\"America will again and soon be open for business,\" the president said, without providing a timeline for when he believes normal economic activity could resume. He later added, \"I'm not looking at months, I can tell you right now.\"\n\n\"If it were up to the doctors, they'd say let's shut down the entire world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This could create a much bigger problem than the problem that you started out with.\"\n\nMr. Trump also suggested that he would soon re-evaluate the federal guidance urging social distancing. More states moved on Monday to impose their own sweeping stay-at-home orders, which will soon cover more than 158 million Americans in 16 states.\n\nWashington, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Wisconsin, West Virginia and Oregon became the latest states to announce sweeping directives to keep more people home in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nMr. Trump sent mixed signals from the White House podium, agreeing at one point with his surgeon general and saying, \"It's going to be bad,\" then suggesting that the response to the virus may have been overblown.\n\n\"This is going away,\" Mr. Trump said, citing jobs, \"anxiety and depression\" and suicide as arguments for restoring the U.S. economy.\n\nHe compared deaths from the novel coronavirus so far to deaths from other causes -- influenza and car accidents -- suggesting that the scale of those preventable deaths means economic restrictions may not be appropriate.\n\nWhile it is true that those causes of death outnumber deaths from the virus to date, projections from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that deaths from Covid-19 could range from 200,000 to 1.7 million people. Estimates from other scientists place the potential deaths in a range from several hundred thousand to several million deaths, substantially more than annual deaths from car accidents and flu combined.\n\nSee Which States and Cities Have Told Residents to Stay at Home\n\nAs states attempt to stop the spread of coronavirus, nearly half of all Americans will soon be under instructions to stay at home.\n\nBritain is placed under a virtual lockdown.\n\nFacing a growing storm of criticism about his laissez-faire response to the fast-spreading coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that he would place Britain under a virtual lockdown, closing all nonessential shops, banning meetings of more than two people, and requiring people to stay in their homes, except for trips for food or medicine.\n\nPeople who flout the new restrictions, the prime minister said, would be fined by the police.\n\nThe steps, which Mr. Johnson outlined in a televised address to the nation, bring him into alignment with European leaders like President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who have all but quarantined their countries in a desperate bid to slow the outbreak.\n\n\"No prime minister wants to enact measures like this,\" an ashen-faced Mr. Johnson said. \"I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people's lives, to their businesses and to their jobs.\"\n\nBut while these were the most draconian restrictions placed on the British people since World War II, Mr. Johnson is still leaving a bit of breathing room.\n\nThe prime minister said people could leave their houses for exercise, either alone or with family members, and he did not close parks in London, though several boroughs in the capital have closed the parks they control.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases in Britain rose to 6,650 on Monday, up from 5,683 a day earlier, while the death toll jumped by 54, to 335. British officials believe that those numbers are about to balloon.\n\nPhilippine and Thai leaders grab for emergency powers, raising concerns about potential abuse.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has been granted sweeping emergency powers to combat coronavirus, triggering fears in a nation that spent the 1970s and '80s under brutal martial law.\n\nMr. Duterte, who has drawn international rebuke for his bloody and ruthless war on drugs, said he needed the powers granted to him in the legislation to address the crisis and unlock some $5.4 billion.\n\nAn earlier version of the bill would have allowed Mr. Duterte's government to take over privately owned businesses. While the version that passed Tuesday was scaled back, some legislators have worried that Mr. Duterte will abuse the public funds.\n\n\"This limitless grant of emergency powers is tantamount to autocracy,\" Concerned Lawyers for Civil Liberties, an association of rights lawyers, said in a statement. The group, which includes some of the Philippines' top legal minds, pointed out that in the past Mr. Duterte had likened the constitution to a \"scrap of toilet paper.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand declared a state of emergency, effective on Thursday, to combat the coronavirus, raising similar concerns about a potential abuse of power. Mr. Prayuth, a retired general who led an army coup in 2014, gave himself the authority to impose curfews, censor the media and prevent people from leaving their homes.\n\nMr. Prayuth, who announced the state of emergency while wearing a loose facial mask made of Thai silk, said that people should be careful when using social media, lest they spread rumors. So far the virus has killed four people and infected more than 820 people in the country.\n\nA bed shortage looms in California as testing continues to lag.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom estimates that California will be short about 17,000 hospital beds, although the state is frantically trying to source thousands more of them. And the pace of testing remains stubbornly slow in California.\n\nNew York State, with half the population of California, has conducted twice as many tests for the virus. As of Monday, New York has tested 78,289 people, including 33,000 in New York City. California had conducted 26,400 tests by Sunday, the most recent data available.\n\nOfficials in California have rushed to reopen hospitals that had been shuttered, buy motels to house the state's more than 150,000 homeless people and retrofit college dormitories to serve as hospital wards.\n\nMr. Newsom said the state was also chartering flights to China to procure protective equipment and expressed concern for smaller states that might not have the same purchasing power. He has called up the National Guard to work at food banks, and President Trump ordered a Navy hospital ship, with a thousand beds, to sail to the Port of Los Angeles within a week.\n\nIn Texas and Ohio, abortion is declared 'nonessential.'\n\nA new front in the political fight over abortion has been sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTexas and Ohio have included abortions among the nonessential surgeries and medical procedures that they are requiring to be delayed, saying they are trying to preserve precious protective equipment for health care workers and to make space for a potential flood of coronavirus patients.\n\nBut abortion-rights activists said that abortions should be counted as essential and that people could not wait for the procedure until the pandemic was over.\n\nOn Monday, Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, clarified that the postponement of surgeries and medical procedures announced by the governor over the weekend included \"any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.\"\n\nFailure to do so, he said, could result in penalties of up to $1,000 or 180 days of jail time. It was not immediately clear if that included medication abortion, which involves providers administering pills in the earlier stages of pregnancy.\n\nThe move followed a similar action by health authorities in Ohio last week and has prompted a legal scramble by abortion rights groups to preserve access. Activists accused state leaders of using the coronavirus crisis to advance an existing agenda to restrict abortions.\n\nReporting and research were contributed by Raphael Minder, Megan Specia, Marc Santora, Melissa Eddy, Jason Gutierrez, Hannah Beech, Tiffany May, Sui-Lee Wee, Nick Fandos, Sabrina Tavernise, Thomas Fuller, Tim Arango and Jo Becker", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_L._Birx", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deborah L.

Updates: Senate Passes $2 Trillion Stimulus Package", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\n\u65b0\u51a0\u75c5\u6bd2\u75ab\u60c5\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\n\nHere's what you need to know:The Senate unanimously passed a $2 trillion stimulus plan.At one New York City hospital, an 'apocalyptic' surge.For Peace Corps volunteers, a sudden and sad evacuation.Fauci sees signs of the virus becoming cyclical, like the flu.Essential businesses? Given latitude, some retailers choose to stay open.How to manage your anxiety and its side effects.The Senate unanimously passed a $2 trillion stimulus plan.\n\nThe Senate voted unanimously on Wednesday to approve a sweeping, $2 trillion fiscal measure to shore up the United States economy as it weathers the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, advancing the largest fiscal stimulus package in modern American history.\n\nThe House was expected to quickly take up the bill on Friday and pass it, sending it to President Trump for his signature.\n\nThe legislation would send direct payments of $1,200 to Americans earning up to $75,000 -- which would gradually phase out for higher earners and end for those with incomes more than $99,000 -- and an additional $500 per child. It would substantially expand jobless aid, providing an additional 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits, extending them for the first time to freelancers and gig workers and adding $600 per week on top of the usual payment.\n\nThe measure would also provide $350 billion in federally guaranteed loans to small businesses and establish a $500 billion government lending program for distressed companies reeling from the impact of the crisis, allowing the administration to take equity stakes in airlines that received aid to help compensate taxpayers. It would also send $100 billion to hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic.\n\nThe bill was the product of intense bipartisan negotiations among Republicans, Democrats and the White House. Three senators were absent from the late-night roll call because of the novel coronavirus. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has contracted Covid-19, while two Utah Republicans, Senators Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, were in self-isolation out of an abundance of caution after spending time with Mr. Paul. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican, also missed the vote because he wasn't feeling well and had left Washington to return home out of an abundance of caution, a spokesman said.\n\nAt one New York City hospital, an 'apocalyptic' surge.\n\nAt Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, Dr. Ashley Bray performed chest compressions Tuesday on a woman in her 80s, a man in his 60s and a 38-year-old who reminded the doctor of her fianc\u00e9. All had tested positive for the coronavirus. All eventually died.\n\nElmhurst, a 545-bed public hospital, has begun transferring patients not suffering from coronavirus to other facilities as it moves toward becoming a facility dedicated entirely to the outbreak. Doctors and nurses have struggled to make do with a few dozen ventilators. Calls over a loudspeaker of \"Team 700,\" the code for when a patient is on the verge of death, come several times a shift. Some have died inside the emergency room while waiting for a bed.\n\nA refrigerated truck has been stationed outside to hold the bodies of the dead. Over the past 24 hours, New York City's public hospital system said in a statement, 13 people at Elmhurst had died.\n\n\"It's apocalyptic,\" said Dr. Bray, a general medicine resident at the hospital.\n\nAll of the more than 1,800 intensive care units in New York City are expected to be full by Friday, according to a FEMA leadership briefing obtained by The New York Times. Patients could stay for weeks, limiting space for newly sickened residents.\n\nFor Peace Corps volunteers, a sudden and sad evacuation.\n\nThe urgent update from the Peace Corps landed abruptly in the email inboxes of volunteers on March 15: It was time to evacuate.\n\nMiguel Garcia, a 27-year-old volunteer leader in the Dominican Republic, had a job to do. He had 24 hours to get 32 volunteers scattered across the country to Santo Domingo, the capital. Several were about eight hours away in hard-to-reach communities.\n\n\"Panic took over, and I was just mindlessly doing things,\" Mr. Garcia said. \"It wasn't until I came home to an apartment that needed to be packed that it all hit me. I showered in cold water for about 45 minutes and cried, overwhelmed by all of the people I needed to communicate with and say goodbye to.\"\n\nFor the first time in its nearly 60-year history, the Peace Corps has temporarily suspended its operations, evacuating more than 7,000 volunteers from posts in more than 60 countries because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAn independent agency of the U.S. government created by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, the corps sends volunteers abroad to help with social and economic development projects. They dig wells, teach in schools and train people in everything from sewing to healthy breastfeeding.\n\nIn an open letter, Jody Olsen, the director of the Peace Corps, said the move was meant to protect volunteers and prevent them from being stranded during the pandemic. Within hours, volunteers were packing their bags, saying their farewells and rushing to designated meeting places as airlines canceled flights and countries began closing borders.\n\nIn interviews, volunteers described shock, confusion and heartbreak as they arrived back home in the United States.\n\n\"The situation in Morocco went so fast,\" said Elizabeth Burke, 54, who had been in the country for less than a year, teaching English and working at a sewing cooperative. \"It went from Moroccans not being aware of the coronavirus and what was going on to a complete shutdown.\"\n\nFauci sees signs of the virus becoming cyclical, like the flu.\n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday that he was seeing indications that the virus could keep returning as a \"seasonal, cyclic thing,\" like the flu.\n\nOne of the key questions about the virus has been whether its spread would slow or stop in warm weather and return in cold weather, and Dr. Fauci suggested that it may follow that seasonal pattern.\n\n\"What we are starting to see now in the southern hemisphere,\" he said, referring specifically to southern Africa, \"is that we are having cases that are appearing as they go into their winter season. And if, in fact, they have a substantial outbreak, it will be inevitable that we need to be prepared that we will get a cycle around the second time.\"\n\nThat makes it all the more important that scientists \"have a vaccine available for that next cycle,\" as well as \"a menu of drugs that we have shown to be effective and shown to be safe,\" he said.\n\nEssential businesses? Given latitude, some retailers choose to stay open.\n\nIn states hit hard by the coronavirus, like New York and California, governors and mayors have mandated the closure of all but the obviously essential stores, like supermarkets and pharmacies. And the Department of Homeland Security has laid out guidelines for businesses across the country to follow when deciding whether to stay open, even in regions not known to be hot spots for the virus. The agency is careful to note that its definition of a \"critical\" work force is not an official standard, leaving it up to corporations to decide for themselves.\n\nGiven this latitude, retailers have kept thousands of stores open, even as health experts warn that the virus is likely to spread more widely across the country in the coming weeks.\n\nAt some Guitar Center stores, employees are still allowing customers to try out models of guitars. Dillard's, a department store chain popular in the South, is still welcoming shoppers looking for clothing and makeup. And Michaels, the arts and crafts chain, says it is keeping many of its stores open to provide supplies to parents teaching their homebound children. \"We are here for the makers,\" the retailer said in an email to one concerned customer.\n\nThat some retail stores are staying open while other businesses have closed reflects the piecemeal approach to combating the pandemic in the United States. There are emergency orders limiting business to essential retailers in about half the country, but much of the South and West has no such government restrictions.\n\nHow to manage your anxiety and its side effects.\n\nCoronavirus-related anxiety is real and likely impacting many aspects of your life, from your eating habits to the way your children are acting. There is also a grief that comes along with the loss of our daily routines and rituals. Here are some tips to help you get through these tough times.\n\nReporting was contributed by Julie Davis, Emily Cochrane, Nicholas Fandos, Michael Corkery, Sapna Maheshwari and Mariel Padilla.",

In late February and early March, the number of new coronavirus infections exploded from a few dozen, to a few hundred, to several thousand.\n\nAt the peak, medical workers identified 909 new cases in a single day, Feb. 29, and the country of 50 million people appeared on the verge of being overwhelmed. But less than a week later, the number of new cases halved. Within four days, it halved again -- and again the next day.\n\nOn Sunday, the country reported only 64 new cases, the fewest in nearly a month. As new infections in wealthier countries like the United States and Germany soar to thousands daily, South Korea's have stabilized.\n\nSouth Korea is one of only two countries with large outbreaks, alongside China, to flatten the curve of new infections. And it has done so without China's draconian restrictions on speech and movement, or lockdowns like those in Europe and the United States.\n\nItaly, whose outbreak initially paralleled South Korea's, now reports thousands of new cases daily, and hundreds of deaths -- 793 on Saturday alone. In South Korea that day, Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, killed two people. Some days, the toll is zero.\n\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has hailed South Korea as demonstrating that containing the virus, while difficult, \"can be done.\" He urged countries to \"apply the lessons learned in Korea and elsewhere.\"\n\nSouth Korean officials caution that their successes are tentative. A risk of resurgence remains, particularly as epidemics continue raging beyond the country's borders.\n\nStill, as global deaths from the virus surge past 15,000, devastating health care systems and economies, officials and experts worldwide are scrutinizing South Korea for lessons. And those lessons, while hardly easy, appear relatively straightforward and affordable: swift action, widespread testing and contact tracing, and critical support from citizens.\n\nScott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, has repeatedly raised South Korea as a model, writing on Twitter, \"South Korea is showing Covid-19 can be beat with smart, aggressive public health.\"\n\nLesson 1: Intervene Fast, Before It's a Crisis\n\nJust one week after the country's first case was diagnosed in late January, government officials met with representatives from several medical companies. They urged the companies to begin immediately developing coronavirus test kits for mass production, promising emergency approval.\n\nWithin two weeks, though South Korea's confirmed cases remained in the double digits, thousands of test kits were shipping daily. The country now produces 100,000 kits per day, and officials say they are in talks with 17 foreign governments about exporting them.\n\nOfficials also swiftly imposed emergency measures in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million where contagion spread fast through a local church.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak U.S. lawmakers try again on a $1.8 trillion stimulus plan. The Fed says it will buy as much debt as it needs to cushion the blow for businesses. New York is now the center of the U.S. outbreak. See more updates More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\n\"South Korea could deal with this without limiting the movement of people because we knew the main source of infection, the church congregation, pretty early on,\" said Ki Mo-ran, an epidemiologist advising the government's coronavirus response. \"If we learned about it later than we did, things could have been far worse.\"\n\nSouth Koreans, unlike Europeans and Americans, were also primed to treat the coronavirus as a national emergency, after a 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in the country killed 38.\n\nThe coronavirus is thought to have a five-day incubation period, often followed by a period of mild symptoms that could be mistaken for a cold, when the virus is highly communicable. This pattern creates a lag of a week or two before an outbreak becomes apparent. What looks like a handful of cases can be hundreds; what looks like hundreds can be thousands.\n\n\"Such characteristics of the virus render the traditional response, which emphasizes lockdown and isolation, ineffective,\" said Kim Gang-lip, South Korea's vice health minister. \"Once it arrives, the old way is not effective in stopping the disease from spreading.\"\n\nLesson 2: Test Early, Often and Safely\n\nSouth Korea has tested far more people for the coronavirus than any other country, enabling it to isolate and treat many people soon after they are infected.\n\nThe country has conducted over 300,000 tests, for a per-capita rate more than 40 times that of the United States.\n\n\"Testing is central because that leads to early detection, it minimizes further spread and it quickly treats those found with the virus,\" Kang Kyung-wha, South Korea's foreign minister, told the BBC, calling the tests \"the key behind our very low fatality rate as well.\"\n\nThough South Korea is sometimes portrayed as having averted an epidemic, thousands of people were infected and the government was initially accused of complacency. Its approach to testing was designed to turn back an outbreak already underway.\n\nTo spare hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed, officials opened 600 testing centers designed to screen as many people as possible, as quickly as possible -- and keep health workers safe by minimizing contact.\n\nAt 50 drive-through stations, patients are tested without leaving their cars. They are given a questionnaire, a remote temperature scan and a throat swab. The process takes about 10 minutes. Test results are usually back within hours.\n\nAt some walk-in centers, patients enter a chamber resembling a transparent phone booth. Health workers administer throat swabs using thick rubber gloves built into the chamber's walls.\n\nRelentless public messaging urges South Koreans to seek testing if they or someone they know develop symptoms. Visitors from abroad are required to download a smartphone app that guides them through self-checks for symptoms.\n\nOffices, hotels and other large buildings often use thermal image cameras to identify people with fevers. Many restaurants check customers' temperatures before accepting them.\n\nLesson 3: Contact Tracing, Isolation and Surveillance\n\nWhen someone tests positive, health workers retrace the patient's recent movements to find, test -- and, if necessary, isolate -- anyone the person may have had contact with, a process known as contact tracing.\n\nThis allows health workers to identify networks of possible transmission early, carving the virus out of society like a surgeon removing a cancer.\n\nSouth Korea developed tools and practices for aggressive contact tracing during the MERS outbreak. Health officials would retrace patients' movements using security camera footage, credit card records, even GPS data from their cars and cellphones.\n\n\"We did our epidemiological investigations like police detectives,\" Dr. Ki said. \"Later, we had laws revised to prioritize social security over individual privacy at times of infectious disease crises.\"\n\nAs the coronavirus outbreak grew too big to track patients so intensively, officials relied more on mass messaging.\n\nSouth Koreans' cellphones vibrate with emergency alerts whenever new cases are discovered in their districts. Websites and smartphone apps detail hour-by-hour, sometimes minute-by-minute, timelines of infected people's travel -- which buses they took, when and where they got on and off, even whether they were wearing masks.\n\nPeople who believe they may have crossed paths with a patient are urged to report to testing centers.\n\nSouth Koreans have broadly accepted the loss of privacy as a necessary trade-off.\n\nPeople ordered into self-quarantine must download another app, which alerts officials if a patient ventures out of isolation. Fines for violations can reach $2,500.\n\nBy identifying and treating infections early, and segregating mild cases to special centers, South Korea has kept hospitals clear for the most serious patients. Its case fatality rate is just over one percent, among the lowest in the world.\n\nLesson 4: Enlist The Public's Help\n\nThere aren't enough health workers or body-temperature scanners to track everybody, so everyday people must pitch in.\n\nLeaders concluded that subduing the outbreak required keeping citizens fully informed and asking for their cooperation, said Mr. Kim, the vice health minister.\n\nTelevision broadcasts, subway station announcements and smartphone alerts provide endless reminders to wear face masks, pointers on social distancing and the day's transmission data.\n\nThe messaging instills a near-wartime sense of common purpose. Polls show majority approval for the government's efforts, with confidence high, panic low and scant hoarding.\n\n\"This public trust has resulted in a very high level of civic awareness and voluntary cooperation that strengthens our collective effort,\" Lee Tae-ho, the vice minister of foreign affairs, told reporters earlier this month.\n\nOfficials also credit the country's nationalized health care system, which guarantees most care, andspecial rules covering coronavirus-related costs, as giving even people with no symptoms greater incentive to get tested.\n\nIs The Korean Model Transferable?\n\nFor all the attention to South Korea's successes, its methods and containment tools are not prohibitively complex or expensive.\n\nSome of the technology the country has used is as simple as specialized rubber gloves and cotton swabs. Of the seven countries with worse outbreaks than South Korea's, five are richer.\n\nExperts cite three major hurdles to following South Korea's lead, none related to cost or technology.\n\nOne is political will. Many governments have hesitated to impose onerous measures in the absence of a crisis-level outbreak.\n\nAnother is public will. Social trust is higher in South Korea than in many other countries, particularly Western democracies beset by polarization and populist backlash.\n\nBut time poses the greatest challenge. It may be \"too late,\" Dr. Ki said, for countries deep into epidemics to control outbreaks as quickly or efficiently as South Korea has.\n\nChina turned back the catastrophic first outbreak in Hubei, a province larger than most European countries, though at the cost of shutting down its economy.\n\nSouth Korea's methods could help the United States, though \"we probably lost the chance to have an outcome like South Korea,\" Mr. Gottlieb, the former F.D.A. commissioner, wrote on Twitter. \"We must do everything to avert the tragic suffering being borne by Italy.\"\n\nMax Fisher reported from
