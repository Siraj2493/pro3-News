Several surveys conducted last month estimated that 40 percent of renters in New York City, if not more, would not make April rent, which was due on Wednesday.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York New York has only six days' worth of ventilators left. Javits center beds will be used for virus patients, Cuomo says. N.Y.C. officials said residents should cover their faces outside. See more updates Updated 7h ago More live coverage: Global Markets\n\nThe trickle-down effect could be swift and devastating, according to landlords, leaving them scrambling to find ways to pay their own bills, such as water, sewer and taxes at their buildings.\n\nIt is too soon to get an accurate gauge of how many renters withheld their April rent and what the fallout would be for landlords.\n\nBut Mr. Salerno said in an interview on Thursday that he did not care about losing his rental income in April, nor did he care to calculate the amount that he would not be collecting from his 80 apartments. He said he had about 200 to 300 tenants in total.\n\nHe is likely forgoing hundreds of thousands of dollars in income by canceling April rent.\n\nHis only interest, he said, was in alleviating stress for his renters, even those who were still employed and now working from home.\n\n\"My concern is everyone's health,\" said Mr. Salerno, 59, whose rent gesture was first reported by the local news site Greenpointers.com. \"I told them just to look out for your neighbor and make sure that everyone has food on their table.\"\n\nMr. Salerno said a handful of his tenants messaged him last month saying that they could not afford rent. Three renters from Ireland packed up a few belongings and moved back home, he said.\n\nWhen Mr. Gentile spotted the sign last week, he said he was surprised but not shocked. For the nearly four years Mr. Gentile has lived in the apartment, Mr. Salerno has been a model landlord.\n\nEmergencies are fixed almost immediately, he said, such as a water leak in Mr. Gentile's ceiling that was fixed, patched and painted within several hours.\n\n\"You don't see that, especially in a landlord-tenant relationship in New York City,\" Mr. Gentile, 28, said. \"He's amazing.\"\n\nAs New York City started to shut down in mid-March, Mr. Gentile quickly lost his job. He was a lawyer for a personal injury firm who spent most of his time in courthouses, all of which were closed on March 18. There was little work for him outside the courtroom.\n\nThe law firm's partners told him that they hope to rehire him when the economy rebounds, he said. But without a job and rent almost due, Mr. Gentile spent the end of March stressing about using his savings for bills, including what he and his fianc\u00e9e had reserved for their wedding in November.\n\n\"It has alleviated a huge amount of stress that I have been having with the unemployment system in the state,\" he said, adding that he had called the New York State Department of Labor roughly 240 times over two days in March to finally connect with a person to file for benefits.\n\nFor decades, Mr. Salerno has been a larger-than-life character in his part of Williamsburg, on the other side of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway from the ritzy high-rises near the East River. During the day, he runs the Salerno Auto Body Shop and gasoline station, which his father opened in 1959.\n\nIn the 1980s, Mr. Salerno started to buy vacant lots across Brooklyn to store cars damaged in accidents before they were repaired. In the late 1990s, he started to turn 18 of the lots into apartment buildings.\n\nThe repair shop and station are both open, though gasoline sales are down about half from a month ago, he said. He would prefer not to be working on people's cars during the pandemic, but wanted to be there for his customers.\n\n\"Do I really want to do a simple oil change and a brake job?\" Mr. Salerno said on the phone at the auto shop on Thursday. \"No, but I have a lot of doctors and nurses who need their cars serviced.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

"title": "Opinion | Putting Jared Kushner In Charge Is Utter Madness", "body": "Trump's son-in-law has no business running the coronavirus response.\n\nReporting on the White House's herky-jerky coronavirus response, Vanity Fair's Gabriel Sherman has a quotation from Jared Kushner that should make all Americans, and particularly all New Yorkers, dizzy with terror.\n\nAccording to Sherman, when New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, said that the state would need 30,000 ventilators at the apex of the coronavirus outbreak, Kushner decided that Cuomo was being alarmist. \"I have all this data about I.C.U. capacity,\" Kushner reportedly said. \"I'm doing my own projections, and I've gotten a lot smarter about this. New York doesn't need all the ventilators.\" (Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top expert on infectious diseases, has said he trusts Cuomo's estimate.)\n\nEven now, it's hard to believe that someone with as little expertise as Kushner could be so arrogant, but he said something similar on Thursday, when he made his debut at the White House's daily coronavirus briefing: \"People who have requests for different products and supplies, a lot of them are doing it based on projections which are not the realistic projections.\"\n\nKushner has succeeded at exactly three things in his life. He was born to the right parents, married well and learned how to influence his father-in-law. Most of his other endeavors -- his biggest real estate deal, his foray into newspaper ownership, his attempt to broker a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians -- have been failures.\n\nUndeterred, he has now arrogated to himself a major role in fighting the epochal health crisis that's brought America to its knees. \"Behind the scenes, Kushner takes charge of coronavirus response,\" said a Politico headline on Wednesday. This is dilettantism raised to the level of sociopathy.\n\nThe journalist Andrea Bernstein looked closely at Kushner's business record for her recent book \"American Oligarchs: The Kushners, the Trumps, and the Marriage of Money and Power,\" speaking to people on all sides of his real estate deals as well as those who worked with him at The New York Observer, the weekly newspaper he bought in 2006.\n\nKushner, Bernstein told me, \"really sees himself as a disrupter.\" Again and again, she said, people who'd dealt with Kushner told her that whatever he did, he \"believed he could do it better than anybody else, and he had supreme confidence in his own abilities and his own judgment even when he didn't know what he was talking about.\"\n\nIt's hard to overstate the extent to which this confidence is unearned. Kushner was a reportedly mediocre student whose billionaire father appears to have bought him a place at Harvard. Taking over the family real estate company after his father was sent to prison, Kushner paid $1.8 billion -- a record, at the time -- for a Manhattan skyscraper at the very top of the real estate market in 2007. The debt from that project became a crushing burden for the family business. (Kushner was able to restructure the debt in 2011, and in 2018 the project was bailed out by a Canadian asset management company with links to the government of Qatar.) He gutted the once-great New York Observer, then made a failed attempt to create a national network of local politics websites.\n\nHis forays into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- for which he boasted of reading a whole 25 books -- have left the dream of a two-state solution on life support. Michael Koplow of the centrist Israel Policy Forum described Kushner's plan for the Palestinian economy as \"the Monty Python version of Israeli-Palestinian peace.\"\n\nDebatable: Agree to disagree, or disagree better? Broaden your perspective with sharp arguments on the most pressing issues of the week.\n\nNow, in our hour of existential horror, Kushner is making life-or-death decisions for all Americans, showing all the wisdom we've come to expect from him.\n\n\"Mr. Kushner's early involvement with dealing with the virus was in advising the president that the media's coverage exaggerated the threat,\" reported The Times. It was apparently at Kushner's urging that Trump announced, falsely, that Google was about to launch a website that would link Americans with coronavirus testing. (As The Atlantic reported, a health insurance company co-founded by Kushner's brother -- which Kushner once owned a stake in -- tried to build such a site, before the project was \"suddenly and mysteriously scrapped.\")\n\nThe president was reportedly furious over the website debacle, but Kushner's authority hasn't been curbed. Politico reported that Kushner, \"alongside a kitchen cabinet of outside experts including his former roommate and a suite of McKinsey consultants, has taken charge of the most important challenges facing the federal government,\" including the production and distribution of medical supplies and the expansion of testing. Kushner has embedded his own people in the Federal Emergency Management Agency; a senior official described them to The Times as \"a 'frat party' that descended from a U.F.O. and invaded the federal government.\"\n\nDisaster response requires discipline and adherence to a clear chain of command, not the move-fast-and-break-things approach of start-up culture. Even if Kushner \"were the most competent person in the world, which he clearly isn't, introducing these kind of competing power centers into a crisis response structure is a guaranteed problem,\" Jeremy Konyndyk, a former U.S.A.I.D. official who helped manage the response to the Ebola crisis during Barack Obama's administration, told me. \"So you could have Trump and Kushner and Pence and the governors all be the smartest people in the room, but if there are multiple competing power centers trying to drive this response, it's still going to be chaos.\"\n\nCompeting power centers are a motif of this administration, and its approach to the pandemic is no exception. As The Washington Post reported, Kushner's team added \"another layer of confusion and conflicting signals within the White House's disjointed response to the crisis.\" Nor does his operation appear to be internally coherent. \"Projects are so decentralized that one team often has little idea what others are doing -- outside of that they all report up to Kushner,\" reported Politico.\n\nOn Thursday, Governor Cuomo said that New York would run out of ventilators in six days. Perhaps Kushner's projections were incorrect. \"I don't think the federal government is in a position to provide ventilators to the extent the nation may need them,\" Cuomo said. \"Assume you are on your own in life.\" If not in life, certainly in this administration.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

halted travel for most Americans, but people in Florida, the Southeast and other places that waited to enact such orders have continued to travel widely, potentially exposing more people as the coronavirus outbreak accelerates, according to an analysis of cellphone location data by The New York Times.\n\nThe divide in travel patterns, based on anonymous cellphone data from 15 million people, suggests that Americans in wide swaths of the West, Northeast and Midwest have complied with orders from state and local officials to stay home. Disease experts who reviewed the results say those reductions in travel -- to less than a mile a day, on average, from about five miles -- may be enough to sharply curb the spread of the coronavirus in those regions, at least for now.\n\n\"That's huge,\" said Aaron A. King, a University of Michigan professor who studies the ecology of infectious disease. \"By any measure this is a massive change in behavior, and if we can make a similar reduction in the number of contacts we make, every indication is that we can defeat this epidemic.\"\n\nBut not everybody has been staying home.\n\nIn areas where public officials have resisted or delayed stay-at-home orders, people changed their habits far less. Though travel distances in those places have fallen drastically, last week they were still typically more than three times those in areas that had imposed lockdown orders, the analysis shows.\n\nA half-dozen of the most populous counties where residents were traveling widely last week are in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis resisted calling for a statewide lockdown until Wednesday. People in Jacksonville, Tampa, Daytona Beach, Lakeland and surrounding areas continued to travel much more than people in other parts of the country, putting those areas at a higher risk for outbreaks in the coming weeks.\n\nIn Jacksonville, the sheriff's department had to send out officers over the weekend to break up block parties. In Spartanburg, S.C., people were still going to the hardware store to buy supplies for home-improvement projects, and pictures from children's birthday parties and playdates were being posted on Facebook. And along the shorelines in Florida and Alabama, communities that rely on tourists to help drive the economy instead looked with frustration at out-of-state license plates on the street.\n\n\"I saw people this weekend shaking hands with each other,\" Lenny Curry, the mayor of Jacksonville, Florida's largest city, told residents. \"I understand, maybe it's just habit. But we've got to stop, folks. We've really got to stop this.\"\n\nThe location data, from Cuebiq, a data intelligence firm, measures the range that people travel each day. It cannot predict where outbreaks will spread, and it does not track how many interactions people had while they were traveling. Not all travel is problematic: A person driving for a few miles to pick up groceries would not be violating stay-at-home orders. And people in cities can infect others without traveling far.\n\nBut broadly higher levels of travel suggest more contact with others and more chances to spread or contract the disease, researchers said. Counties with lax travel policies risk not only becoming the next hot spots of the disease, but also acting as reservoirs for the virus that reignite infection in places that have tamped it down, they said.\n\nFlorida waited so long to shut down travel that it will struggle to control local outbreaks even if people immediately change their behavior significantly, said Thomas Hladish, an infectious disease modeler at the University of Florida. People who now sequester themselves at home still risk having brought the virus home to their families, he said.\n\n\"A lockdown order right now is not going to be a silver bullet with containing this,\" Mr. Hladish said. \"It will absolutely save lives. But in order to really have a big effect with social-distancing measures, you would have had to move it back in time.\"\n\nIn Spartanburg, a city of 37,000 people in the northeast part of South Carolina, the City Council this week delayed putting into place any official order. \"I'd like to see us wait at least another couple of weeks for this discussion,\" one councilwoman, Ruth Littlejohn, said.\n\nErica Brown, another councilwoman in Spartanburg, has pushed for enacting limits, saying they were necessary because issuing simple cautions had not worked. \"They're going about their days as if nothing has changed,\" she said of residents.\n\nMs. Brown acknowledged that the city -- which has undergone an economic rebirth in recent years -- and particularly locally owned businesses, would surely suffer by keeping people home. But she said she feared that waiting any longer may mean devastation down the line.\n\n\"Now everyone is just trying to crawl their way back to the starting line,\" she said, \"and we're already behind in our response.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina issued an order closing businesses deemed nonessential, including entertainment venues, bingo halls, gyms and salons.\n\nOther areas reduced travel weeks ago, the data show, especially in California, New York and Washington, which were the first to experience large outbreaks. Most people have essentially stopped traveling in those places for weeks, the data show, a sign that they are taking the measures seriously. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said on Tuesday that changes in behavior were already bringing down the level of new cases in those places.\n\nDisease experts said that a tenfold reduction in travel in many counties in the United States gave them hope that other places could have similar success, as long as the reductions remain in effect for an extended period and are implemented nationwide.\n\nBut even states and cities that were relatively early in setting restrictions did not significantly reduce travel until mid- to late March, leaving a path for the virus to make its way around the country. Control measures typically take two to three weeks to show an effect because of the time it takes for infected people to develop symptoms, seek medical care and get tested.\n\nIn New Orleans, where more than 2,000 people have been infected, travel was not reduced significantly until March 20, weeks after Mardi Gras brought huge crowds together. In Albany, Ga., a town of 75,000, travel reductions in recent weeks were too late to stop a cluster of illnesses that apparently emerged after a funeral in late February. Travel started declining only about two weeks ago in Indianapolis, Chicago, Miami and Phoenix, leaving room for continued growth last month.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak is unprecedented in scale in recent history, and it is hard to know the exact relationship between changes in travel patterns and how quickly the virus spreads. Other factors play a big role, including how quickly sick people are tested and isolated, how closely people tend to congregate -- and luck.\n\nSheltering in place is protective and clearly reduces people's contact with others, but the existing evidence that the policy can effectively contain an epidemic within a large population is uncertain, experts said.\n\n\"It's unprecedented, an extraordinarily disruptive natural experiment like this,\" Mr. Hladish said. \"We have to look back to the influenza pandemic of 1918 for anything similar, and then of course the field of epidemiology was less well-developed, and we had nothing like the technology we do now.\"\n\nWorking on the fly, scientists are assessing the results of different containment policies and their timing day by day -- and using those findings to advise regions that are not yet overwhelmed.\n\nLast week, Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama resisted issuing a stay-at-home order as the outbreak appeared more acute and immediate in other states. \"We are not California,\" she said. \"We're not New York. We aren't even Louisiana.\" But as the number of cases rose, she encouraged residents to limit social gatherings and ordered the closure of nonessential businesses. \"These are uncertain times, for sure,\" she said in a televised speech \"So now, and for the foreseeable future, please, please consider staying safe at home.\"\n\nThe inconsistencies in policies -- and in when they are imposed -- may create new problems, even for places that set limits weeks ago.\n\n\"Let's assume that we flatten the curve, that we push transmission down in the Bay Area and we walk away with 1 percent immunity,\" said Dr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Then, people visit from regions that have not sheltered in place, and we have another run of cases. This is going to happen.\"\n\nEven in Florida, where limits were announced on Wednesday, weeks after other places enacted them, some residents said their biggest worry was not locals, but visitors from other places.\n\nThis week, before the limits came into effect, Quanita J. May, a city commissioner in Daytona Beach, said her area was exceptionally quiet. Along the beaches and downtown, she said, \"It feels like it's Christmas or Thanksgiving, the three or four days when everybody is at home with their families.\"\n\n\"The residents are self-quarantining,\" she said, adding that her real concern was people coming from other places. They were the ones, she said, who were not staying put. \"People are listening to the newscasts, they're reading, and they're paying attention,\" she said. \"This is here now.\"", "source": {"uri":

Updates: Economic Picture Darkens as Detected Infections Approach One Million", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\n\u65b0\u51a0\u75c5\u6bd2\u75ab\u60c5\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\n\nHere's what you need to know:New infections surge, and economic outlook darkens.Labor Department report is expected to show millions more jobless.Venturing outside in Spain, but only to join the unemployment line.Almost every New Yorker knows someone who is sick.America is divided by disparate distancing measures.Britain, struggling to test health care workers, vows to scale up efforts.Panama enforces quarantine regulations by gender.New infections surge, and economic outlook darkens.\n\nAs global coronavirus numbers approached one million detected infections and 50,000 deaths, the measures taken have yet to slow the pace of the pathogen's spread in most countries.\n\nBut the economic and social consequences of closing down global business grew by the day.\n\nWhole sectors of the economy have been battered, and millions of people have lost their jobs. There is no precedent for the current fiscal challenge, and economic forecasts increasingly pointed to a deeper and longer lasting slump than previously imagined.\n\nThe threat to public health is also growing more acute.\n\nFrom Florida, which joined other states telling people to stay at home, to Panama, where men and women were told to go out in public on alternating days, governments increased restrictions on the movement of people.\n\nThe United States leads the world in total cases, and an increasingly somber sounding President Trump said that he was considering steps once thought unimaginable, like banning some domestic flights.\n\n\"I am looking where flights are going into hot spots,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday evening. \"Closing up every single flight on every single airline, that's a very, very, very rough decision. But we are thinking about hot spots where you go from spot to spot, both hot. And we'll let you know fairly soon.\"\n\nThe hottest spot in America remained the New York region.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 926,000 people in at least 171 countries.\n\nNearly 2,400 people have died in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- half the national total. More than 1,300 of those deaths were in New York City.\n\nGov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that 12,000 Covid-19 patients hospitalized across New York State and more than 3,000 in intensive care, but that the health care system, while stretched, had not yet reached capacity.\n\nHe added, however, that he expected the state to reach that moment in seven to 21 days, though exactly when was, \"the $64,000 question.\"\n\nWith supplies dwindling, there might not be enough ventilators or other critical equipment, leaving doctors in New York to wrestle with the kind of agonizing choices confronting health care workers daily in Italy and Spain.\n\nThe U.S. government has nearly emptied its emergency stockpile of protective medical supplies like masks, gowns and gloves, a senior official said. Some states receiving desperately needed ventilators discovered that the machines did not work.\n\nLabor Department report is expected to show millions more jobless.\n\nAnother jaw-dropping number is expected in the United States on Thursday when the government reports the number of new unemployment claims filed across the country last week.\n\nSeveral estimates put the figure at roughly five million. That would come on top of the 3.3 million claims reported last week -- a total that could be revised upward when the Labor Department issues its report at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.\n\nThe speed and scale of the job losses is without precedent. Until the coronavirus outbreak caused widespread workplace shutdowns and layoffs, the previous record for initial unemployment filings was 695,000 in 1982.\n\nThe economic damage from the pandemic was initially concentrated in tourism, hospitality and related industries. But now the pain is spreading. The Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday that the manufacturing sector, which had recently begun to recover from last year's trade war, was contracting again. Data from the employment site ZipRecruiter shows a steep drop in job postings even in industries that are usually insulated from recessions, like education and health care.\n\nVenturing outside in Spain, but only to join the unemployment line.\n\nFor weeks, people in Spain have been ordered to remain in their homes unless they had an urgent reason for going outside. But outside a social security office in the Raval neighborhood of Barcelona on Thursday, hundreds of people said they had no choice but to join the line.\n\n\"I have one week left of savings to buy food for my family,\" said Mafus Rohman, 33, who said he had opened a bar a week before Spain went into lockdown on March 14.\n\nMr. Rohman said if the owner of his apartment had not frozen the rent, he would have been on the streets with his wife and their 5-year-old twins. \"I don't have anything else but a huge loan to reimburse,\" he said.\n\nSimilar scenes played out across the country, where more than 10,000 deaths have been reported. On Thursday, the country recorded its highest daily toll: 950 dead.\n\nThe unemployment numbers released on Thursday suggest that the impact on Spain's work force could be greater than that of the 2008 financial crisis. Over 800,000 workers withdrew from the Spanish social security system in March, the highest monthly drop in modern history.\n\n\"The conscious decision not to take measures to protect production is leading us to a crisis without precedent,\" said Daniel Lacalle, an economist who is forecasting that Spanish unemployment could reach 35 percent, up from 14 percent before the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nMyrna Mosca, a 42-year-old housekeeper, waited in line with two friends for food credits. Ms. Mosca said her two employers had asked her to stop coming. \"We've all been thrown into the unknown,\" she said. \"All of us.\"\n\nAlmost every New Yorker knows someone who is sick.\n\nNew Yorkers have watched in helpless fear as the coronavirus, with dizzying speed and ferocity, truly took hold of the city in recent days. With almost 1,400 dead, many have already lost someone in their circle -- a co-worker, an old friend from high school, the parent of a child's classmate. The parish priest, the elderly neighbor upstairs. A mother, a father.\n\nThe story is told in the numbers: There were 47,349 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections in New York City as of Wednesday. But the reality of its reach is far worse -- one study of cases in China suggested that up to 10 times the people who have tested positive may be infected, which would make the true number in the city close to half a million. And the apex is believed to still be weeks away.\n\nThe rising numbers have conversely shrunk the private worlds of some 8 million individual people. It is as if the microscopic enemy, once an abstract nuisance to many, something happening someplace else, seemed to be closing in, its arrival announced with the now-constant peal of the ambulance siren.\n\nIf the pandemic can be thought of as playing out in weeks -- the week the restaurants closed, the week schools closed, stores closed -- this has been the week its true grip was felt throughout the city.\n\n\"It is the great equalizer,\" said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday at a briefing. \"I don't care how smart, how rich, how powerful you think you are. I don't care how young, how old.\"\n\nAmerica is divided by disparate distancing measures.\n\nStay-at-home orders have nearly halted travel for most Americans, but people in Florida, the Southeast and other places that waited to enact such orders have continued to travel widely, potentially exposing more people as the coronavirus outbreak accelerates, according to an analysis of cellphone location data by The New York Times.\n\nWhere America Didn't Stay Home Even as the Virus Spread\n\nPeople in Florida and elsewhere continued to travel widely last week, potentially exposing more people to the coronavirus, phone data shows.\n\nThe divide in travel patterns, based on anonymous cellphone data from 15 million people, suggests that Americans in wide swaths of the West, Northeast and Midwest have complied with orders from state and local officials to stay home. Disease experts who reviewed the results say those reductions in travel -- to less than a mile a day, on average, from about five miles -- may be enough to sharply curb the spread of the coronavirus in those regions, at least for now.\n\nBritain, struggling to test health care workers, vows to scale up efforts.\n\nAs Britons planned to once again take to their balconies and gardens on Thursday to salute the National Health Service, the news that only 2,000 medical workers had been tested for the virus drew widespread outrage, underscoring the country's struggles to ramp up its capabilities even as the death toll mounts.\n\nBritain reported 563 deaths on Wednesday, the highest daily tally to date, raising the national toll to 2,352.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in isolation after contracting the virus, sent a video message to the nation Wednesday evening that appeared to have been recorded on a cellphone.\n\nHe said the country would be \"massively increasing testing.\"\n\n\"This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle,\" he said. \"This is how we will defeat it in the end.\"\n\nMany have compared the limited response in Britain to Germany, where testing is widespread and the death rate is relatively low.\n\nChris Hopson, the chief executive of N.H.S. Providers, which represents hospitals in the National Health Service, told the BBC's Radio 4 program Today that just 2,000 front-line health care workers had been tested for the virus and that Britain had the capacity to process only about 13,000 tests per day.\n\nHe cited shortages in swabs and the reagent needed to process the tests, and said in a statement posted to Twitter that testing capacity was \"so constrained\" that hospitals were asked to allocate only 15 percent of tests to staff.\n\nThe shortages have been a chronic global challenge as governments and health care providers scramble to obtain diagnostic kits, with major disparities in testing capacity. Much of Western Europe has found itself short of kits, and governors across the United States pleaded with the federal government for help in bolstering their own testing capacity.\n\nPanama enforces quarantine regulations by gender.\n\nThink of it as the world's strictest ladies' night.\n\nThe authorities in Panama, alarmed by widespread violations of its quarantine rules, have announced new restrictions, dependent on gender. Under rules that will be in place for the first 15 days of April, men and women will have separate days that they are permitted to leave their homes.\n\nWomen will be allowed outdoors on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Men will have Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Everyone is required to stay home on Sunday. The new rules will help the authorities keep tighter control over who is on the streets.\n\n\"The large number of people circulating outside their homes, despite the mandatory national quarantine, has led the national government to take more severe measures to protect the health of the population,\" a government statement said.\n\nThe time of day one can go out was already limited by personal identification or passport number. If the last number on your ID is 7, you can go out between 6:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. For the number 8, the window is 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. The final window is 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. for the number 6. People over 60 have a special time slot between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.\n\nBetween March 19 and March 31, 5,339 people were arrested after violating the quarantine regulations, the Ministry of Public Security said.\n\nAs of Wednesday, Panama reported 1,317 confirmed coronavirus cases and 32 deaths.\n\nWith New Jersey city under siege, emergency workers race to keep up.\n\nA few weeks ago, a 911 call for \"respiratory distress\" would have sent emergency medical technicians -- E.M.T.s -- rushing into the building to examine the person and take vitals. Now with coronavirus infections sweeping through the region, the emergency medical workers of Paterson, a poor, industrial city in the penumbra of pandemic-stricken New York, are working in a new, upside-down reality: Don't go in a home, don't touch the patient and don't take anyone to the hospital, unless absolutely necessary.\n\nDay and night, ambulances crisscross the streets of Paterson, the eerie silence of a once-raucous city shredded by siren shrieks so pervasive it sounds as if the city is under attack.\n\nWhich, in a sense, it is.\n\nWith colossal public housing projects and families crammed into sagging, multiunit homes, Paterson is a densely populated city of nearly 148,000. These days, the city's ambulance call volume, per capita, is as great as New York City's, asserted Brian J. McDermott, the exhausted chief of the Fire Department.\n\nThere were 576 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in Paterson as of late Wednesday afternoon, a number constantly rising. The emergency department at St. Joseph's University Medical Center in Paterson is being hammered with patients; the 650-bed hospital, currently handling about 100 Covid-19 cases, is searching for outside locations for more beds. Despite the efforts of the E.M.T.s to keep moderately ill people at home, nearly 80 percent of ambulance calls for suspected coronavirus have been serious enough to require transportation to the hospital.\n\nThe Paterson Fire Department allowed New York Times journalists to accompany a 12-hour shift of E.M.T. crews outfitted specifically to respond to potential Covid-19 cases. The grueling day offered a glimpse into the chaotic, risk-filled lives of emergency workers who are reaching directly into the jaws of the pandemic.\n\nIn Greece, migrant cases raise fears for the vulnerable.\n\nAs the virus spreads across the world, reaching into every community, fears in Europe are growing that a major outbreak could erupt in makeshift camps that house thousands of migrants.\n\nThe Greek authorities on Thursday quarantined residents of a state facility for refugees after 20 people there tested positive for the coronavirus. Officials conducted tests after a woman at the facility in Ritsona, which hosts around 2,600 people, tested positive for the virus after giving birth at a hospital in Athens.\n\nIt was the confirmed coronavirus infection among the tens of thousands of migrants living in camps across Greece. Residents will now be restricted to the area for two weeks while access to health workers will be limited.\n\nRestrictions were imposed last month on migrant camps on the Aegean Islands, notably the Moria facility on Lesbos, which has around 20,000 people, 10 times its intended capacity. Notis Mitarakis, the Greek migration minister, told Greek radio on Thursday that migrants would be segregated in the event of an outbreak.\n\nMigrants on the Greek islands are particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus, as they live in cramped conditions with little sanitation, and medical charities have called for their evacuation.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said it had divided its tiny clinic in the Moria camp into two sections, one for those suspected of carrying the virus and one for general health needs. The German aid organization Mission Lifeline, which has worked extensively in the camps, has urged the governments of Germany and Greece to allow refugees to be evacuated to Berlin.\n\nOther European nations have introduced measures to extend protections to migrants amid the outbreak. The government in Portugal temporarily extended residency status to migrants and asylum seekers in the country so that they can gain access to state resources and support. Ireland has put digital protections in place to ensure migrants accessing government support will have their status protected.\n\nAmid fears that the pandemic could lead to civil unrest, Americans buy nearly 2 million guns.\n\nAmericans bought 1.9 million guns in March, according to a Times analysis of federal data. It was the second-busiest month ever for gun sales, trailing only January 2013, just after President Barack Obama's re-election and the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\nWith some people fearful that the pandemic could lead to civil unrest, gun sales have been skyrocketing. In the past, fear of gun-buying restrictions has been a main driver of spikes in gun sales, far surpassing the effects of mass shootings and terrorist attacks. But last month was different. As they prepare for an uncertain future, Americans have been crowding grocery stores to stock up on household essentials like canned beans and toilet paper. A similar worry appears to be behind gun sales.\n\nIn recent weeks, lines have been snaking out of gun stores throughout the country. In many states, estimated sales doubled in March compared with February. In Utah, they nearly tripled. And in Michigan, which has become a hot spot for virus cases, sales more than tripled.\n\nThe run on firearms has raised public health concerns and prompted local officials to debate whether gun stores should be temporarily closed. Advocates for stricter safety measures argue that the surge in purchases could pose a safety threat if buyers aren't trained properly, new guns aren't stored safely and background checks aren't completed.\n\nBut after lobbying from the firearm industry, the Trump administration said this week that the stores qualified as essential businesses and should stay open during the lockdown alongside pharmacies, gas stations and grocery stores.\n\nBiden calls for Democratic convention to be delayed.\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday night called for moving the Democratic National Convention from mid-July to August, making him the most prominent member of his party to say the convention must be rescheduled because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"I doubt whether the Democratic convention is going to be able to be held in mid-July, early July,\" Mr. Biden told Jimmy Fallon on \"The Tonight Show.\" \"I think it's going to have to move into August.\"\n\nMr. Fallon had not asked Mr. Biden about the convention's timing. The former vice president was responding to a question about how the virus would affect the election.\n\nKatie Peters, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Convention Committee, said after Mr. Biden's remarks that she expected the committee to reveal more details about changes to convention plans by the end of this week.\n\nHow to tweak your home to serve you better now\n\nYour home is currently serving as a work space, living space and possibly a school and playground. It wasn't designed for all these disparate tasks, but there are things you can do to make your home more comfortable for you and your family in these times.\n\nIsraeli prime minister leaves, then re-enters, quarantine.\n\nNo sooner had Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ventured out of quarantine, than he was back in on Thursday, as the country and its high officials scrambled to keep up with the spread of the coronavirus, particularly among the country's ultra-Orthodox population.\n\nMr. Netanyahu was supposed to have ended a three-day period of self-isolation on Wednesday night after an aide, Rivka Paluch, his adviser on parliamentary and ultra-Orthodox affairs, was found to have contracted the virus.\n\nBut overnight Israel's health minister, Yaakov Litzman, tested positive, as did his wife. That sent Mr. Netanyahu back into quarantine until April 8, according to a statement from his office. It added that the period of quarantine was in line with Ministry of Health guidelines, which mandates 14 days of isolation, to be calculated from the last day of contact with an infected person. Mr. Netanyahu has already tested negative twice.\n\nIsrael has more than 6,000 known cases and at least 32 deaths. Israelis are on lockdown, other than for essential work or errands.\n\nIn a televised address on Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu said restrictions would be tightened on movement to and from Bnei Brak, a largely ultra-Orthodox suburb of Tel Aviv, where the rate of infection has raised alarms. The police set up roadblocks in the town on Thursday and questioned drivers.\n\nMr. Netanyahu has looked a bit worn down in his recent television appearances, but explained that he had to do his own hair and makeup.\n\nThe U.S. military faces competing missions: prepare for war or fight the coronavirus?\n\nMore than 1,200 U.S. military personnel and their family members are affected by coronavirus, leaving the Defense Department virtually at war with itself over two competing instincts: protecting troops from the virus and continuing its decades-old mission of patrolling the globe and engaging in combat, if ordered to do so.\n\nThe Navy is thus far refusing to completely evacuate an aircraft carrier where 93 service members have been confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper has put himself on the side of business as usual in maintaining readiness while also saying that force protection is a top priority. President Trump, for his part, threatened a familiar foe, tweeting on Wednesday that Iran would \"pay a very heavy price\" if its proxies attacked American troops or assets in Iraq. Other Defense Department officials continued to insist that the aircraft carrier, the Theodore Roosevelt, remain ready to carry out its missions.\n\nThe commander of the Roosevelt, Capt. Brett E. Crozier, pointed out in a strongly worded letter that \"we are not at war.\" That statement raised questions from the Pacific to the Pentagon of what was so important about the aircraft carrier's presence off the coast of Guam that the Defense Department could not evacuate the ship and do a deep cleaning, as suggested by Captain Crozier.\n\nU.S. warships typically spend months at sea monitoring the activities of adversaries. The ships assigned to the Pacific Fleet patrol the South China Sea, the East China Sea and areas in between, sometimes undertaking so-called freedom of navigation operations that bring them close to disputed islands in the area. The goal of these voyages is to drive home to China that the United States does not recognize Beijing's claims of ownership.\n\nAmerican warships in the region are also keeping an eye on the nuclear and missile threat from North Korea. And they sit ready to deploy to the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf if tensions -- with, say, Iran -- flare up.\n\nBut for the moment, the virus has proved far more damaging than any recent encounters with traditional adversaries and exposed a vulnerability of a force often referred to as the world's policeman. For all the focus on the battles in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and the power conflict with China and Russia, none has come close to crippling an American aircraft carrier in days.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Wednesday it would send 540 additional troops to the Southwest border to counter any potential flow of migrants who are infected with the coronavirus.\n\nLt. Gen. Laura Richardson of the military's Northern Command told reporters on Wednesday that the deployment would be happening \"very soon.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Megan Specia, Marc Santora, Damien

"The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\n\u65b0\u51a0\u75c5\u6bd2\u75ab\u60c5\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\n\nHere's what you need to know:In just two weeks, 10 million jobs have vanished, shaking the foundations of the global economy. Pelosi is forming a bipartisan House panel to monitor relief efforts and the administration's response.The U.S. approved a test that could help detect immunity.New York could deplete its ventilator stockpile in 6 days.The Democrats are postponing their convention until August.France is converting part of a food market into a morgue.Trump lashes out at New York political leaders.In just two weeks, 10 million jobs have vanished, shaking the foundations of the global economy.\n\nWhen the first cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States just over a month ago, President Trump mostly dismissed the looming threat, Wall Street chugged ever upward and people set about their business with scant recognition of the calamity that lay ahead.\n\nOn Thursday, the stunning scope of the economic disaster became clearer as the Labor Department reported the loss of 10 million jobs in just two weeks. Wall Street has seemingly imploded, and the global economy has shuddered as the fallout of the pandemic reaches into every country.\n\nHopes for a dramatic but brief downturn followed by a quick recovery have faded, and in their place are fears that the world may be on the cusp of an economic shock unseen since the Great Depression.\n\nThe speed and scale of the job losses is without precedent. Until last month, the worst week for unemployment filings was 695,000 in 1982.\n\nDespite the news that 6.6 million people had filed for unemployment benefits last week, the S&P 500 rose after Mr. Trump said he expected Russia and Saudi Arabia to announce oil production cuts, lifting energy stocks. Oil prices had been hammered as the pandemic all but eliminated travel and demand for energy, and a price war between Saudi and Russia had intensified the decline.\n\nBy shuttering businesses and forcing vast layoffs, the virus outbreak has in two weeks wiped out more jobs than the worst months of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe impact has been global.\n\nAlmost one million Britons have applied for welfare payments in the space of two weeks. Austria has its highest unemployment rate since the end of World War II. Millions of French workers have applied for some form of subsidy even as the government embarks on an ambitious plan to keep businesses from going under.\n\nThe unemployment rate in Norway jumped to 10.4 percent from 2.3 percent at the beginning of March, and more than 800,000 Spanish workers lost their jobs in March, the highest monthly drop in modern history.\n\nPelosi is forming a bipartisan House panel to monitor relief efforts and the administration's response.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she would form a bipartisan House committee to oversee the Trump administration's response to the pandemic and the implementation of the more than $2 trillion in government relief provided to confront the crisis.\n\nRepresentative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the majority whip, will lead the committee, which will have subpoena power, meaning it will have authority to demand testimony and documents from Mr. Trump's team about all aspects of their handling of the virus.\n\nMs. Pelosi said the panel would play a vital role in overseeing the largest government stimulus in modern American history.\n\n\"The committee will be acting before the fact to prevent a lot of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Ms. Pelosi said, adding that she planned to reach out to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to discuss keeping tabs on the stimulus measure and the trillions of dollars in federal money that will be dispersed across the country.\n\n\"There are things that are so new, and the rest, and we want to make sure there are not exploiters out there,\" she said, adding \"where there's money, there's frequently mischief.\" It is not clear how successful such a committee would be in extracting answers from the Trump administration about the broader virus response.\n\n\"The committee will be empowered to examine all aspects of the federal response to the coronavirus to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being wisely and efficiently spent to save lives, deliver relief and benefit our economy,\" Ms. Pelosi wrote in a letter to Democrats on Thursday.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly described his handling of the pandemic as exemplary, even though it has been plagued by missteps, including equipment shortages and a failure to test people early on that cost the government a crucial month it could have spent working to contain the virus. He has a long record of blocking efforts by Congress to oversee his administration, and in signing the stimulus measure, Mr. Trump suggested that he would have control over what information an inspector general overseeing the $500 billion corporate bailout fund would have to share with lawmakers.\n\nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, told reporters on Thursday that an oversight committee was unnecessary, saying it \"seems really redundant.\"\n\nThe U.S. approved a test that could help detect immunity.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the first test for coronavirus antibodies for use in the United States.\n\nCurrently available tests are designed to find fragments of viral DNA indicating an ongoing infection. An antibody test, on the other hand, tells doctors whether a patient has ever been exposed to the virus -- and, having recovered, now may have at least some immunity.\n\nThat is important for several reasons. People with immunity might be able to venture safely from their homes and help shore up the work force. It may be particularly important for doctors and nurses to know whether they have antibodies.\n\nAntibody testing eventually should give scientists a better sense of how widespread the infection is in the population and help researchers calculate more precisely the fatality rate and the frequency of asymptomatic infections.\n\nAntibody tests already are used in China, Singapore and a handful of other countries. Public Health England has purchased millions of antibody tests and hopes to make them available for home use in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe new test, made by Cellex Inc., looks for two types of antibodies: immunoglobulin M, made a few days into the course of infection; and immunoglobulin G, made even later but designed specifically to neutralize a particular invader.\n\nBut just having antibodies does not guarantee immunity from the coronavirus. Some people who are infected produce powerful immune responses; others do not. And scientists do not know how long immunity to this virus may last.\n\nAlthough the new test is approved for diagnosis, antibody tests are not likely to be positive in the early days of infection. New evidence suggests that people are most contagious two to three days before the onset of symptoms.\n\nTraditional PCR tests, with swabbing of the nose and throat, are more likely to detect a recent coronavirus infection.\n\nNew York could deplete its ventilator stockpile in 6 days.\n\nNew York State, whose 2,373 coronavirus deaths have made it the center of America's outbreak, is in danger of depleting its stockpile of critically needed ventilators in just six days, a somber-sounding Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Thursday.\n\n\"If a person comes in and needs a ventilator and you don't have a ventilator, the person dies,\" Mr. Cuomo said. \"That's the blunt equation here. And right now we have a burn rate that would suggest we have about six days in the stockpile.\"\n\nThe lack of ventilators, which are needed for patients who are incapable of breathing on their own, is emerging as one of the biggest looming dangers of the pandemic. Mr. Cuomo said that the state had sent 400 ventilators from its stockpile on Wednesday night to hard-hit hospitals in New York City and another 200 to hospitals in Long Island and Westchester.\n\nThat left just 2,200 ventilators in the state's stockpile, he said -- and led state officials to fear that if their projections hold, they will run through them in six days. The state has 92,381 confirmed cases, of whom 13,383 have been hospitalized, 3,396 in intensive care,\n\nMr. Cuomo said that buying more ventilators was proving difficult with so much competition from around the nation, and the world. So he said that hospitals were taking extraordinary measures to get the most out of their existing ventilators, including ending elective surgeries, using the ventilators on anesthesia machines and other devices, and splitting ventilators by connecting two patients to machines that are intended for one.\n\n\"It's not easy, it's not ideal, but it's better than nothing,\" he said.\n\nAnd Mr. Cuomo questioned how much help the federal government could provide at this point.\n\n\"I don't think the federal government is in a position to provide ventilators to the extent the nation may need them,\" he said. \"Just assume you are on your own in life.\"\n\nHe did say, however, that \"I'm sure the federal government would do anything they can do to help.\"\n\nWith supplies dwindling as demand grows, the lack of ventilators is leaving doctors in New York to wrestle with the kind of agonizing choices confronting health care workers daily in Italy and Spain: Who gets one?\n\nThe U.S. government has nearly emptied its emergency stockpile of protective medical supplies like masks, gowns and gloves, a senior official said. Some states receiving desperately needed ventilators from the federal government discovered that the machines did not work.\n\nMr. Cuomo -- who noted that, unlike the president, he cannot invoke the Defense Production Act to compel private industry to make critically-needed supplies -- made a plea, and an offer, to businesses.\n\nHe said that the state would pay to help manufacturers switch over to the production of needed hospital gowns, gloves and other equipment.\n\n\"If you have the capacity to make these products, we will purchase them, and we will pay a premium,\" he said. \"But we need it, like, now.\"\n\nThe virus hit home for Mr. Cuomo this week when his younger brother, Chris Cuomo, the CNN anchor, tested positive. The two brothers spoke by video during the governor's daily briefing.\n\n\"It's very tough,\" the younger Mr. Cuomo said. Then he gently teased his older brother, the governor: \"You look like you've been cutting your own hair.\"\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 981,000 people in at least 171 countries.\n\nThe Democrats are postponing their convention until August.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee on Thursday postponed the party's national convention because of the coronavirus, moving it from mid-July to mid-August. It is the largest political event to be moved so far because of the pandemic, which has already led to the cancellation of hundreds of state and local conventions from both parties.\n\nThe convention will still be held in Milwaukee, as planned, the week of Aug. 17, officials said, a week before Republicans plan to gather in Charlotte, N.C., to re-nominate Mr. Trump.\n\nThe delay comes just hours after the party's likely nominee, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., called for rescheduling the convention during an appearance on \"The Tonight Show.\"\n\nFrance is converting part of a food market into a morgue.\n\nIn a grim sign of the epidemic's growing toll in France, the police said on Thursday that a hall at the world's largest wholesale food market, near Paris, would be turned into a temporary morgue.\n\nMore than 5,300 people have died because of the epidemic in France, and the Paris region has been among the hardest-hit areas.\n\nThe police cited \"persistent tensions\" between hospitals and funeral homes as deaths accelerated. They said coffins would be placed temporarily in the refrigerated hall, which is \"offset and isolated\" from the rest of the food market, a sprawling 573-acre complex in Rungis.\n\n\"This location will make it possible to preserve, in conditions that are the most dignified and acceptable from a sanitary standpoint, the caskets of the deceased awaiting burial or cremation, in France or abroad,\" the police said.\n\nThe morgue is expected to start operating on Friday.\n\nIt was not the first time that the French authorities have used Rungis for a dire health crisis. In 2003, when a brutal heat wave killed thousands of elderly people, 700 bodies were kept in a refrigerated warehouse at the same site.\n\nTrump lashes out at New York political leaders.\n\nMr. Trump, under fire for his administration's failure to respond quickly to the pandemic, lashed out at New York again on Thursday, saying the state's doctors and hospitals are \"never satisfied\" with the medical supplies provided by the federal government because of politics.\n\nEven as a new report showed that millions of Americans have been forced from their jobs by the pandemic, Mr. Trump spent the morning attacking Senator Chuck Schumer and other New York politicians, accusing them of failing to adequately prepare the state's medical system for a serious outbreak.\n\nIn fact, officials in New York, which has become the center of the crisis, have repeatedly said that the federal government needed to do more to provide ventilators, masks and other protective gear to overwhelmed hospitals.\n\nGovernors around the country have criticized Mr. Trump for not doing more to centralize the provision of medical equipment. And public health officials have said that the administration's failure to provide adequate testing in late January and February allowed the virus to spread silently throughout the country.\n\nCritics have also said Mr. Trump should have done more to encourage governors to issue stay-at-home orders in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida ordered restrictions on Wednesday, having resisted doing so for days.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, the president defended his administration's efforts to send ventilators and protective equipment to New York, saying that \"other states are thrilled with the job we have done\" and insisting that \"the complainers should have been stocked up and ready long before this crisis hit.\"\n\nMr. Trump took particular aim at Mr. Schumer, the Senate's Democratic leader, who had criticized the federal response during an appearance on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program earlier in the morning.\n\nMr. Schumer called on the president to appoint a czar to oversee the provision of supplies and said that Mr. Trump had failed to confront the crisis aggressively enough.\n\n\"Look, the president was way behind the eight ball in so much of this,\" Mr. Schumer said. \"He didn't see the need. We were way behind in testing.\"\n\nIn his tweet, Mr. Trump shot back: \"somebody please explain to Cryin' Chuck Schumer that we do have a military man in charge of distributing goods, a very talented Admiral.\"\n\nThe president also suggested again -- without evidence -- that needed supplies were somehow going missing or being hoarded at New York hospitals, adding: \"stop complaining & find out where all of these supplies are going.\"\n\nThe president's complaints about New York are an escalation of a weekslong clash with officials from the state where he grew up, including Mr. Cuomo. But even as he attacked New York's response, Mr. Trump finished one of his tweets with praise for the governor: \"Cuomo working hard.\"\n\nMr. Cuomo, who was asked to respond to Mr. Trump's comments claiming that New York had gotten off to a \"late start\" but praising him personally, said, \"I don't know how you square those two statements, I don't know that you can square those two statements.\" He added that New York had been working agressively from the start.\n\nThe president's broadside came as New Yorkers have watched in helpless fear as the virus, with dizzying speed and ferocity, took hold of the city in recent days.\n\nWith more than 2,000 dead, many have already lost someone in their circle. There were 47,349 confirmed cases of infections in New York City as of Wednesday, and their rising numbers have conversely shrunk the private worlds of some 8 million people.\n\nGovernments are cracking down on people defying stay-at-home orders.\n\nAt least 38 states have announced plans for stay-at-home orders that will last for weeks, and governments are now trying to close businesses deemed nonessential that have stayed open.\n\nThe arts-and-crafts chain Hobby Lobby drew a rebuke on Wednesday from Colorado officials, who said the retailer was must comply with stay-at-home orders and immediately close its stores.\n\nIn a cease-and-desist letter to the company, W. Eric Kuhn, the senior assistant state attorney general, wrote that Hobby Lobby's reopening of stores violated an order by the governor that compelled all businesses to close unless state officials had classified them as critical.\n\n\"For the avoidance of doubt, Hobby Lobby is not a 'critical business,'\" Mr. Kuhn wrote.\n\nOhio's attorney general, Dave Yost, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that he had sent a similar letter to Hobby Lobby and that the retailer, which did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday night, had agreed to close stores in his state.\n\nOther businesses, including small companies, have also tried to remain open, earning the ire of the authorities from coast to coast.\n\nIn Los Angeles, where the city attorney said last week that prosecutors would \"work toward gaining compliance,\" at least eight businesses have been cited for operating in defiance of government orders.\n\n\"This is serious, and we cannot allow violations to continue,\" Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said at a news conference on Wednesday, when he said that city officials would shut off power and water to nonessential businesses that remained open after being warned.\n\n\"No one wants to take this step, and we won't have to as long as you follow the rules,\" Mr. Garcetti said.\n\nThe authorities have also said that individuals who breach shelter-in-place orders could be punished, like in Maryland, where violators could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $5,000, and Newark, where officials have issued hundreds of summonses.\n\n\"If you are doing people's hair and you're not supposed to, if you're opening up your store and you're not supposed to, if you're hanging out on the corner and you infect other people, these things can turn into very serious charges for you,\" said Mayor Ras J. Baraka said. \"Some people think we're doing too much, but there's a lot of people who think we're not doing enough.\"\n\nIn Georgia, where a statewide stay-at-home order is expected to take effect on Friday, Gov. Brian Kemp said that the state patrol was prepared to deal with people who ignored orders from state and local governments.\n\n\"The reality is that if you do not comply, you are violating the law, and you can face stiff penalties,\" Mr. Kemp said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that he was considering steps once thought unimaginable, like banning some domestic flights.\n\n\"I am looking where flights are going into hot spots,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Closing up every single flight on every single airline, that's a very, very, very rough decision. But we are thinking about hot spots where you go from spot to spot, both hot. And we'll let you know fairly soon.\"\n\nIn Panama, men and women are being told to go out in public on alternating days.\n\nThe Seattle-area nursing home linked to dozens of deaths faces steep fines over its handling of the outbreak.\n\nA nursing home linked to dozens of coronavirus deaths in the Seattle area faces a fine of more than $600,000 after federal inspectors found a range of problems in how the facility handled the outbreak.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a letter on Wednesday to the company, Life Care Center of Kirkland, that it may be terminated from Medicare and Medicaid participation if the facility is unable to come into compliance with federal regulations by September. Officials levied a fine of $13,585 per day covering a span of six weeks.\n\nFederal officials reported last month that Life Care had failed to notify state officials about the increasing rate of respiratory infections among residents, failed to rapidly identify and manage ill residents and failed to have a backup plan after the facility's primary clinician fell ill. C.M.S. said those urgent issues have since been resolved, but that Life Care will also need to demonstrate compliance on other issues, including record-keeping and its handling of safety and quality strategies.\n\n\"If L.C.C. of Kirkland does not correct all deficiencies and return to full compliance by September 16, 2020, then C.M.S. will terminate your facility from participating in the Medicare/Medicaid program,\" wrote Patrick Thrift, a C.M.S. enforcement official in Seattle.\n\nCellphone data shows where social distancing measures worked, and what happened in their absence.\n\nThere are still a dozen states where governors have resisted issuing stay-at-home orders to try to slow the spread of the virus, though localities in some of them have put their own bans in place. An analysis of cellphone location data by The New York Times found that people in the Southeast and other places that waited to enact such orders have continued to travel widely, potentially exposing more people as the outbreak accelerates.\n\nA half-dozen of the most populous counties where residents were still traveling widely last week are in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis did not call for a statewide lockdown until Wednesday. See where America did not stay at home:\n\nWhere America Didn't Stay Home Even as the Virus Spread\n\nPeople in Florida and elsewhere continued to travel widely last week, potentially exposing more people to the coronavirus, phone data shows.\n\nThe F.D.A. is relaxing blood donation guidelines for gay men and other groups.\n\nFacing a drastic drop in the national blood supply amid the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that it was reducing the amount of time men who have had sex with men should wait before they give blood, from one year to three months.\n\nThe earlier 12-month waiting period was intensely criticized as discriminatory and antiquated when the F.D.A. introduced it in 2015, as the agency formally ended a decades-old, lifetime prohibition on blood donations from gay and bisexual men. L.G.B.T.Q. advocates applauded the F.D.A.'s move on Thursday, but said they would work to lift the waiting period entirely.\n\nThe F.D.A. said that based on recent studies, it had \"concluded that current policies regarding certain donor eligibility criteria can be modified without compromising the safety of the blood supply.\"\n\nThe agency said the new recommendations would remain in place after the pandemic ends.\n\nBritain, struggling to test health care workers, vows to scale up efforts.\n\nAs Britons planned to once again take to their balconies and gardens on Thursday to salute the National Health Service, the news that only 2,000 medical workers had been tested for the virus drew widespread outrage, underscoring the country's struggles to ramp up its capabilities even as the death toll mounts.\n\nBritain reported 569 deaths on Thursday, the highest daily tally to date, raising the national toll to 2,921.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in isolation after contracting the virus, sent a video message to the nation Wednesday evening that appeared to have been recorded on a cellphone. He pledged \"massively increasing testing.\"\n\n\"This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle,\" he said. \"This is how we will defeat it in the end.\"\n\nMany have compared the limited response in Britain to Germany, where testing is widespread and the death rate is relatively low.\n\nChris Hopson, the chief executive of N.H.S. Providers, which represents hospitals in the National Health Service, told the BBC's Radio 4 program Today that just 2,000 front-line health care workers had been tested for the virus and that Britain had the capacity to process only about 13,000 tests per day.\n\nHe cited shortages in swabs and the reagent needed to process the tests, and said in a statement posted to Twitter that testing capacity was \"so constrained\" that hospitals were asked to allocate only 15 percent of tests to staff.\n\nThe shortages have been a chronic global challenge as governments and health care providers scramble to obtain diagnostic kits, with major disparities in testing capacity. Much of Western Europe has found itself short of kits, and governors across the United States pleaded with the federal government for help in bolstering their own testing capacity.\n\nWith Paterson, N.J., under siege, emergency workers are racing to keep up.\n\nFor the ambulance crews of Paterson, N.J., a poor, industrial city in the penumbra of pandemic-stricken New York, the outbreak is posing a test like no other. When the Paterson Fire Department allowed New York Times journalists to accompany a 12-hour shift of E.M.T. crews outfitted to respond to potential Covid-19 cases, it offered a glimpse into the chaotic, risk-filled lives of emergency workers who are reaching directly into the jaws of the pandemic.\n\n\"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'd almost rather go to a fire call,\" said Brian Hirschmanner, a firefighter and E.M.T. \"At least you can see what you're fighting. And it eventually goes out.\"\n\nIn Greece, migrant cases raise fears for the vulnerable.\n\nAs the virus spreads across the world, reaching into every community, fears in Europe are growing that a major outbreak could erupt in makeshift camps that house thousands of migrants.\n\nThe Greek authorities on Thursday quarantined residents of a state facility for refugees after 20 people there tested positive for the virus. Officials conducted tests after a woman at the facility in Ritsona, which hosts around 2,600 people, tested positive for the virus after giving birth at a hospital in Athens.\n\nIt was the confirmed infection among the tens of thousands of migrants living in camps across Greece. Residents will now be restricted to the area for two weeks while access to health workers will be limited.\n\nRestrictions were imposed last month on migrant camps on the Aegean Islands, notably the Moria facility on Lesbos, which has around 20,000 people, 10 times its intended capacity. Notis Mitarakis, the Greek migration minister, told Greek radio on Thursday that migrants would be segregated in the event of an outbreak.\n\nMigrants on the Greek islands are particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus, as they live in cramped conditions with little sanitation, and medical charities have called for their evacuation.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said it had divided its tiny clinic in the Moria camp into two sections, one for those suspected of carrying the virus and one for general health needs. The German aid organization Mission Lifeline, which has worked extensively in the camps, has urged the governments of Germany and Greece to allow refugees to be evacuated to Berlin.\n\nOther European nations have introduced measures to extend protections to migrants amid the outbreak. The government in Portugal temporarily extended residency status to migrants and asylum seekers in the country so that they can gain access to state resources and support. Ireland has put digital protections in place to ensure migrants accessing government support will have their status protected.\n\nHere's how to tweak your home to serve you better now.\n\nYour home is currently serving as a work space, living space and possibly a school and playground. It wasn't designed for all these disparate tasks, but there are things you can do to make your home more comfortable for you and your family in these times.\n\nThe face mask debate rages on as cities, like L.A., take their own measures.\n\nAmong the many questions raised amid the pandemic is whether healthy people should wear a mask when they're outside.\n\nWhile masks were a common sight across East Asia long before the outbreak -- worn for a variety of reasons -- the official advice from both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been that only the sick or their caregivers should wear masks. But those guidelines may be shifting, and some local officials are moving to get in front of a rule change.\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles urged residents on Wednesday to use face coverings when in public.\n\nSebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, wrote on Twitter on Monday that masks would be handed out at supermarket entrances, and that it was mandatory for shoppers to wear them.\n\nCovering the nose and mouth in public has been required in the Czech Republic since last month. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis, addressed Mr. Trump on Twitter on Sunday, asking the American leader to follow the Czech example.\n\nThe president of Slovakia, who made waves on social media last month for wearing fashionable face masks that matched her clothes on official engagements, has also made facial protection in public mandatory. Officials in Jena, a city in eastern Germany, said on Monday that protective masks should be worn inside shops and on local transport, among other places.\n\nAnd in Boston, officials on Thursday awaited the New England Patriots' team jet, which was hauling 1.2 million masks to the Northeast for use in Massachusetts and New York.\n\nReporting was contributed by Michael Cooper, Alan Blinder, Karen Zraick, Reid J.

Often the parents of American-born children, they have lived for years with the cloud of deportation hanging over their households.\n\nThe \"essential work\" letters that many now carry are not a free pass from immigration authorities, who could still deport Ms. Silva and other undocumented field workers at any time.\n\nBut local law enforcement authorities said the letters might give immigrant workers a sense of security that they will not be arrested for violating stay-at-home orders.\n\n\"If you have people who perceive that they may be stopped and questioned or deported because of their status, under these circumstances, having that letter makes them feel comfortable,\" said Eric Buschow, a captain with the sheriff's office in Ventura County, where thousands of farmworkers labor in strawberry, lemon and avocado operations. \"They can go to work. And their work is essential now.\"\n\nThe pandemic has also put many of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's operations on hold. On March 18, the agency said it would \"temporarily adjust its enforcement posture\" to focus not on ordinary undocumented immigrants, but on those who pose a public safety or criminal threat.\n\nThe agency said it would not carry out enforcement actions near health care facilities \"except in the most extraordinary of circumstances\" and would instead focus its efforts on human trafficking, gangs and drug enforcement.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Shortages, stay-at-home orders and sobering economic predictions.

See more updates Updated 19m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\n\"Those of us without papers live in fear that immigration will pick us up,\" Ms. Silva said. \"Now we are feeling more relaxed.\"\n\nAcross the country, farmworkers have been struggling to understand what the coronavirus outbreak will mean for their safety and livelihoods. Even if they face a lower risk of deportation, many worry that the close working conditions in fields and packing facilities put them at risk for contracting the virus, and some warehouse workers are seeing their hours cut as employers adjust to the shifting market.\n\nFor many workers, the fact that they are now considered both illegal and essential is an irony that is not lost on them, nor is it for employers who have long had to navigate a legal thicket to maintain a work force in the fields.\n\n\"It's sad that it takes a health crisis like this to highlight the farmworkers' importance,\" said Hector Lujan, chief executive of Reiter Brothers, a large family-owned berry grower based in Oxnard, Calif., that also has operations in Florida and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nMr. Lujan, whose company employs thousands of field workers, described them as unsung heroes for guaranteeing that Americans have food security.\n\n\"Maybe one of the benefits of this crisis is that they are recognized and come out of the shadows,\" said Mr. Lujan, whose company has been lobbying Congress to pass a bill that would legalize immigrant farmworkers.\n\nAbout half of all crop hands in the United States, more than one million, are undocumented immigrants, according to the Agriculture Department. Growers and labor contractors estimate that the share is closer to 75 percent.\n\nDespite increased mechanization, the agriculture sector has continued to struggle with a dearth of labor because many fruits and vegetables must be harvested by hand to avoid bruising.\n\nIn a 2017 survey of farmers by the California Farm Bureau, 55 percent reported labor shortages, and the figure was nearly 70 percent for those who depend on seasonal workers. Wage increases in recent years have not compensated for the shortfall, growers said.\n\nStrawberry operations in California, apple orchards in Michigan and dairy farms in New York and Idaho are wrestling with a shrinking, aging work force, a crackdown at the border, and the failure of Congress to agree on an immigration overhaul that could provide a steady source of labor. A surge in deportations and the voluntary return of many Mexicans to their home country have aggravated the shortage.\n\nAs a result, growers increasingly have turned to a seasonal guest-worker program, officially known as the H-2A program, to fill gaps in their labor supply. The number of workers on the visa rocketed to 257,667 in fiscal 2019, compared with 48,336 workers in fiscal 2005.\n\nGrowers panicked after the State Department earlier this month paused all visa processing in Mexico during the public health emergency. In response to an outcry, the department announced on March 26 that it would waive in-person interviews, enabling most applications to be vetted in time for the peak harvest.\n\nAmerican agriculture is at a critical juncture, with a massive volume of produce to be harvested between now and August. In California, citrus fruit is still being plucked off the trees, strawberries are getting underway, and many other crops ripen in the summer. In Georgia, Vidalia onions and peaches will soon be mature. In Washington, apple trees are heavy with fruit in the summer.\n\nLetters notifying undocumented workers that they are \"essential,\" when they still officially face potential deportation, are sending the same mixed signals that have long been at the root of American agricultural labor policy, according to many who work closely with the process.\n\n\"Some people are really confused by the message. The government is telling them it needs them to go to work, but it hasn't halted deportations,\" said Reyna Lopez, executive director of P.C.U.N., a union representing agricultural workers in Woodburn, Ore.\n\nShe and other advocates said employers are not doing enough to educate their workers, who often do not speak English, about the coronavirus. \"When people don't understand the risks, they don't take necessary precautions,\" Ms. Lopez said.\n\nThe pandemic carries particular risks for agricultural workers. Most do not receive sick pay if they fall ill, and they lack health insurance. The $2 trillion pandemic aid package that passed Congress last week does not offer any assistance to undocumented immigrants.\n\nArmando Elenes, secretary-treasurer of the United Farm Workers, said that letters affirming that workers are \"essential\" do not substitute for \"meaningful steps to stem the pandemic by protecting farmworkers with basic actions.\" Those would include, he said, extending sick leave to 40 hours or more, making it easier for workers to claim sick days and providing more-aggressive disinfection of work areas.\n\nSome growers, like Reiter Brothers, have trained workers on how to stay healthy, including frequent hand washing and the proper techniques for coughing and sneezing. The company has increased the number of hand-washing stations in the fields and spaced out workers who are picking strawberries. The company also offers medical care.\n\nJim Cochrane, a grower of organic berries, artichokes, broccoli and other crops in Santa Cruz, Calif., told his workers that he would keep paying them if they contracted the virus and had to miss work, even for three weeks.\n\nBut such policies are exceptions, according to the United Farm Workers.\n\nAgricultural workers in packing warehouses and poultry plants, who often work in close quarters, are both fearful of getting the virus and worried about recent cutbacks that have threatened their ability to work.\n\nMaura Fabian, 48, packs grapes for schools and hospitals in a warehouse in the Central Valley near Fresno, where she said that about half the workers have been let go; the others, she said, including her, have had their hours drastically cut.\n\nSince March 16, Ms. Fabian has worked four-hour shifts most days, and been told not to report at all on other days.\n\nShe assumes that her employer has thinned the packing lines because, with schools closed, demand for packed fruit is down. The company is also trying to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among workers, she said.\n\n\"We're afraid of this illness. But we are more afraid that we won't be able to make a living,\" said Ms. Fabian, a single mother who bought a house in October, where she lives with her three children.\n\nIn Idaho, where on March 25 the governor implemented a statewide stay-at-home order, dairy owners are scrambling to ensure that the industry's 8,000 workers, 90 percent of them undocumented, can keep working. Even before the virus, the industry, which needs workers year-round to milk the cows, had been grappling with a labor shortfall.\n\nRick Naerebout, chief executive of the Idaho Dairymen's Association, said that he has fielded calls from many dairy farmers worried that their workers may be unable to get to work if the authorities begin enforcing domestic travel restrictions. So he has been providing members with a template to print out on official letterhead and distribute to workers, stating that they are now considered essential workers, part of the nation's critical infrastructure.\n\n\"The fact that there is that cognitive recognition that we have to allow these individuals to travel to and from work because they are critical -- that's the complete opposite of what they've heard for nearly their entire lives, that they have taken away opportunities from Americans,\" he said.\n\n\"At the highest level of government, now we've seen this be recognized. Whether it's formal or informal, there's this acknowledgment that, you're OK.\"\n\nCaitlin Dickerson in New York contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Why the Country's Coronavirus Death Rate Is Low", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThey call them corona taxis: Medics outfitted in protective gear, driving around the empty streets of Heidelberg to check on patients who are at home, five or six days into being sick with the coronavirus.\n\nThey take a blood test, looking for signs that a patient is about to go into a steep decline. They might suggest hospitalization, even to a patient who has only mild symptoms; the chances of surviving that decline are vastly improved by being in a hospital when it begins.\n\n\"There is this tipping point at the end of the first week,\" said Prof. Hans-Georg Kr\u00e4usslich, the head of virology at University Hospital in Heidelberg, one of the country's leading research hospitals. \"If you are a person whose lungs might fail, that's when you will start deteriorating.\"\n\nHeidelberg's corona taxis are only one initiative in one city. But they illustrate a level of engagement and a commitment of public resources in fighting the epidemic that help explain one of the most intriguing puzzles of the pandemic: Why is Germany's death rate so low?\n\nThe virus and the resulting disease, Covid-19, have hit Germany with force: According to Johns Hopkins University, the country had more than 90,000 laboratory-confirmed infections by Friday evening, more than any other country except the United States, Italy and Spain.\n\nBut with 1,275 deaths, Germany's fatality rate stood at 1.3 percent, compared with 12 percent in Italy, around 10 percent in Spain, France and Britain, 4 percent in China and 2.5 percent in the United States. Even South Korea, a model of flattening the curve, has a higher fatality rate, 1.7 percent.\n\n'We Take the Dead From Morning Till Night'\n\nNo country has been hit harder by the coronavirus than Italy, and no province has suffered as many losses as Bergamo. Photos and voices from there evoke a portrait of despair.\n\n\"There has been talk of a German anomaly,\" said Hendrik Streeck, director of the Institute of virology at the University Hospital Bonn. Professor Streeck has been getting calls from colleagues in the United States and elsewhere.\n\n\"'What are you doing differently?' they ask me,\" he said. \"Why is your death rate so low?\"\n\nThere are several answers to this question, experts say, a mix of statistical distortions and very real differences in how the country has taken on the epidemic.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak A day of mourning in China, amid doubts over its virus toll. C.D.C. says all Americans should wear masks. Trump says he won't. FEMA, racing to provide virus relief, is running short on front-line staff. See more updates Updated 40m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\nThe average age of those infected is lower in Germany than in many other countries. Many of the early patients caught the virus in Austrian and Italian ski resorts and were relatively young and healthy, Professor Kr\u00e4usslich said.\n\n\"It started as an epidemic of skiers,\" he said.\n\nAs infections have spread, more older people have been hit and the death rate, only 0.2 percent two weeks ago, has risen, too. But the average age of contracting the disease remains relatively low, at 49. In France, it is 62.5 and in Italy 62, according to their latest national reports.\n\nAnother explanation for the low fatality rate is that Germany has been testing far more people than most nations. That means it catches more people with few or no symptoms, increasing the number of known cases, but not the number of fatalities.\n\n\"That automatically lowers the death rate on paper,\" said Professor Kr\u00e4usslich.\n\nBut there are also significant medical factors that have kept the number of deaths in Germany relatively low, epidemiologists and virologists say, chief among them early and widespread testing and treatment, plenty of intensive care beds and a trusted government whose social distancing guidelines are widely observed.\n\nTesting\n\nIn mid-January, long before most Germans had given the virus much thought, Charit\u00e9 hospital in Berlin had already developed a test and posted the formula online.\n\nBy the time Germany recorded its first case of Covid-19 in February, laboratories across the country had built up a stock of test kits.\n\n\"The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,\" said Dr. Christian Drosten, chief virologist at Charit\u00e9, whose team developed the first test.\n\nBy now, Germany is conducting around 350,000 coronavirus tests a week, far more than any other European country. Early and widespread testing has allowed the authorities to slow the spread of the pandemic by isolating known cases while they are infectious. It has also enabled lifesaving treatment to be administered in a more timely way.\n\n\"When I have an early diagnosis and can treat patients early -- for example put them on a ventilator before they deteriorate -- the chance of survival is much higher,\" Professor Kr\u00e4usslich said.\n\nMedical staff, at particular risk of contracting and spreading the virus, are regularly tested. To streamline the procedure, some hospitals have started doing block tests, using the swabs of 10 employees, and following up with individual tests only if there is a positive result.\n\nAt the end of April, health authorities also plan to role out a large-scale antibody study, testing random samples of 100,000 people across Germany every week to gauge where immunity is building up.\n\nOne key to ensuring broad-based testing is that patients pay nothing for it, said Professor Streeck. This, he said, was one notable difference with the United States in the first several weeks of the outbreak. The coronavirus relief bill passed by Congress last month does provide for free testing.\n\n\"A young person with no health insurance and an itchy throat is unlikely to go to the doctor and therefore risks infecting more people,\" he said.\n\nTracking\n\nOn a Friday in late February, Professor Streeck received news that for the first time, a patient at his hospital in Bonn had tested positive for the coronavirus: A 22-year-old man who had no symptoms but whose employer -- a school -- had asked him to take a test after learning that he had taken part in a carnival event where someone else had tested positive.\n\nIn most countries, including the United States, testing is largely limited to the sickest patients, so the man probably would have been refused a test.\n\nNot in Germany. As soon as the test results were in, the school was shut, and all children and staff were ordered to stay at home with their families for two weeks. Some 235 people were tested.\n\n\"Testing and tracking is the strategy that was successful in South Korea and we have tried to learn from that,\" Professor Streeck said.\n\nGermany also learned from getting it wrong early on: The strategy of contact tracing should have been used even more aggressively, he said.\n\nAll those who had returned to Germany from Ischgl, an Austrian ski resort that had an outbreak, for example, should have been tracked down and tested, Professor Streeck said.\n\nA Robust Public Health Care System\n\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic swept across Germany, University Hospital in Giessen had 173 intensive care beds equipped with ventilators. In recent weeks, the hospital scrambled to create an additional 40 beds and increased the staff that was on standby to work in intensive care by as much as 50 percent.\n\n\"We have so much capacity now we are accepting patients from Italy, Spain and France,\" said Susanne Herold, a specialist in lung infections at the hospital who has overseen the restructuring. \"We are very strong in the intensive care area.\"\n\nAll across Germany, hospitals have expanded their intensive care capacities. And they started from a high level. In January, Germany had some 28,000 intensive care beds equipped with ventilators, or 34 per 100,000 people. By comparison, that rate is 12 in Italy and 7 in the Netherlands.\n\nBy now, there are 40,000 intensive care beds available in Germany.\n\nSome experts are cautiously optimistic that social distancing measures might be flattening the curve enough for Germany's health care system to weather the pandemic without producing a scarcity of lifesaving equipment like ventilators.\n\n\"It is important that we have guidelines for doctors on how to practice triage between patients if they have to,\" Professor Streeck said. \"But I hope we will never need to use them.\"\n\nThe time it takes for the number of infections to double has slowed to about eight days. If it slows a little more, to between 12 and 14 days, Professor Herold said, the models suggest that triage could be avoided.\n\n\"The curve is beginning to flatten,\" she said.\n\nTrust in Government\n\nBeyond mass testing and the preparedness of the health care system, many also see Chancellor Angela Merkel's leadership as one reason the fatality rate has been kept low.\n\nMs. Merkel has communicated clearly, calmly and regularly throughout the crisis, as she imposed ever-stricter social distancing measures on the country. The restrictions, which have been crucial to slowing the spread of the pandemic, met with little political opposition and are broadly followed.\n\nThe chancellor's approval ratings have soared.\n\n\"Maybe our biggest strength in Germany,\" said Professor Kr\u00e4usslich, \"is the rational decision-making at the highest level of government combined with the trust the government enjoys in the population.\"\n\nChristopher F.

"The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- The captain of an American aircraft carrier deployed to the Pacific Ocean has pleaded with the Pentagon for more help as a coronavirus outbreak aboard his ship continues to spread, officials said Tuesday. Military officials say dozens of sailors have been infected.\n\nIn a four-page letter, first reported by The San Francisco Chronicle Tuesday, Capt. Brett E. Crozier of the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt laid out the laid out the dire situation unfolding aboard the warship, with more than 4,000 crew members, and what he said were the Navy's failures to provide him with the proper resources to combat the virus by moving sailors off the vessel.\n\n\"We are not at war,\" Captain Crozier wrote. \"Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset -- our sailors.\"\n\nThe carrier is currently docked in Guam.\n\nThe crisis aboard the Roosevelt played out like a slow-moving disaster and highlights the dangers to the Pentagon if the coronavirus manages to infiltrate some its most important assets, such as bomber fleets, elite Special Operations units and the talisman of American military power, aircraft carriers.\n\nIn a statement, a Navy official said that the commanding officer of the Roosevelt \"alerted leadership in the Pacific Fleet on Sunday evening of continuing challenges in isolating the virus.\"\n\n\"The ship's commanding officer advocated for housing more members of the crew in facilities that allow for better isolation,\" the statement said. \"Navy leadership is moving quickly to take all necessary measures to ensure the health and safety of the crew of U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, and is pursuing options to address the concerns raised by the commanding officer.\"\n\nA senior Navy official on Sunday sought to play down the urgency of the situation on the Roosevelt, saying that while it was unfortunate, most of the reported symptoms at that point among the sickened sailors and other crew members had been mild.\n\nLast week, Thomas B. Modly, the acting Navy secretary, told reporters that three cases of the virus had been reported aboard the Roosevelt, marking the first time a U.S. Navy ship had announced a coronavirus infection at sea.\n\nFifteen days earlier, the ship made a port call in Da Nang, Vietnam.\n\nMr. Modly defended the ship's decision to dock in Vietnam despite the spread of the virus through Asia. He said that, at the time, coronavirus cases in Vietnam were less than 100 and located in the north of the country, around Hanoi. Port calls for U.S. Navy ships have since been canceled.\n\nMaj. Gen. Jeff Taliaferro, the vice director of operations with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged on Monday that there had been media reports about coronavirus aboard the Roosevelt. He declined to go into details for security reasons, he said.\n\nBut, echoing a line that the military has consistently taken during the course of the pandemic, General Taliaferro insisted that the Roosevelt can nonetheless perform its missions. If the Roosevelt, in Guam right now, had to sail immediately, General Taliaferro told reporters on a conference call, it was \"ready to sail.\"\n\nEric Schmitt contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_gibbons_neff@nytimes.com", "name": "Thomas Gibbons-Neff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Pacific_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Pacific Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Nang", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Da Nang"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Da Nang"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint Chiefs of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/31/us/politics/31dc-virus-military/31dc-virus-military-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5647002", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 65753, "pinterest": 12}, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 65765, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6021160849", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-05", "time": "16:20:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-05T16:20:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-05T16:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/magazine/navy-captain-crozier-positive-coronavirus.html", "title": "Navy Captain Removed From Carrier Tests Positive for Covid-19", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nCapt. Brett E. Crozier, the Navy captain who was removed from command of the coronavirus-stricken aircraft carrier U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, has tested positive for Covid-19, according to two Naval Academy classmates of Crozier's who are close to him and his family.\n\nA Navy spokesman declined to comment on Crozier's Covid status.\n\nThe commander began exhibiting symptoms before he was removed from the warship on Thursday, two of his classmates said. Crozier was fired following a leak to The San Francisco Chronicle of a letter he had emailed to Navy leaders that detailed the failures on the service's part to provide the necessary resources to swiftly move sailors off the carrier and disinfect areas on board as the virus spread through the ship.\n\nThomas B. Modly, the acting secretary of the Navy, said he had lost confidence in Crozier's ability to command the ship effectively as it dealt with the evolving crisis after Crozier sent the letter on an unclassified email system to 20 to 30 people. Sending such a letter, Modly said, caused unnecessary alarm about the operational readiness of the ship and undermined the chain of command. \"In sending it out pretty broadly, he did not take care to ensure that it couldn't be leaked,\" Modly said. \"And that's part of his responsibility.\"\n\nIn a briefing Saturday, President Trump offered support for Modly's decision. \"He shouldn't be talking that way in a letter,\" the president said of Crozier. \"I thought it was terrible what he did.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Mark T. Esper said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that there were 155 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among sailors aboard the aircraft carrier, and that more than half of the ship had been tested. So far there have been no hospitalizations.\n\n\"There is an investigation ongoing,\" Esper said of Crozier's actions. \"All the services at times relieve commanders without the benefit of an investigation up front because they've lost confidence in them. It's certainly not unique to the Navy.\"\n\nThe news of Crozier's diagnosis is likely to fuel further skepticism of the Navy's handling of the outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier, which has already received notable criticism from the rank and file. On Friday, videos circulated showing hundreds of sailors aboard the Roosevelt cheering for Crozier as he disembarked the ship. Memes depicting the Navy captain rescuing his sailors from a burning building over saving his own career sprouted up across social media.\n\nCrozier's firing has also raised concerns with Democratic lawmakers. In a statement, the Democratic leaders of the House Armed Services Committee condemned his removal, although they acknowledged that Crozier might have made missteps in his handling of the situation. \"Captain Crozier was justifiably concerned about the health and safety of his crew, but he did not handle the immense pressure appropriately,\" the lawmakers said. \"However, relieving him of his command is an overreaction.\"\n\n\"Throwing the commanding officer overboard without a thorough investigation is not going to solve the growing crisis aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt,\" the lawmakers added.\n\nOn Sunday, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. expressed criticism of the Navy's actions on ABC's \"This Week,\" saying, \"I think it's close to criminal the way they're dealing with this guy.\"\n\n\"I think he should have a commendation rather than be fired,\" Biden added.\n\nA Navy spokesman said that Crozier has been reassigned to the headquarters of the Naval Air Forces Pacific command in San Diego, but that he must complete a quarantine period first.\n\nThe captain was being quarantined in \"distinguished visitors quarters\" on Naval Base Guam, according to two of his classmates. It is unclear when he was first tested for Covid-19 or when he received his results.\n\nAll sailors who are evacuated from the Theodore Roosevelt must have a negative test result for Covid-19 before they can be quarantined ashore. At least 400 from the vessel were expected to be sent to hotels in Guam on Sunday, according to Mary Rhodes, the president of the Guam Hotel and Restaurant Association, who is helping the Navy with the logistics of these transfers. \"This is an emergent situation and a humanitarian effort,\" said Rhodes. \"We have 13 hotels to receive up to 4,000 military personnel.\"\n\nThe sailors will join roughly 625 other service members from the Roosevelt who have already tested negative for the virus and have been sent to quarantine in hotels over the past few days.\n\nEric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.\n\nJohn Ismay is a staff writer who covers armed conflict for The New York Times Magazine.

Now He Sits in Quarantine, Fired and Infected.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- For days, he fended off fears that the contagion would spread unchecked through his crew. Then last week, the captain of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, who had appealed to his superiors for help, was fired.\n\nBy Sunday, friends said, he had come down with the coronavirus himself.\n\nThe military has long adhered to a rigid chain of command and tolerated no dissent expressed outside official channels. Capt. Brett E. Crozier, the skipper of the aircraft carrier, knew he was up against those imperatives when he asked for help for nearly 5,000 crew members trapped in a petri dish of a warship in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nBut colleagues say the mistake that could cost Capt. Crozier his career was charging headlong into the Trump administration's narrative that it had everything under control.\n\nPentagon officials said that although President Trump never ordered Captain Crozier dismissed, he was displeased with the captain's actions and let the Navy know -- a sentiment Mr. Trump made very public on Saturday when he lashed out at the captain.\n\nEven so, the Navy's top brass clashed about what to do.\n\nAdm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, privately urged against dismissal and argued that, per usual Navy procedures, an investigation into what went wrong on the Roosevelt should be allowed to play out. But the acting Navy secretary, Thomas B. Modly, overruled the Navy's top admiral, saying Captain Crozier had cracked under pressure.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper said on Sunday that he supported Mr. Modly's decision. The Washington Post first reported the differing opinions among Navy officials.\n\nNavy officials acknowledged on Sunday that tensions between Captain Crozier and his immediate boss, Rear Adm. Stuart P. Baker, commander of a multiship task force including the Roosevelt, most likely complicated the Navy's response to the viral outbreak and prompted the captain to send a four-page letter pleading for help. Officials said the letter, sent as an unclassified email, went only to other Navy personnel, but it leaked to the news media last week.\n\nIndeed, the Navy hinted at such tensions in a statement on Sunday that the findings of the investigation into what happened aboard the Roosevelt and the chain of command in the Pacific, including its \"command climate,\" would be submitted to Admiral Gilday on Monday.\n\nAccording to those who have known Captain Crozier for more than three decades, the picture Mr. Modly paints of their friend and classmate is not one they recognize.\n\nJeff Craig, who recently retired from the Navy after serving as a captain, including a tour as second in command of the Roosevelt, worked extensively with Captain Crozier after attending the Naval Academy with him. Captain Crozier became a helicopter pilot, Mr. Craig said, earning a nickname that he retained even after he transitioned to flying jets and ultimately to commanding a carrier: Chopper.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak As hot spots shift in the U.S., Washington State shows how one place that is rebounding can help others. The U.S. is undercounting the number of people who have died in the pandemic, experts say. Queen Elizabeth II urges the British people to display resolve, even as Prime Minister Boris Johnson enters the hospital. See more updates Updated 4m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\n\"Chopper is one of the best people I have ever known, both professionally and personally,\" Mr. Craig, who now works with Amazon's air cargo division, said in an interview Sunday.\n\nOn Sunday, Captain Crozier was in quarantine in Guam, the American territory in the Pacific, dealing with a dry, raspy cough, say people who know him. At least 400 sailors from the Roosevelt who have tested negative for the virus are expected to be sent from the ship to hotels, joining 625 other sailors who have already tested negative for the virus.\n\nIt is not known when Captain Crozier's diagnosis was made, or whether the Navy was aware of his infection when he was removed from command, if the medical results came before his punishment.\n\nFriends and colleagues say Captain Crozier, 50, is at peace with a decision that likely ended a career that vaulted him from the United States Naval Academy to the prestigious job as captain of one of the Navy's 11 aircraft carriers.\n\nCaptain Crozier, a native of Santa Rosa, Calif., started his career flying helicopters. He was then accepted for an exceptionally rare transfer to fly fixed-wing jet aircraft, eventually rising to command an F/A-18 Hornet fighter squadron. From there, he began the nearly decade-long pipeline to command an aircraft carrier.\n\nCaptain Crozier entered the Navy's academically daunting nuclear power school to learn how to run the twin nuclear plants at the heart of a Nimitz-class carrier like the Theodore Roosevelt. Then, he served as the second in command of the carrier Ronald Reagan, and later as top officer of the Blue Ridge, an amphibious command ship, in Yokosuka, Japan.\n\nBut little had prepared the captain, who assumed command of the Roosevelt in November, and his crew for what happened in March.\n\nThe carrier was steaming in the western Pacific, ready to respond to any emergency involving North Korea, an emboldened Chinese navy in the South China Sea or other emerging crisis. On March 24, two weeks after pulling out of a port call in Da Nang, Vietnam, two sailors aboard Roosevelt tested positive for the coronavirus and were flown to Guam for treatment. Two days later, fearing the scourge of a fast-spreading virus aboard the aircraft carrier, with its cramped quarters for nearly 5,000 sailors, the ship steamed into a previously scheduled stop in Guam, which has a major Navy base and hospital.\n\nCaptain Crozier appealed to his superiors for help and Navy officials began responding, but that was not apparently enough.\n\nThe tipping point was a four-page letter dated March 30, first reported by The San Francisco Chronicle on Tuesday, in which Captain Crozier laid out the dire situation unfolding aboard the warship. He described what he said were the Navy's failures to provide him with the proper resources to combat the virus by moving sailors off the vessel.\n\n\"We are not at war,\" Captain Crozier wrote. \"Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset -- our sailors.\"\n\nBack at the Pentagon was a furious Mr. Modly, who had moved up from the Navy's No. 2 job in November after Mr. Esper demanded the resignation of his boss over his handling of the case of a Navy SEAL commando whom Mr. Trump had championed. The acting secretary told reporters last week that the Navy was rushing badly needed supplies to the Roosevelt well before the captain sent his letter to several officers in his chain of command over unclassified email. Mr. Modly said the captain had become \"overwhelmed\" by the crisis, and said he removed him over a loss of confidence -- and not retribution for the letter. Navy officials say they do not know who leaked the letter.\n\nBut in removing from command a captain who complained that the Navy was not doing enough to stop the spread of coronavirus, the Navy opened itself to criticism that it was insufficiently concerned about the health of its sailors. Even though Mr. Modly stressed that he welcomed blunt assessments from subordinate officers, the removal of Captain Crozier could have a chilling effect, several senior officers said.\n\nOnline, members of Captain Crozier's Naval Academy Class of 1992 have rallied behind their classmate. Members of the class, most of whom have long since left the military, say their private Facebook group is overflowing with posts and comments in support of the captain. \"The volume of posts was almost exponential,\" one classmate, Mark Roppolo, said in a telephone interview.\n\nMr. Craig, who served with Captain Crozier, said he sent his friend an email when the coronavirus started spreading in Asia this winter, wishing him well. He said he received a reply saying thank you, but has not spoken to him since he was relieved of command.\n\nThe two men were picked to the Navy's demanding nuclear power school together in 2012, and Captain Crozier clearly excelled.\n\n\"Nuclear power school is a crucible,\" Mr. Craig said. \"It's not for the faint of heart. Chopper would stay late, study on weekends, until he could not only pass the tests but had a deep understanding of the concepts behind them.\"\n\nMr. Craig said during his time onboard the Roosevelt in 2015, the command regularly drilled to react to battle damage, fire and other catastrophes, but never practiced what they would do if infectious disease ravaged the tight quarters of the ship.\n\n\"Chopper always had the best interests of his crew forefront. I'm sure that was the case here,\" Mr. Craig said. \"Chopper's character is not prone to hasty or uneducated decision making. Anything he did was well thought out.\"\n\nDan Goldenberg, another Naval Academy classmate of Captain Crozier's, said that \"Modly is wrong no matter what.\"\n\n\"He either made the wrong call in firing Crozier, or if he made the right call, he did a terrible job of explaining it -- it's just illogical,\" said Mr. Goldenberg, a retired Navy captain and special assistant to four secretaries of the Navy.\n\nOn Sunday, friends say, Captain Crozier found himself sitting alone in the \"distinguished visitors quarters\" on Naval Base Guam, battling a coronavirus infection, with an unknown next step in a nearly 30-year military career.\n\nThe evacuation Captain Crozier sought for his crew is now in motion -- one following the rousing send-off they gave him as he left the ship last week.\n\nHundreds of sailors who tested negative have been evacuated from the ship, which is being disinfected with a skeleton crew aboard to operate the nuclear reactors and other critical functions.\n\nQuarantined sailors are not allowed to leave their rooms. Their meals are placed on the floor outside their hotel doors three times a day, and alcohol and outside food are not allowed in.\n\nThese sailors have not even been given keys to their rooms. If they try sneaking out, the doors will lock behind them and they will need a military police officer -- one of whom is keeping watch on every floor -- to let them back in. They do have access to Wi-Fi and cable television, and are allowed to smoke on their balconies, if their room has one.\n\nTwice a day, hospital corpsmen -- the Navy's medics -- visit each room and take the sailors' temperatures, to watch for potential fevers.\n\nIt is not an ending any of Captain Crozier's friends and academy classmates envisioned.\n\n\"Can you imagine devoting your whole life to the Navy as Crozier has, and you make the right call to help your crew, and this happens?\" Mr. Goldenberg said. \"I'm floored.\"\n\nDave Philipps contributed reporting from Colorado Springs.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_schmitt@nytimes.com", "name": "Eric Schmitt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command hierarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(naval)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (naval)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Theodore Roosevelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_M._Gilday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael M.

the chairman of the Theodore Roosevelt Institute at Long Island University.\n\nOn Monday, Capt. Brett Crozier, the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, sent a letter to the Navy pleading for permission to unload his crew, including scores of sailors sickened with Covid-19, in Guam, where it was docked. The Pentagon had been dragging its feet, and the situation on the ship was growing dire.\n\n\"We are not at war,\" he wrote. \"Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset -- our sailors.\"\n\nAfter the letter was leaked to The San Francisco Chronicle, the Navy relented. But on Thursday, it relieved Captain Crozier of his command.\n\nCaptain Crozier joins a growing list of heroic men and women who have risked their careers over the last few weeks to speak out about life-threatening failures to treat the victims of this terrible pandemic. Many of them are doctors and nurses, and many of them, like Captain Crozier, have been punished. All of them deserve our deepest gratitude.\n\nIn removing Captain Crozier, the Navy said that his letter was a gross error that could incite panic among his crew. But it's hard to know what else he could have done -- the situation on the Theodore Roosevelt was dire.\n\nShips at sea, whether Navy carriers or cruise ships, are hotbeds for this disease. Social distancing is nearly impossible: The sailors are practically on top of one another all day, in crowded messes, in cramped sleeping quarters and on group watches.\n\nIt is thought that a sailor caught the virus while on shore leave in Vietnam. Once on board, the virus took its now predictable course: First a sailor or two, then dozens, and all of a sudden more than 100 were sick.\n\nCaptain Crozier received orders to take the ship to Guam, but he was not given permission to offload most of the sailors. The virus was threatening to overwhelm the small medical crew aboard. There was not much time before sailors might start dying.\n\nThe captain felt he had to act immediately if he was to save his sailors. He chose to write a strong letter, which he distributed to a number of people within the Navy, demanding immediate removal from the ship of as many sailors as possible. Perhaps this was not the best approach for his career, but it got results.\n\nThe letter, once leaked to The Chronicle, quickly reappeared in papers nationwide. The immediate public pressure forced the Navy to relent, and it started arranging to get as many of the crew members as possible off the ship and into hotels in Guam.\n\nCaptain Crozier, however, paid a big price. The acting secretary of the Navy, Thomas Modly, summarily fired the captain, not for leaking the letter (for which he said he had no proof), but for showing \"extremely poor judgment.\" Many disagree, believing that Captain Crozier showed excellent judgment. He left the ship Thursday night to a rousing hero's sendoff.\n\nI suppose it is too much to hope that the Navy, if only for its own benefit, will see its way to reverse this unfortunate decision. But it is probably too late to save Captain Crozier's career.\n\nAs a descendant of the namesake of Captain Crozier's former command, I often wonder, in situations like this, what Theodore Roosevelt would have done. In this case, though, I know exactly what he would have done. In 1898, he found himself in almost the exact same position.\n\nBefore his rise to national politics, Roosevelt commanded the Rough Riders, a volunteer cavalry regiment, in the invasion of Cuba during the Spanish-American War. The Battle of San Juan Hill had been fought and won, and the war was basically over. However, the soldiers, still deployed in Cuba, faced a far worse enemy: yellow fever and malaria.\n\nAs was usual in the days before modern medicine, far more soldiers died of disease than of enemy action. The battlefield commanders, including Roosevelt, wanted to bring the soldiers home. But the leadership in Washington -- in particular Russell Alger, the secretary of war -- refused, fearing a political backlash. A standoff ensued.\n\nThe career Army officers, who did not want to risk their jobs by being too outspoken, were stymied. Roosevelt, as a short-term volunteer, had less to lose. So, with the tacit approval of his fellow commanders, he wrote a fiery open letter and released it to the press.\n\nThe letter, known as the \"round robin,\" was printed in virtually every newspaper in the country, creating an uproar demanding that the soldiers be brought home immediately. Alger relented, and the troops were sent to quarantine on the end of Long Island, at Montauk Point. Though hundreds of men died of disease in Cuba, Roosevelt's actions probably saved countless more.\n\nHe did, however, pay a price. Alger was furious with him. When Roosevelt's nomination came up for a Medal of Honor, the secretary shot it down (Roosevelt eventually received the medal, posthumously, in 2001). Of course, Roosevelt came out the winner. Who today remembers Russell Alger?\n\nIn this era when so many seem to place expediency over honor, it is heartening that so many others are showing great courage, some even risking their lives. Theodore Roosevelt, in his time, chose the honorable course. Captain Crozier has done the same.\n\nTweed Roosevelt, a great-grandson of Theodore Roosevelt, is a university professor and the chairman of the Theodore Roosevelt Institute at Long Island University.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

"title": "The 1,000-Bed Comfort Was Supposed to Aid New York. It Has 3 Patients.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nSuch were the expectations for the Navy hospital ship U.S.N.S. Comfort that when it chugged into New York Harbor this week, throngs of people, momentarily forgetting the strictures of social distancing, crammed together along Manhattan's west side to catch a glimpse.\n\nOn Thursday, though, the huge white vessel, which officials had promised would bring succor to a city on the brink, sat mostly empty, infuriating local hospital executives. The ship's 1,000 beds are largely unused, its 1,200-member crew mostly idle.\n\nOnly three patients had been transferred to the ship, officials said, even as New York hospitals struggled to find space for the thousands infected with the coronavirus. Another Navy hospital ship, the U.S.N.S. Mercy, docked in Los Angeles, has had a total of 15 patients, officials said.\n\n\"If I'm blunt about it, it's a joke,\" said Michael Dowling, the head of Northwell Health, one of New York's largest hospital systems. \"Everyone can say, 'Thank you for putting up these wonderful places and opening up these cavernous halls.' But we're in a crisis here, we're in a battlefield.\"\n\nThe Comfort was sent to New York to relieve pressure on city hospitals by treating people with ailments other than Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.\n\nPresident Trump left a nine-day sequester in the White House last week to travel to Norfolk, Va., to personally see off the ship as it set sail for New York, saying it would play a \"critical role.\" The ship's arrival on Monday was cheered as one of the few bright moments in a grim time for the city.\n\nBut the reality has been different. A tangle of military protocols and bureaucratic hurdles has prevented the Comfort from accepting many patients at all.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York New York has only six days' worth of ventilators left. Javits center beds will be used for virus patients, Cuomo says. N.Y.C. officials said residents should cover their faces outside. See more updates Updated 13m ago More live coverage: Global Markets\n\nOn top of its strict rules preventing people infected with the virus from coming on board, the Navy is also refusing to treat a host of other conditions. Guidelines disseminated to hospitals included a list of 49 medical conditions that would exclude a patient from admittance to the ship.\n\nAmbulances cannot take patients directly to the Comfort; they must first deliver patients to a city hospital for a lengthy evaluation -- including a test for the virus -- and then pick them up again for transport to the ship.\n\nHospital leaders said they were exasperated by the delays.\n\nMr. Dowling said he has had to tear his hospitals apart, retrofitting any unused space, including lobbies and conference rooms, into hospital wards. His facilities now house 2,800 so-called Covid patients, up from 100 on March 20, he said. About 25 percent of those are in serious conditions in intensive care units.\n\nAcross the city, hospitals are overrun. Patients have died in hallways before they could even be hooked up to one of the few available ventilators in New York. Doctors and nurses, who have had to use the same protective gear again and again, are getting sick. So many people are dying that the city is running low on body bags.\n\nAt the same time, there is not a high volume of noncoronavirus patients. Because most New Yorkers have isolated themselves in their homes, there are fewer injuries from car accidents, gun shots and construction accidents that would require an emergency room visit.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Dowling and others said, if the Comfort refuses to take Covid patients, there are few patients to send. And given the pernicious spread of the disease in New York City, where nearly 50,000 were infected as of Thursday, dividing patients into those who have it and those who do not is pointless, he said.\n\nThe solution, he and others said, was to open the Comfort to patients with Covid-19.\n\n\"It's pretty ridiculous,\" he said. \"If you're not going to help us with the people we need help with, what's the purpose?\"\n\nAsked about Mr. Dowling's criticisms, the Defense Department referred to President Trump's statements about the Comfort at his daily briefing. The president said only that the ship was not accepting patients with the coronavirus.\n\nLate Thursday, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York reached an agreement with Mr. Trump to bring Covid patients to the Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, another alternative site operated by the military, with 2,500 hospital beds.\n\n\"I asked President Trump this morning to consider the request and the urgency of the matter, and the President has just informed me that he granted New York's request,\" Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nThere was no word about doing the same with the U.S.N.S. Comfort.\n\nCapt. Patrick Amersbach, the commanding officer of the medical personnel aboard the Comfort, said at a news conference that, for now, his orders were to accept only patients who had tested negative for the virus. If ordered to accept coronavirus patients, he said, the ship could be reconfigured to make that happen.\n\n\"If our mission shifts, we do what we can to meet that mission,\" he said.\n\nFrom the outset, readying the hospital ship for use in a pandemic proved a challenge. The Comfort was built to operate in battlefield conditions, and its physicians accustomed to treating young, otherwise healthy soldiers suffering from injuries related to gunshots and bomb blasts. Most people who are hospitalized with Covid-19 are older and infected with a novel pathogen that even the world's top medical researchers do not fully understand.\n\nAny outbreak on board could quickly spread and disable the ship's operations. As a precaution, the ship's crew isolated for two weeks before embarking on their mission to New York. They must remain onboard for the duration of their mission in New York.\n\nThe ship has struggled to fulfill civilian missions in the past. After Hurricane Maria pummeled Puerto Rico in 2017, the Comfort was sent to relieve overextended hospitals, but ended up treating only a handful of patients each day.\n\nA military physician who had previously served on the Navy's hospital ships said in an interview that conditions on board were suitable for soldiers, but, with its narrow bunked cots instead of modern hospital beds, it ws not ideal for treating civilians.\n\nThough military physicians are accustomed to battlefield situations, they are well-trained, and should be able to handle strains of the pandemic if ordered to treat patients with the coronavirus, he said.\n\n\"As military doctors,\" he said, \"they would absolutely do their best.\"\n\nMichael D.

Outbreak\n\nAUSTIN -- Two weeks ago, amid the global coronavirus pandemic, about 70 students from the University of Texas at Austin partied in Mexico on spring break. The students, all in their 20s, flew on a chartered plane to Cabo San Lucas, and some returned on separate commercial flights to Texas.\n\nNow, 28 of them have tested positive for the virus and are self-isolating. Dozens more are under quarantine and are being monitored and tested, university officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe Austin outbreak is the latest group of college students who ignored social-distancing guidelines, went on traditional spring-break trips and have now tested positive for the coronavirus. Many of them appeared to be under the mistaken impression that young people were not as vulnerable to the coronavirus as older people. Students at the University of Tampa, the University of Wisconsin at Madison and other colleges have tested positive after returning from spring break trips to Florida, Alabama, Tennessee and elsewhere.\n\nThe defiant attitude, at a time when millions of Americans were hunkered down at home and staying away from school, work and relatives, was embodied by Brady Sluder, a young man on spring break in Miami who declared on a packed beach in a widely shared television interview: \"If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I'm not going to let it stop me from partying.\" Mr. Sluder later issued an apology on Instagram.\n\nIn Austin, health officials with the city government and the university have contacted every young person who was on the chartered plane, using flight manifests from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the authorities said. City health officials used the case to urge residents of all ages to stay home and to avoid nonessential travel. Four of the 28 students who tested positive had not shown any symptoms of coronavirus.\n\n\"The virus often hides in the healthy and is given to those who are at grave risk of being hospitalized or dying,\" Dr. Mark E. Escott, the interim medical director and health authority for the city of Austin and Travis County, said in a statement. \"While younger people have less risk for complications, they are not immune from severe illness and death from Covid-19,\" the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nThe university canceled classes on March 13 and resumed instruction online on Monday.\n\n\"The incident is a very strong reminder of the importance of taking seriously the warnings of public health authorities on the risks of Covid-19,\" said J.B. Bird, director of media relations at the university.\n\nThe group of roughly 70 students departed from the Austin airport on March 14 and returned on March 19. The trip was organized by a company called JusCollege, which bills itself as a \"one-stop shop\" for spring break and college-oriented trips. The company's website still includes an event listing for \"Cabo Spring Break 2020\" from Feb. 23 to April 10. \"Join us as we take over Cabo San Lucas for Spring Break 2020!\" the listing reads. \"Place your deposit to lock in best pricing.\"\n\nThe Austin television station KVUE posted emails that the company sent to students in the days before the trip, assuring them that spring break was still on and was still safe.\n\nOne of the emails, sent by the company on March 3, read, \"We believe that our travel destinations remain among the safest and most enjoyable places in the world to visit right now.\" In another, sent on March 12, the company wrote that \"we're currently in our 2nd week of Cabo and have had almost 5,000 travelers, all with no issues.\"\n\nA statement later posted on the JusCollege website told travelers that the remaining spring break trips were being postponed until a later date in 2020. \"We are committed to building solutions that connect people and provide safety and security for our community while sustaining our love of adventure,\" the company's statement read.\n\nDavid Montgomery reported from Austin, and Manny Fernandez from Houston.", "source":

do with psychology as ideology.\n\nSince the early days of the Trump administration, an impassioned group of mental health professionals have warned the public about the president's cramped and disordered mind, a darkened attic of fluttering bats. Their assessments have been controversial. The American Psychiatric Association's code of ethics expressly forbids its members from diagnosing a public figure from afar.\n\nEnough is enough. As I've argued before, an in-person analysis of Donald J. Trump would not reveal any hidden depths -- his internal sonar could barely fathom the bottom of a sink -- and these are exceptional, urgent times. Back in October, George T. Conway III, the conservative lawyer and husband of Kellyanne, wrote a long, devastating essay for The Atlantic, noting that Trump has all the hallmarks of narcissistic personality disorder. That disorder was dangerous enough during times of prosperity, jeopardizing the moral and institutional foundations of our country.\n\nBut now we're in the midst of a global pandemic. The president's pathology is endangering not just institutions, but lives.\n\nLet's start with the basics. First: Narcissistic personalities like Trump harbor skyscraping delusions about their own capabilities. They exaggerate their accomplishments, focus obsessively on projecting power, and wish desperately to win.\n\nWhat that means, during this pandemic: Trump says we've got plenty of tests available, when we don't. He declares that Google is building a comprehensive drive-thru testing website, when it isn't. He sends a Navy hospital ship to New York and it proves little more than an excuse for a campaign commercial, arriving and sitting almost empty in the Hudson. A New York hospital executive calls it a joke.\n\nSecond: The grandiosity of narcissistic personalities belies an extreme fragility, their egos as delicate as foam. They live in terror of being upstaged. They're too thin skinned to be told they're wrong.\n\nWhat that means, during this pandemic: Narcissistic leaders never have, as Trump likes to say, the best people. They have galleries of sycophants. With the exceptions of Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, Trump has surrounded himself with a Z-team of dangerously inexperienced toadies and flunkies -- the bargain-bin rejects from Filene's Basement -- at a time when we require the brightest and most imaginative minds in the country.\n\nDebatable: Agree to disagree, or disagree better? Broaden your perspective with sharp arguments on the most pressing issues of the week.\n\nFaced with a historic public health crisis, Trump could have assembled a first-rate company of disaster preparedness experts. Instead he gave the job to his son-in-law, a man-child of breathtaking vapidity. Faced with a historic economic crisis, Trump could have assembled a team of Nobel-prize winning economists or previous treasury secretaries. Instead he talks to Larry Kudlow, a former CNBC host.\n\nMeanwhile, Fauci and Birx measure every word they say like old-time apothecaries, hoping not to humiliate the narcissist -- never humiliate a narcissist -- while discreetly correcting his false hopes and falsehoods. They are desperately attempting to create a safe space for our president, when the president should be creating a safer nation for all of us.\n\nThird: Narcissistic personalities love nothing more than engineering conflict and sowing division. It destabilizes everyone, keeps them in control.\n\nWhat that means, during this pandemic: Trump is pitting state against state for precious resources, rather than coordinating a national response. (\"It's like being on eBay,\" complained Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York last week.) His White House is a petty palace of competing power centers. He picks fights with Democratic officials and members of the press, when all the public craves is comfort.\n\nNarcissistic personalities don't do comfort. They cannot fathom the needs of other hearts.\n\nFourth: Narcissistic personalities are vindictive. On a clear day, you can see their grudges forever.\n\nWhat that means, during this pandemic: Trump is playing favorites with governors who praise him and punishing those who fail to give him the respect he believes he deserves. \"If they don't treat you right, don't call,\" he told Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nHis grudge match with New York is now especially lethal. When asked on Friday whether New York will have enough ventilators, Trump bluntly answered \"No,\" and then blamed the state.\n\nAnd most relevant, as far as history is concerned: Narcissistic personalities are weak.\n\nWhat that means, during this pandemic: Trump is genuinely afraid to lead. He can't bring himself to make robust use of the Defense Production Act, because the buck would stop with him. (To this day, he insists states should be acquiring their own ventilators.) When asked about delays in testing, he said, \"I don't take responsibility at all.\" During Friday's news conference, he added the tests \"we inherited were \"broken, were obsolete,\" when this form of coronavirus didn't even exist under his predecessor.\n\nThis sounds an awful lot like one of the three sentences that Homer Simpson swears will get you through life: \"It was like that when I got here.\"\n\nMost people, even the most hotheaded and difficult ones, have enough space in their souls to set aside their anger in times of crisis. Think of Rudolph Giuliani during Sept. 11. Think of Andrew Cuomo now.\n\nBut every aspect of Trump's crisis management has been annexed by his psychopathology. As Americans die, he boasts about his television ratings. As Americans die, he crows that he's No. 1 on Facebook, which isn't close to true.\n\nBut it is true that all eyes are on him. He's got a captive audience, an attention-addict's dream come to life. It's just that he, like all narcissistic personalities, has no clue how disgracefully -- how shamefully, how deplorably -- he'll be enshrined in memory.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Thousands of them flew directly from Wuhan, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, as American public health officials were only beginning to assess the risks to the United States.\n\nFlights continued this past week, the data show, with passengers traveling from Beijing to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, under rules that exempt Americans and some others from the clampdown that took effect on Feb. 2. In all, 279 flights from China have arrived in the United States since then, and screening procedures have been uneven, interviews show.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly suggested that his travel measures impeded the virus's spread in the United States. \"I do think we were very early, but I also think that we were very smart, because we stopped China,\" he said at a briefing on Tuesday, adding, \"That was probably the biggest decision we made so far.\" Last month, he said, \"We're the ones that kept China out of here.\"\n\nBut the analysis of the flight and other data by The New York Times shows the travel measures, however effective, may have come too late to have \"kept China out,\" particularly in light of recent statements from health officials that as many as 25 percent of people infected with the virus may never show symptoms. Many infectious-disease experts suspect that the virus had been spreading undetected for weeks after the first American case was confirmed, in Washington State, on Jan. 20, and that it had continued to be introduced. In fact, no one knows when the virus first arrived in the United States.\n\nDuring the first half of January, when Chinese officials were underplaying the severity of the outbreak, no travelers from China were screened for potential exposure to the virus. Health screening began in mid-January, but only for a number of travelers who had been in Wuhan and only at the airports in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York. By that time, about 4,000 people had already entered the United States directly from Wuhan, according to VariFlight, an aviation data company based in China. The measures were expanded to all passengers from China two weeks later.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, described Mr. Trump's travel restrictions as a \"bold decisive action which medical professionals say will prove to have saved countless lives.\" The policy took effect, he said, at a time when the global health community did not yet \"know the level of transmission or asymptomatic spread.\"\n\nTrump administration officials have also said they received significant pushback about imposing the restrictions even when they did. At the time, the World Health Organization was not recommending travel restrictions, Chinese officials rebuffed them and some scientists questioned whether curtailing travel would do any good. Some Democrats in Congress said they could lead to discrimination.\n\nIn interviews, multiple travelers who arrived after the screening was expanded said they received only passing scrutiny, with minimal follow-up.\n\n\"I was surprised at how lax the whole process was,\" said Andrew Wu, 31, who landed at Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from Beijing on March 10. \"The guy I spoke to read down a list of questions, and he didn't seem interested in checking out anything.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak A day of mourning in China, amid doubts over its virus toll. C.D.C. says all Americans should wear masks. Trump says he won't. FEMA, racing to provide virus relief, is running short on front-line staff. See more updates Updated 22m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\nSabrina Fitch, 23, flew from China to Kennedy International Airport in New York on March 23. She and the 40 or so other passengers had their temperature taken twice while en route and were required to fill out forms about their travels and health, she said.\n\n\"Besides looking at our passports, they didn't question us like we normally are questioned,\" said Ms. Fitch, who had been teaching English in China. \"So it was kind of weird, because everyone expected the opposite, where you get a lot of questions. But once we filled out the little health form, no one really cared.\"\n\nIn January, before the broad screening was in place, there were over 1,300 direct passenger flights from China to the United States, according to VariFlight and two American firms, MyRadar and FlightAware. About 381,000 travelers flew directly from China to the United States that month, about a quarter of whom were American, according to data from the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration.\n\nIn addition, untold others arrived from China on itineraries that first stopped in another country. While actual passenger counts for indirect fliers were not available, Sofia Boza-Holman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said they represented about a quarter of travelers from China. The restrictions, she added, reduced all passengers from the country by about 99 percent.\n\nMr. Trump issued his first travel restrictions related to the virus on Jan. 31, one day after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency. In a presidential proclamation, he barred foreign nationals from entering the country if they had been in China during the prior two weeks. The order exempted American citizens, green-card holders and their noncitizen relatives -- exceptions roundly recognized as necessary to allow residents to return home and prevent families from being separated. It did not apply to flights from Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nAbout 60 percent of travelers on direct flights from China in February were not American citizens, according to the most recently available government data. Most of the flights were operated by Chinese airlines after American carriers halted theirs.\n\nAt a news conference about the restrictions, Alex M. Azar II, the health secretary, repeatedly emphasized that \"the risk is low\" for Americans. He added, \"Our job is to work to keep that that way.\"\n\nHealth officials also announced an expansion of the screening beyond arrivals from Wuhan. Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, explained that people would be screened for \"significant risk, as well as any evidence of symptoms.\" If there was no reason for additional examination, \"they would be allowed to complete their travel back to their home, where they then will be monitored by the local health departments in a self-monitoring situation in their home.\"\n\nThe procedures called for screening to be conducted in empty sections of the airports, usually past customs areas. Passengers would line up and spend a minute or two having their temperature taken and being asked about their health and travel history. Those with a fever or self-reported symptoms like a cough would get a medical evaluation, and if they were thought to have been infected or exposed to the virus, they would be sent to a hospital where local health officials would take over.\n\nPassengers would also be given information cards about the virus and symptoms. Later versions advised people to stay at home for two weeks.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the C.D.C. described the entry screening as \"part of a layered approach\" that could \"slow and reduce the spread of disease\" when used with other public health measures.\n\n\"We cannot stop all introductions,\" the C.D.C. added, noting that the coronavirus pandemic was \"especially challenging due to asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections and an incubation period of up to two weeks.\"\n\nSeparately, on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the administration's measures were \"unprecedented\" and allowed \"the U.S. to stay ahead of the outbreak as it developed.\"\n\nPassengers including Mr. Wu described a cursory screening process when they arrived in the United States.\n\nMr. Wu, who has had no symptoms and has not become ill, said he was told to stay inside for 14 days when he landed in Los Angeles. He said he received two reminder messages the next day by email and text, but no further follow-up.\n\nAnother traveler, Chandler Jurinka, said his experience on Feb. 29 had an even more haphazard feel. He flew from Beijing to Seattle, with stops in Tokyo and Vancouver.\n\nAt the Seattle-Tacoma airport, he said, an immigration officer went through his documents and asked questions unrelated to the virus about his job and life in China. At no point did anyone take his temperature, he said.\n\n\"He hands me my passport and forms and says, 'Oh, by the way, you haven't been to Wuhan, have you?'\" Mr. Jurinka said. \"And then he says, 'You don't have a fever, right?'\"\n\nLike others, he left the airport with a card that recommended two weeks of self-quarantine and a promise that someone would call to check up on him. He said he never got a call.\n\nOther travelers also said the follow-up from local health departments was hit-or-miss. Some received only emails or texts.\n\nJacinda Passmore, 23, a former English teacher in China who flew into Dallas on March 10, after a layover in Tokyo, got a thorough screening at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. It took about 40 minutes, she said, before she was cleared for her flight home to Little Rock, Ark.\n\nState health workers later dropped off thermometers at her house and insisted her entire family stay home for two weeks and provide updates on their condition.\n\n\"They asked us every day: 'Have you stayed inside? Have you met anyone? Have you been quarantined?'\" Ms. Passmore said. \"They're really nice about it. They said, 'If you need anything, we can go grocery-shopping for you.'\"\n\nNineteen flights departed Wuhan in January for New York or San Francisco -- and the flights were largely full, according to VariFlight. For about 4,000 travelers, there was no enhanced screening.\n\nOn Jan. 17, the federal government began screening travelers from Wuhan, but only 400 more passengers arrived on direct flights before Chinese authorities shut down the airport. Scott Liu, 56, a Wuhan native and a textile importer who lives in New York, caught the last commercial flight, on Jan. 22.\n\nMr. Liu had gone to Wuhan for the Spring Festival on Jan. 6, but decided to come back early as the outbreak worsened. At the Wuhan airport, staff checked his temperature. On the flight, he and other passengers filled a health declaration form, which included questions about symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing.\n\nAfter they arrived at J.F.K. in New York, the passengers were directed to go through a temperature checkpoint. \"It was very fast,\" he said. \"If your temperature is normal, they will just let you in.\"\n\nMr. Liu said no one asked him questions about his travel history or health, and he received a card with information about what to do if he developed symptoms. At the time, there were no instructions to isolate. Mr. Liu said he and his friends all decided to do so anyway.\n\n\"I stayed at home for almost 20 days,\" he said.\n\nAbout 800 passengers on five charter flights were later evacuated from Wuhan by the U.S. government and directed to military bases, where they waited out two weeks of quarantine.\n\nThe charter flights began on Jan. 29. Instagram posts from one showed C.D.C. officials in full protective gear on the plane and escorting passengers after landing.\n\nOne group of passengers was eventually flown to Omaha to be taken by bus to a National Guard camp for quarantine. Video showed them accompanied by a full police escort, with lights flashing, helicopters overhead and intersections blocked off along the way.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Blow: Social distancing is a privilege", "body": "People like to say that the coronavirus is no respecter of race, class or country, that the disease COVID-19 is mindless and will infect anybody it can.\n\nIn theory, that is true. But, in practice, in the real world, this virus behaves like others, screeching like a heat-seeking missile toward the most vulnerable in society. And this happens not because it prefers them, but because they are more exposed, more fragile and more ill.\n\nWhat the vulnerable portion of society looks like varies from country to country, but in America, that vulnerability is highly intersected with race and poverty.\n\nEarly evidence from cities and states already shows that black people are disproportionately affected by the virus in devastating ways. As ProPublica reported, in Milwaukee County, Wis., as of Friday morning, 81% of the deaths were black people. Black people make up only 26% of that county.\n\nAs for Chicago, WBEZ reported Sunday that \"70% of COVID-19 deaths are black,\" and pointed out about surrounding Cook County, \"While black residents make up only 23% of the population in the county, they account for 58% of the COVID-19 deaths.\"\n\nThe Detroit News reported last week, \"At least 40% of those killed by the novel coronavirus in Michigan so far are black, a percentage that far exceeds the proportion of African Americans in the Detroit region and state.\"\n\nIf this pattern holds true across other states and cities, this virus could have a catastrophic impact on black people in this country.\n\nAnd yet, we are still not seeing an abundance of news coverage or national governmental response that center on these racial disparities. Many states haven't even released race-specific data on cases and deaths. The federal government hasn't either.\n\nPartly for this reason, we are left with deceptive and deadly misinformation. The perception that this is a jet-setters' disease, or a spring breakers' disease, or a \"Chinese virus\" as President Donald Trump likes to say, must be laid to rest. The idea that this virus is an equal-opportunity killer must itself be killed.\n\nAnd, we must dispense with the callous message that the best defense we have against the disease is something that each of us can control: We can all just stay home and keep social distance.\n\nAs a report last month by the Economic Policy Institute pointed out, \"less than one in five black workers and roughly one in six Hispanic workers are able to work from home.\"\n\nAs the report pointed out, \"Only 9.2 percent of workers in the lowest quartile of the wage distribution can telework, compared with 61.5 percent of workers in the highest quartile.\"\n\nIf you touch people for a living, in elder care or child care, if you cut or fix their hair, if you clean their spaces or cook their food, if you drive their cars or build their houses, you can't do that from home.\n\nStaying at home is a privilege. Social distancing is a privilege.\n\nThe people who can't must make terrible choices: Stay home and risk starvation or go to work and risk contagion.\n\nAnd, this isn't just happening here, it is happening with poor people around the world, from New Delhi to Mexico City.\n\nIf they go to work, they must often use crowded mass transportation, because low-wage workers can't necessarily afford to own a car or call a cab.\n\nSuch is the life of the working poor, or those slightly above poverty, but still struggling. Our entire discussion around this virus is stained with economic elitism. In social media commentary about images of packed buses and crowds of delivery workers outside restaurants, people chastise black and brown people for not always being inside, but many of those doing the chastising do so from comfortable homes with sufficient money and food.\n\nPeople can't empathize with what it truly means to be poor in this country, to live in a too-small space with too many people, to not have enough money to buy food for a long duration or anywhere to store it if they did. People don't know what it's like to live in a food desert where fresh fruit and vegetables are unavailable and nutrient-deficient junk food is cheap and exists in abundance.\n\nPeople are quick to criticize these people for crowding into local fast food restaurants to grab something to eat. Not everyone can afford to order GrubHub or FreshDirect.\n\nFurthermore, in a nation where too many black people have been made to feel that their lives are constantly under threat, the existence of yet another produces less of a panic. The ability to panic becomes a privilege existing among those who rarely have to do it.\n\nI wholeheartedly encourage everyone who can to stay home, but I'm also aware enough to know that not everyone can or will, and that it is not simply a pathological disregard for the common good.\n\nIf you are sheltering in place in an ivory tower, or even a comfortable cul-de-sac or a smartly well-appointed apartment, and your greatest concern is boredom and leftover food, please stop scolding those scratching to survive.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charles_m_blow@nytimes.com", "name": "Charles M.

Outbreak\n\nIt was an old-fashioned Southern funeral.\n\nThere was a repast table crammed with hot dishes, Brunswick stew, fried chicken and key lime cake. Andrew Jerome Mitchell, a retired janitor, was one of 10 siblings. They told stories, debated for the umpteenth time how he got the nickname Doorface.\n\nPeople wiped tears away, and embraced, and blew their noses, and belted out hymns. They laughed, remembering. It was a big gathering, with upward of 200 mourners overflowing the memorial chapel, so people had to stand outside.\n\nDorothy Johnson has gone over the scene in her mind over the last month, asking herself who it was who brought the virus to her brother's funeral.\n\nDuring the weeks that followed, illnesses linked to the coronavirus have torn through her hometown, Albany, Ga., with two dozen relatives, by her estimate, falling ill, including six of her siblings. Ms. Johnson herself was released from an isolation ward to the news that her daughter, Tonya, was in grave condition, her heart rate dropping.\n\nLike the Biogen conference in Boston and a 40th birthday party in Westport, Conn., the funeral of Andrew Jerome Mitchell on Feb. 29 will be recorded as what epidemiologists call a \"super-spreading event,\" in which a small number of people propagate a huge number of infections.\n\nThis rural county in southwest Georgia, 40 miles from the nearest interstate, now has one of the most intense clusters of the coronavirus in the country.\n\nWith a population of only 90,000, Dougherty County has registered 24 deaths, far more than any other county in the state, with six more possible coronavirus deaths under investigation, according to Michael L. Fowler, the local coroner. Ninety percent of the people who died were African-American, he said.\n\nThe region's hospitals are overloaded with sick and dying patients, having registered nearly 600 positive cases. Last week, Gov. Brian Kemp dispatched the National Guard to help stage additional intensive care beds and relieve exhausted doctors and nurses.\n\nAs she considered the damage, Ms. Johnson returned, for a moment, to the question of who it was, at her brother's funeral, who introduced the virus.\n\n\"We don't know who the person was,\" she said. \"It would help me to know.\"\n\nWhether this question matters at all -- the whodunit of infectious disease -- depends on who you ask. But the timing does matter. For 10 days the virus spread, invisibly, and no one knew it was there. By the time stringent social distancing was introduced, on March 22, it was everywhere.\n\n\"We're not blaming that one visitor, but potentially a community is one person away from something like this exploding,\" said Scott Steiner, the chief executive of Phoebe Putney Health System, which has taken the brunt of the surge.\n\n\"If you get early delivery of it, it shows you what can happen,\" he said. \"Had that person come in, had a barbecue, visited family and went home, that would have been a different story.\"\n\nA big Southern funeral\n\nEmell Murray, Mr. Mitchell's companion of 20 years, found him dead in the living room of their home on the morning of Feb. 24, said her daughter, Alice Bell. There was no autopsy, but it appeared to be natural causes, she said, possibly a heart attack.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Despite pushback, Trump tells governors he \"hasn't heard about testing in weeks.\" As governors beg, Trump promises ventilators to Europe. As the virus's impact expands, Washington mulls more emergency measures. See more updates Updated 15m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\n\"He had been up all night,\" said Ms. Johnson, his sister. \"When she woke up to get the baby ready for school, she found him face down on the floor.\"\n\nThe night of the funeral, a 67-year-old man who had come to Albany to attend was admitted to Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, complaining of shortness of breath, Mr. Steiner said.\n\nThe man had chronic lung disease, and no history of travel that would suggest exposure to the coronavirus, and he was not put in isolation, Mr. Steiner said. Staff members figured that he had just run out of oxygen.\n\nThe man spent the next week in the hospital, attended by at least 50 employees, then was transferred on March 7 back to the Atlanta area, where he was tested for the coronavirus. Not until March 10 did the Albany hospital learn he had tested positive, Mr. Steiner said. He died on March 12, the state's first coronavirus death.\n\nBy then, the infection was quietly spreading through town. Mr. Mitchell's longtime companion, Ms. Murray, 75, found herself wracked with chills and fever, Ms. Bell, her daughter, said. She was told she had a urinary tract infection and admitted to an ordinary ward, where she was visited by three of her sisters, Ms. Bell said. All three have since become sick with the coronavirus, she said. One of them has died.\n\n'It hit like a bomb'\n\nOn March 10, word reached Albany that the Phoebe Putney patient had tested positive. A few days of relative quiet followed, and then, in the words of Mr. Fowler, the coroner, \"it hit like a bomb.\"\n\n\"Some of them might have went to the funeral,\" Mr. Fowler said. \"Some may have been family members of people at the funeral. Every day after that, someone was dying.\"\n\nThe six-month stockpile of protective equipment that the hospital had prepared was gone, Mr. Steiner said, in seven days.\n\nAt first the doctors and nurses just tried to take in what they were seeing: a series of people -- including young people in relatively good health -- showing up with a cough and fever.\n\nThen, alarmingly, their need for oxygen would sharply increase, and they would go into full-blown respiratory failure, their lungs filling with fluid, said Enrique Lopez, 41, a surgical intensivist, who specializes in treating the critically ill.\n\n\"All the units were full, all of them, and there would be days when we would be intubating five people in a row, back to back, room after room after room,\" he said. \"It was one of the times in my career I truly felt overwhelmed.\"\n\nThe cases arrived in great waves, overwhelming each new effort to add beds.\n\nThe 14 medical intensive care unit beds were filled within two days of the first wave of coronavirus patients; they converted 12 cardiac I.C.U. beds, but those, too, were filled two days later; 12 beds in the surgical I.C.U. were filled three days after that, Mr. Steiner said.\n\nFor a few days, the hospital was so short of staff members that employees who had tested positive but did not yet have symptoms were asked to work.\n\n\"If I had 1,000 nurses sitting at home, and could send the ones testing positive out, I would, but we don't have that, and nobody has that,\" Mr. Steiner said. \"You get to the point where you say, 'If I don't have the staff, I can't care for the patients.'\"\n\nState directives changed last week, mandating a weeklong quarantine for health care workers who test positive.\n\nDr. Lopez, the surgeon, avoided contact with his family for two weeks, for fear of infecting them.\n\n\"I'm sleeping in the garage in one of our closets,\" he said. \"I park the truck, strip down in the garage, wash myself off, my wife puts out a plate of food for me, I eat the food, and then I go back to the garage.\"\n\nDetective work\n\nThe funerals -- of Mr. Mitchell, and then of a man named Johnny Carter, held at the funeral home a week later -- quickly emerged as a source of infection.\n\nOf the first 23 patients to test positive, all had attended one of the two funerals, Mr. Steiner said. That was easy to figure out.\n\n\"This wasn't like a team of scientists in a bunch of suits,\" said Chris J. Cohilas, chairman of the Dougherty County Board of Commissioners. \"We're a big small town where everybody knows everybody. We know who is in our hospital, and we know who went to what funeral.\"\n\nWord went out \"so quickly and so aggressively\" that those who attended either of the funerals should get tested, Mr. Cohilas said.But not quickly enough to prevent an infected person from serving as a juror in a high-profile murder trial that ended on March 12. That set off a new set of infections in the sheriff's office and the courthouse, he said.\n\nThe warnings drove a wedge between people in Albany, said the Rev. Daniel Simmons, the senior pastor of Albany's Mt. Zion Baptist Church, who, like others interviewed, said he questioned whether the funerals were in fact the sole source of the infections.\n\n\"It created fear: Who will be at the gathering that I'm going to on Sunday, that funeral, or that wedding? Do I go? Do I not go?\" Mr. Simmons said. \"People began to say, were you at the funeral? That became a question.\"\n\nThe city's churches, he said, began to feel unfairly singled out.\n\n\"That is the focus: the church, the church,\" he said. \"It has done damage because there is stigma. There is almost this wall of hostility that has been raised between certain parts of the community and the church.\"\n\nMs. Johnson, whose family hosted the Feb. 29 funeral, said the speculation had been painful.\n\n\"I have family members angry because people are saying that my brother was the culprit,\" she said. \"He's a dead person. He's not even breathing. But they're angry because the rumor mill is saying that he was the spreader of the virus.\"\n\nA scramble for care\n\nBy last week, the question of how the virus had entered the county had been eclipsed by the number of people sick and dying. Mr. Mitchell's companion, Ms. Murray, has been hospitalized and discharged twice, the last time on March 24, against her daughter's protests.\n\n\"I begged them not to let her come home, but they did it anyway,\" Ms. Bell said. \"They brought her into this house like a sack of potatoes, on a stretcher.\"\n\nMs. Bell, 49, said she did not have the strength to turn her mother over in bed, and had called repeatedly to ask for help.\n\n\"I'm begging for help,\" she said. \"I'm here with two kids, and I don't know if I have been exposed to it.\"\n\nShe feels, she said, \"as if they sent my mother home to die.\"\n\nPhoebe Putney is diverting patients to other Georgia hospitals at a rate it has never before approached, transferring 40 in a recent 72-hour period, Mr. Steiner said. But he denied that any gravely ill patients have been sent home.\n\n\"Anybody we've discharged has been discharged appropriately, clinically,\" he said.\n\nMr. Simmons said that many families are struggling to care for the sick at home, and that for some, a sense of panic has begun to set in.\n\n\"Part of the control in life is thinking, if you needed help, you've got somewhere to go,\" he said. \"When that is taken off the table, all sense of control is gone, and hope starts fading.\"\n\nHe read aloud text messages he received over the weekend. \"Please continue to pray,\" one said. \"My mother, my grandmother and my grandfather have been admitted to the ER with coronavirus symptoms.\"\n\nThen, later, \"My mother has died.\"\n\nFor Ms. Johnson, only one person mattered last week.\n\nHer daughter, Tonya M. Thomas, was all she thought of while she was in the hospitalThe illness had hit them almost simultaneously, but unaccountably, her 51-year-old daughter was the worst hit, with double pneumonia.\n\n\"I was trying to feel better so I could come up here and take care of my daughter,\" said Ms. Johnson, a retired oncology nurse. \"I felt like if I hadn't been in the hospital I could have advocated for her.\"\n\nShe arrived in time, at 5:45 on Friday afternoon, to be with Ms. Thomas as she died.She called her \"a beautiful spirit,\" her family's center.\n\nShe unplugged her daughter's ventilators and removed the IV tubes from her body.\n\nMs. Thomas's husband, son and sister Abrigale were in the room.\n\n\"It just hurts so bad, I just don't understand it,\" Ms. Johnson said. \"We came together at a funeral of someone we love, and everyone came up and got sick.\"\n\nHer daughter's funeral will be at the graveside, with no more than 10 people present, in accordance with social distancing regulation.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellen_barry@nytimes.com", "name": "Ellen Barry", "type": "author", "isAgency":

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/sports/transgender-idaho-ban-sports.html", "title": "'Boys Are Boys and Girls Are Girls': Idaho Is First State to Bar Some Transgender Athletes", "body": "Student-athletes from elementary school age through college may have to consent to sex testing in order to compete.\n\nIdaho has become the first state in the U.S. to bar transgender girls from participating in girls and women's sports and to legalize the practice of asking girls and women to undergo sex testing in order to compete.\n\nThe house bill, known as the \"Fairness in Women's Sports Act,\" was signed by Gov. Brad Little on Monday. Gov. Little also signed a bill that prohibits transgender people from changing their birth certificates to match their gender identities.\n\nWhile many states have introduced bills to restrict the participation of transgender athletes, Idaho is the first state to have passed such legislation into law.\n\nDespite a movement in broader society toward endorsing transgender rights, supporters of the Idaho laws said they did not accept people identifying as anything but what was written on their birth certificates. They said the laws were aimed primarily at athletes who were identified as boys on their birth certificates but now identify as female and wish to compete as such.\n\n\"Boys are boys and girls are girls,\" State Senator Lee Heider said after the bills passed through the Senate two weeks ago. \"No doctor, no judge, no Department of Health and Welfare is going to change that reality.\"\n\nRepresentative Barbara Ehardt, the sponsor of the bill, said she began working on it 20 months ago in an effort to \"protect opportunities for girls and women.\"\n\n\"We physically cannot compete against biological boys, we just cannot, and once those opportunities are lost, they are gone, you cannot get those back,\" Ehardt, a former collegiate basketball player and N.C.A.A. Division I women's basketball coach, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. \"This could literally tear teams and communities apart.\"\n\nMany major companies with large facilities in Idaho, including Chobani and Hewlett-Packard, called on the governor, who, like the bills' sponsors is a Republican, to veto the bill.\n\nThe bills were signed a day before the International Transgender Day of Visibility on Tuesday, and passed as Idaho recorded its largest single day jump of coronavirus cases.\n\nThe bills are expected to face lengthy and expensive legal battles. In 2018, a federal court found unconstitutional a policy similar to Idaho's new law barring changes on birth certificates. The state attorney general's office expressed concern over the constitutionality of the restrictions on sports participation, writing that, among other things, the legislation could violate the federal law known as Title IX that prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions receiving federal financing.\n\nThe Idaho legislation points to an emerging conflict over whether or how to regulate transgender athletes. The debate has become a wedge issue especially among conservatives trying to rally support for President Trump.\n\nThose who want to limit the participation of transgender athletes have argued that transgender women have a competitive advantage because of their testosterone levels, though those levels can change in hormone treatment. Athletes like the Olympic marathon runner Paula Radcliffe and the tennis star Martina Navratilova have contended that athletes with higher natural levels of testosterone are able to outperform their competitors, especially in some track and field events and in weight lifting competitions. Navratilova later backed away from that view.\n\nCaster Semenya, a two-time Olympic gold medal runner from South Africa, is the highest profile athlete to have faced a barrage of criticism, tests, and most recently, restrictions over her sex. She has identified as female since birth and has naturally occurring elevated levels of testosterone. Last July, she lost her challenge of a policy enacted by track and field's governing body, that barred her from some events unless she underwent hormone therapy.\n\nBut the science on the subject remains highly debated and inconclusive. A high natural testosterone level is not a one-step advantage in and of itself. Many have questioned why one physical trait -- testosterone level -- is thought to be an unfair advantage, when many of the world's best athletes possess others -- Michael Phelps's flipper-sized feet, for example -- that propel them to unthinkable world records.\n\nThe Idaho High School Activities Association already has a policy in place on the inclusion of transgender athletes that mirrors that of the N.C.A.A. and International Olympic Committee. The N.C.A.A. recommends that schools require transgender athletes complete one year of hormone treatment before competing on a female team. Similarly, the I.O.C. guidelines require transgender athletes competing on a female team to demonstrate testosterone levels below 10 nanomoles per liter for one year.\n\nIdaho's law, however, is a blanket ban on the participation of transgender girls in sports.\n\nThe law includes a provision that allows for anyone to file a claim questioning the sex of an athlete. The adjudication process could lead to sex testing that would allow for genital exams, genetic testing and hormone testing. \"They can have a DNA test to determine chromosomes, and those tests are as cheap as $50,\" Ehardt said. \"And again, if there are questions beyond that, there are hormone, urine and blood tests that are much more common.\"\n\nIntersex athletes, individuals born with a range of sex characteristics, would also be subject to added scrutiny. \"If there was a situation such as that, that person's doctor would no doubt already be familiar and already be in a position to solve and indicate if the DNA was not a female,\" Ehardt continued. She called such a hypothetical situation a \"rare, rare, rare case.\"\n\nStudies have suggested that 1.7 percent of the population has intersex traits.\n\nThere have been a record number of bills placing restrictions on transgender people nationwide since the beginning of the year. A bill similar to Idaho's was introduced in Arizona, only to see a genital testing provision dropped before the bill was passed in the Arizona House in early March. The practice of gender verification testing has been banned by the International Olympic Committee since 1999.\n\nKathy Griesmyer, a policy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union's Idaho chapter, said the testing provision not only discriminated against transgender youth but also opened the door for widespread abuse. \"There is now a law you can use to attack any successful female athlete,\" she said, noting that exact guidelines of these processes are not yet clear. \"And to think this is about helping girls, when we know it's subjecting girls to an invasive examination of their bodies at a vulnerable time of their development.\"\n\nLindsay Hecox, a first-year student at Boise State University and a former high school track and cross country runner, said the bill further \"others,\" or marginalizes, transgender athletes like herself.\n\n\"I'm just a simple college student who just wants to run and doesn't want to have my rights taken away,\" Hecox said, adding that she is taking the year off from competitive running to focus on transitioning. \"Being trans shouldn't make me a big news story, it shouldn't make a spectacle. I'm just a normal person.\"\n\nA recent survey found that 12 percent of transgender girls and 14 percent of transgender boys play team sports compared to the national average of 68 percent of all youth. When states enact policies that create barriers for transgender athletes, the number of all L.G.B.T.Q. athletes in youth sports further declines.\n\n\"We don't want to have any advantage,\" Hecox said on Tuesday. \"All I want to do is run, have a team, have friends on the team, and all try together. There's no vindictiveness here of me trying to take away a girl's scholarship or trophy or places.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

"title": "Restrictions Are Slowing Coronavirus Infections, New Data Suggest", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nHarsh measures, including stay-at-home orders and restaurant closures, are contributing to rapid drops in the numbers of fevers -- a signal symptom of most coronavirus infections -- recorded in states across the country, according to intriguing new data produced by a medical technology firm.\n\nAt least 248 million Americans in at least 29 states have been told to stay at home. It had seemed nearly impossible for public heath officials to know how effective this measure and others have been in slowing the coronavirus.\n\nBut the new data offer evidence, in real time, that tight social-distancing restrictions may be working, potentially reducing hospital overcrowding and lowering death rates, experts said.\n\nThe company, Kinsa Health, which produces internet-connected thermometers, first created a national map of fever levels on March 22 and was able to spot the trend within a day. Since then, data from the health departments of New York State and Washington State have buttressed the finding, making it clear that social distancing is saving lives.\n\nThe trend has become so obvious that on Sunday, President Trump extended until the end of April his recommendation that Americans stay in lockdown. Mr. Trump had hoped to lift restrictions by Easter and send Americans back to work.\n\n\"That would have been the worst possible Easter surprise,\" said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who added that he thought the Kinsa predictions were based on \"very robust technology.\"\n\nKinsa's thermometers upload the user's temperature readings to a centralized database; the data enable the company to track fevers across the United States.\n\nOwners of Kinsa's thermometers can type other symptoms into a cellphone app after taking their temperature. The app offers basic advice on whether they should seek medical attention.\n\nKinsa has more than one million thermometers in circulation and has been getting up to 162,000 daily temperature readings since Covid-19 began spreading in the country.\n\nThe company normally uses that data to track the spread of influenza. Since 2018, when it had more than 500,000 thermometers distributed, its predictions have routinely been two to three weeks ahead of those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which gathers flu data on patient symptoms from doctors' offices and hospitals.\n\nTo identify clusters of coronavirus infections, Kinsa recently adapted its software to detect spikes of \"atypical fever\" that do not correlate with historical flu patterns and are likely attributable to the coronavirus.\n\nAs of noon Wednesday, the company's live map showed fevers holding steady or dropping almost universally across the country, with two prominent exceptions.\n\nOne was in a broad swath of New Mexico, where the governor had issued stay-at-home orders only the day before, and in adjacent counties in Southern Colorado.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Despite pushback, Trump tells governors he \"hasn't heard about testing in weeks.\" As governors beg, Trump promises ventilators to Europe. As the virus's impact expands, Washington mulls more emergency measures.

That presumably was caused by the outward local spread of the explosion of infections in New Orleans, which officials believe was set off by crowding during Mardi Gras.\n\nBy Friday morning, fevers in every county in the country were on a downward trend, depicted in four shades of blue on the map.\n\nFevers were dropping especially rapidly in the West, from Utah to California and from Washington down to Arizona; in many Western counties, the numbers of people reporting high fevers fell by almost 20 percent. The numbers were also declining rapidly in Maine.\n\nThe parts of New Mexico and Colorado that had been slightly \"warm\" on Wednesday were in light blue, indicating that they were cooling. So were the Louisiana counties.\n\nAs of Monday morning, more than three-quarters of the country was deep blue. A separate display of the collective national fever trend, which had spiked upward to a peak on March 17, had fallen so far that it was actually below the band showing historical flu fever trends -- which meant that the lockdown has cut not only Covid-19 transmission but flu transmission, too.\n\n\"I'm very impressed by this,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine expert at Vanderbilt University. \"It looks like a way to prove that social distancing works.\"\n\n\"But it does shows that it takes the most restrictive measures to make a real difference,\" he added.\n\nFor some hard-hit cities, Kinsa also sent The New York Times fever data plotted on a timeline of restrictions enacted by mayors or governors.\n\nThose graphs, Dr. Schaffner noted, showed that simply declaring a state of emergency or limiting the size of public gatherings did not affect the number of people reporting fevers.\n\nBut closing restaurants and bars and asking people to stay in their homes produced dramatic results in all three cities.\n\nFor example, in Manhattan, reports of fevers steadily rose during early March, despite a declaration of emergency on March 7 and an order on March 12 that public gatherings be restricted to less than 500 people.\n\nThe turning point began on March 16, the day schools were closed. Bars and restaurants were closed the next day, and a stay-at-home order took effect on March 20. By March 23, new fevers in Manhattan were below their March 1 levels.\n\nLast Friday, New York State's own data showed the same trend that Kinsa's fever readings had spotted five days earlier.\n\nThe state tracks hospitalization rates, not fevers. So many patients were being admitted to New York City hospitals, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said, that until March 20, hospitalization rates were doubling roughly every two days.\n\nBy Tuesday, the hospitalization rate took four days to double. This is roughly what the fever readings predicted, said Nita Nehru, a company spokeswoman.\n\nHospitalizations occur several days after symptoms like fever appear. \"The cases being counted now had fevers five to 10 days ago,\" she said.\n\nThe slowing of new hospital admissions \"suggests that our density-control measures may be working,\" Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday.\n\n\"People say these requirements -- no restaurants, no nonessential workers -- are burdensome,\" he said. \"And they are burdensome. But they are effective, and they are necessary. The evidence suggests that they have slowed our hospitalizations, and that is everything.\"\n\nShown the Kinsa data, Dr. Howard Zucker, New York State's health commissioner, called it \"a great example of technology being able to show what we think we're experiencing -- and it's consistent with our data.\"\n\nOn Friday, the University of California, San Francisco, said its hospitals were not facing a huge surge of patients and gave the credit to the strict shelter-in-place orders imposed by Mayor London Breed on March 16.\n\nOn Sunday, Washington State also reported a downward trend following the imposition of its restrictions, based on data from deaths, coronavirus tests and information about people's movements from the Facebook apps on their cellphones.\n\n\"People need to know their sacrifices are helping,\" said Inder Singh, founder of Kinsa. \"I've had friends text or call and say: 'Inder, this seems overblown. I'm sitting at home by myself, I don't know anyone who's sick, why am I doing this?'\"\n\nKinsa's tracking of fevers in Miami-Dade County in Florida showed an even more pronounced trend, and the company had tried to raise the alarm.\n\nIn early March, Florida beaches and bars were packed with spring break revelers, despite warnings that crowding was dangerous. On Kinsa maps that normally look for flu trends, fever levels were soaring.\n\nMr. Singh tried to get the word out, but the San Francisco-based company is relatively obscure and almost no one paid attention.\n\n\"It was so frustrating,\" said Ms. Nehru, the company spokeswoman. \"For three days from about March 19 on, Inder was calling local government folks in Florida, The Tampa Bay Times and other papers. The government did absolutely nothing.\"\n\n\"Plus, we were getting pushback on social media,\" she said. \"People were saying, 'The testing doesn't show this, you know, is your data wrong?' and 'Could it be that you were just selling more thermometers in Florida?'\"\n\nOn March 12, a state of emergency had been declared, but according to Kinsa's data, fevers were continuing to rise. Closing local schools on March 16 had little effect.\n\nBut on March 18, Miami's bars and restaurants were closed, and within two days reports of fevers started to drop sharply, according to Kinsa's data.\n\nBut the damage may have been done. Now Florida is reporting that coronavirus cases are soaring, and its hospitals expect to be overwhelmed.\n\nThe dropping fever trend does not mean cases or hospitalizations will also drop immediately, Ms. Nehru pointed out.\n\nConfirmed cases will keep going up for days, because people do not always go for a Covid-19 test the same day they feel feverish. Besides, many states are doing more tests every day.\n\nThe C.D.C. has declined to comment whenever it is asked about the company.\n\nMr. Singh said he had approached the C.D.C. about using his data as part of its own flu surveillance, but agency officers had insisted on him giving up the rights to his data if they did, and he refused.\n\nDr. Schaffner, an adviser to the C.D.C. on flu surveillance, said he was disappointed to hear that and would look into it.\n\nThe refinement Kinsa made on March 22 was to add \"trends\" -- a map showing whether all fevers were increasing, decreasing or holding steady.\n\n\"Finally, people are asking us for our data,\" Mr. Singh said Monday. \"We're talking with six states about them distributing more thermometers. People understand the value now.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"title": "After Threats, Anthony Fauci to Receive Enhanced Personal Security", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases, who has become a regular at President Trump's coronavirus briefings, will receive enhanced personal security after receiving threats following his repeated pleas for Americans to help slow the spread of the deadly pandemic, officials said on Wednesday.\n\nDr. Fauci has been the Trump administration's most outspoken advocate of social distancing rules that have shuttered the nation's schools, forced businesses to close, kept people in their homes and battered the United States economy.\n\nThat has made him a target of online conspiracy theorists who have accused Dr. Fauci, a longtime scientist and civil servant who has served presidents of both parties, of trying to undermine Mr. Trump during a year in which the president is fighting for re-election.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services granted the enhanced personal security for Dr. Fauci, 79, after the Justice Department signed off on a request for extra agents to guard him, officials said. Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, had grown worried that the threats against the doctor were increasing as more of the country shut down in response to the coronavirus.\n\n\"Yesterday, upon the recommendation of the U.S. Marshals Service, the department approved the special deputization request from H.H.S. for nine H.H.S.-O.I.G. special agents to provide protective services for Dr. Fauci,\" the Justice Department said in a statement, referring to the Office of the Inspector General at the health department. The Washington Post first reported the news of the enhanced security.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Shortages, stay-at-home orders and sobering economic predictions. What do you have to do to get your stimulus check? In some cases, it's complicated. The federal government's supply of masks, gloves and gowns is nearly gone. See more updates Updated 14m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\nCaitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the health department, would not confirm Dr. Fauci's enhanced security but called him \"an integral part of the U.S. government's response against Covid-19,\" referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\n\"Among other efforts,\" she added, \"he is leading the development of a Covid-19 vaccine and he regularly appears at White House press briefings and media interviews.\"\n\nThe coronavirus could kill 100,000 to more than 200,000 Americans in the coming weeks. Dr. Fauci, along with a fellow task force member, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, encouraged Mr. Trump to extend the amount of time that the country would remain shuttered through the end of this month. Some states, like Virginia, have issued stay-at-home orders that do not expire until further into the spring.\n\nThe idea that Dr. Fauci is responsible for the country's hardship -- and for whatever political damage Mr. Trump might suffer as a result -- was fueled in part by a moment during a news briefing in which Dr. Fauci dropped his head and touched his forehead as the president was speaking. The image went viral online and right-wing supporters of Mr. Trump cited it as evidence that Dr. Fauci sought to undercut the president.\n\nOne anti-Fauci Twitter post last week said, \"Sorry liberals but we don't trust Dr. Anthony Fauci.\"\n\nThe hashtag #FauciFraud has been used by more than 70 Twitter accounts, some posting hundreds of times a day, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Criticism of Dr. Fauci has also come from leading conservative voices and supporters of Mr. Trump, including Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group; Bill Mitchell, the host of the far-right online talk show \"YourVoice America\"; and Shiva Ayyadurai, who has falsely claimed to be the inventor of email.\n\nBut Mr. Trump himself has praised the doctor. During Wednesday's briefing, when a reporter asked about Dr. Fauci's personal security, the president said: \"He doesn't need security. Everybody loves him.\"\n\nIn fact, Dr. Fauci has earned plaudits from many medical experts and public health officials for his often grim assessment of the threats facing the United States from the coronavirus -- even sometimes contradicting the president's rosier outlook.\n\nFor weeks, Dr. Fauci's remarks on television and at the White House stood in sharp contrast to the commentary from Mr. Trump's fiercest supporters on Fox News, whose leading hosts repeatedly claimed that Democrats, the news media and public health experts were inflating the threat of the virus.\n\nAfter the viral video of Dr. Fauci lowering his head, online attacks against him increased. A seven-year-old email that he wrote to an aide of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's was posted online by The American Thinker, a conservative blog. In the email, Dr. Fauci praised Mrs. Clinton for her stamina during hearings into the 2012 attacks on the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. The blog suggested falsely that the email proved that Dr. Fauci was part of a secret group who opposed Mr. Trump.\n\nIronically, in the past several days, the president has largely adopted Dr. Fauci's more dire warnings about the dangers of the rapidly spreading virus. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump called it a \"great national trial unlike any we have ever faced before\" and echoed Dr. Fauci's language about the need to minimize its spread.\n\n\"It's a matter of life and death, frankly,\" Mr. Trump said, offering a sober assessment of the pandemic's effect. \"It's a matter of life and death.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_benner@nytimes.com", "name": "Katie Benner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

As of Thursday afternoon, at least 51,000 people have died, and the virus has been detected in at least 171 countries, as these maps show. There is evidence on six continents of sustained transmission of the virus.\n\nThe New York Times is engaged in an effort to track the details of every confirmed case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest information our journalists are gathering from around the country. The Times has made that data public in hopes of helping researchers and policymakers as they seek to slow the pandemic and prevent future ones.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than one million people in at least 171 countries.\n\nStates face a shortage of lifesaving medications, and the C.D.C. is expected to recommend Americans wear masks in public.\n\nThe United States continued to grapple with how to best slow the spread of the pandemic as more than 250,000 Americans on Thursday were confirmed to be infected.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to advise all Americans to wear cloth masks in public, but President Trump said on Thursday that such a directive would not be mandatory.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, who is coordinating the federal response, said that social distancing, and not masks, was key to slowing the spread. She pleaded with Americans to follow the government's safety guidelines.\n\n\"I can tell by the curve, and as it is today that not every American is following it,\" she said.\n\nThere are still a dozen states where governors have resisted issuing stay-at-home orders. An analysis of cellphone location data by The New York Times found that people in the Southeast and other places that were slow enact such orders have continued to travel widely, potentially exposing more people as the outbreak accelerates.\n\nFor weeks, health care providers have sounded the alarm on a shortage of ventilators and protective gear, but now medicines are in short supply as well.\n\nAs the numbers of the infected and dead continue to soar, hospitals are reporting that some critical medicines are beginning to run low -- including drugs that are used to keep patients' airways open, antibiotics, antivirals and sedatives.\n\nNew York State, the center of America's outbreak with 2,468 coronavirus deaths, estimates its stockpile of critically needed ventilators will be depleted by the end of next week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said. And President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to require 3M Company, a major manufacturer of face masks, to turn over stocks of much-needed respirators to the federal government.\n\nAnother grim statistic on Thursday further revealed the scope of the economic disaster: 6.6 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week. The Labor Department reported the loss of nearly 10 million jobs in only two weeks.\n\nAmong American businesses seeking financial breathing room is the president's family company, the Trump Organization, which has been exploring whether it can delay some of its financial obligations, according to a New York Times investigation.\n\nAnd on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump lashed out at congressional Democrats after Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she had created a bipartisan committee to oversee all aspects of the government's response to the virus. Mr. Trump accused them of \"conducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic.\"\n\nHow coronavirus is causing confusion with terms like 'peaks,' 'testing' and 'lockdown.'\n\nMaking sense of the coronavirus pandemic requires getting up to speed on semantics as much as epidemiology.\n\nGovernment officials and health care professionals toss off mentions of mortality rates, flattening the curve and lockdowns, assuming that we know what they mean. But the terms mean different things from country to country, state to state, even city to city and person to person.\n\nOfficials use the same phrases about mass testing, caseloads and deaths to describe very different situations. That makes it hard to give clear answers to vital questions: How bad are things? Where are they headed?\n\nPeople search for insight by comparing their countries to those that are farther along in the epidemic. But if the terms are misleading or used in differing ways, the comparisons are flawed. Also, the statistics and vocabulary offer a false sense of precision while in reality, the information we have shows only a fraction of what's going on.\n\n\"The new cases or deaths each day are given as exact numbers and we're trained to take that at face value,\" said Mark N. Lurie, an epidemiologist at Brown University's School of Public Health. \"But those are far from exact, they're deeply flawed, and their meaning varies from place to place and from time period to time period.\"\n\nIndia is cracking down on its free press to shape virus coverage.\n\nThe Media One anchorman Vinesh Kunhiraman went on air as usual on March 6, ready to tell the station's five million viewers in India's Kerala State about the death anniversary of a beloved comedian and the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJust a few minutes into the broadcast, he saw the managing editor rush to the studio floor, gesturing wildly. \"I realized something was not right,\" Mr. Kunhiraman recalled.\n\nThe station's uplink suddenly went dead. Mr. Kunhiraman's image dissolved into a blue screen. A bland message told viewers there was no signal. \"We regret the inconvenience,\" it said.\n\nBut this was no technical difficulty. The station had been cut off by an order from India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The government decided to block the channel for 48 hours because it had covered February's biggest news story -- the mob attacks on Muslims in New Delhi that flared into broader unrest -- in a way that seemed critical of the Delhi Police and a Hindu-nationalist social movement with close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nTrump invokes Defense Production Act, and criticizes 3M.\n\nPresident Trump took aim on Thursday at the manufacturing giant 3M, which has been increasing production of N95 respirator masks that filter small particles and droplets from the air.\n\n\"We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks,\" he said in a Twitter message. \"Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing -- will have a big price to pay!\"\n\nAt a White House briefing earlier in the day, Mr. Trump announced he was invoking the Defense Production Act, a 1950s law, to help shore up dwindling supplies of masks and other supplies. The move came after desperate pleas from governors and health care officials who are trying to handle the spike in patients infected by coronavirus.\n\nAs the virus swept across the country, overwhelming hospitals, 3M had said that it was speeding up production of N95 masks and that it planned to increase output in the United States by 30 percent over the next year.\n\nThe company usually makes about 400 million masks a year. It is unclear what set off President Trump, but his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, made an oblique reference to 3M at the briefing, mentioning that \"we've had some issues making sure that all of the production that 3M does around the world,\" ends up being sent \"to the right places.\"\n\nEven as the U.S. grapples with a mask shortage, 3M has continued to sell the critical safety equipment abroad, according to someone with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nSome businesses aren't eager to take government aid.\n\nSome corporate leaders are bristling at the potential terms of the grants and loans authorized by the stimulus legislation President Trump signed last week. Boeing's chief executive, David Calhoun, for one has suggested that the aerospace company could raise money elsewhere if it found the government's terms too onerous.\n\nThe Treasury Department, led by Steven Mnuchin, a former investment banker, might try to avoid imposing conditions that companies find burdensome. But if the aid appears too lenient, popular support for the rescue could evaporate as it did with the bailout of banks and other businesses after the 2008 financial crisis. And some lawmakers and experts argue that Mr. Mnuchin ought to resist the temptation to cut businesses too sweet a deal to prevent them from walking away from the government's offer.\n\n\"Either they don't need money, which means they shouldn't get the money,\" Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in an interview. \"Or maybe they really do need it, in which case they should agree to some restrictions on how the money is spent.\"\n\nTaking a tougher line with companies could bolster the overall economic impact of the aid. Demanding that companies maintain hiring levels, for example, might mean that more people have money coming into their bank accounts, allowing them to spend on necessities and pay the rent or mortgage, said Phil Angelides, a former treasurer of California and chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which was created by Congress in 2009.\n\nOf course, with revenues falling off a cliff and losses piling up, some companies may be so desperate that their chief executives happily accept terms like a temporary ban on companies buying their own shares, a condition that airline executives have said they are willing to accept. Others may accept aid simply because the public wants them to.\n\nOne big difference between the economic problems of today and the 2008 financial crisis is that most of the companies in need of relief are not suffering from self-inflicted wounds. \"That's obvious to most people, and a C.E.O. will have this defense at his or her disposal,\" said Tony Fratto, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury and a former deputy press secretary for President George W. Bush.\n\nRight now, policymakers are keenly watching how airlines and Boeing might respond.\n\nUnderstanding the confusion about masks\n\nShould you wear a mask when you go out, or not? Both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously said that ordinary citizens do not need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. But the official guidelines are shifting.\n\nReporting was contributed by Vindu Goel, Jeffrey Gettleman, Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a, Peter Eavis, Niraj Chokshi, David Gelles, Michael Corkery, Julia

In emergency rooms and intensive care units, typically dispassionate medical professionals are feeling panicked as increasing numbers of colleagues get sick.\n\n\"I feel like we're all just being sent to slaughter,\" said Thomas Riley, a nurse at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, who has contracted the virus, along with his husband.\n\nMedical workers are still showing up day after day to face overflowing emergency rooms, earning them praise as heroes. Thousands of volunteers have signed up to join their colleagues.\n\nBut doctors and nurses said they can look overseas for a dark glimpse of the risk they are facing, especially when protective gear has been in short supply.\n\nIn China, more than 3,000 doctors were infected, nearly half of them in Wuhan, where the pandemic began, according to Chinese government statistics. Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who first tried to raise the alarm about Covid-19, eventually died of it.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Governor Cuomo said that 1,218 people had died in New York, up from 965 on Sunday morning. A man was accused of coughing on F.B.I. agents and saying he had the virus. A floating military hospital arrived in New York. See more updates Updated 6h ago More live coverage: Global Markets\n\nIn Italy, the number of infected heath care workers is now twice the Chinese total, and the National Federation of Orders of Surgeons and Dentists has compiled a list of 50 who have died. Nearly 14 percent of Spain's confirmed coronavirus cases are medical professionals.\n\nNew York City's health care system is sprawling and disjointed, making precise infection rates among medical workers difficult to calculate. A spokesman for the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs New York City's public hospitals, said the agency would not share data about sick medical workers \"at this time.\"\n\nWilliam P. Jaquis, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said the situation across the country was too fluid to begin tracking such data, but he said he expected the danger to intensify.\n\n\"Doctors are getting sick everywhere,\" he said.\n\nLast week, two nurses in New York, including Kious Kelly, a 48-year-old assistant nurse manager at Mount Sinai West, died from the disease; they are believed to be the first known victims among the city's medical workers. Health care workers across the city said they feared many more would follow.\n\nMr. Riley, the nurse at Jacobi, said when he looked at the emergency room recently, he realized he and his colleagues would never avoid being infected. Patients struggling to breathe with lungs that sounded like sandpaper had crowded the hospital. Masks and protective gowns were in short supply.\n\n\"I'm swimming in this,\" he said he thought. \"I'm pretty sure I'm getting this.\"\n\nHis symptoms began with a cough, then a fever, then nausea and diarrhea. Days later, his husband became ill. Mr. Riley said both he and his husband appear to be getting better, but are still experiencing symptoms.\n\nLike generals steadying their troops before battle, hospital supervisors in New York have had to rally, cajole and sometimes threaten workers.\n\n\"Our health care systems are at war with a pandemic virus,\" Craig R. Smith, the surgeon-in-chief at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, wrote in an email to staff on March 16, the day after New York City shut down its school system to contain the virus. \"You are expected to keep fighting with whatever weapons you're capable of working.\"\n\n\"Sick is relative,\" he wrote, adding that workers would not even be tested for the virus unless they were \"unequivocally exposed and symptomatic to the point of needing admission to the hospital.\"\n\n\"That means you come to work,\" he wrote. \"Period.\"\n\nArriving to work each day, doctors and nurses are met with confusion and chaos.\n\nAt a branch of the Montefiore hospital system in the Bronx, nurses wear their winter coats in an unheated tent set up to triage patients with symptoms, while at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, patients are sometimes dying before they can be moved into beds.\n\nThe inviolable rules that once gave a sense of rhythm and harmony to even the busiest emergency rooms have in some cases been cast aside. Few things have caused more anxiety than shifting protocols meant to preserve a dwindling supply of protective gear.\n\nWhen the pandemic first hit New York, medical workers changed gowns and masks each time they visited an infected patient. Then, they were told to keep their protective gear on until the end of their shift. As supplies became even more scarce, one doctor working on an intensive care unit said he was asked to turn in his mask and face shield at the end of his shift to be sterilized for future use. Others are being told to store their masks in a paper bag between shifts.\n\n\"It puts us in danger, it puts our patients in danger. I can't believe in the United States that's what's happening,\" said Kelley Cabrera, an emergency room nurse at Jacobi Medical Center.\n\nAn emergency room doctor at Long Island Jewish Medical Center put it more bluntly: \"It's literally, wash your hands a lot, cross your fingers, pray.\"\n\nDoctors and nurses fear they could be transmitting the virus to their patients, compounding the crisis by transforming hospitals into incubators for the virus. That has happened in Italy, in part because infected doctors struggle through their shifts, according to an article published by physicians at a hospital in Bergamo, a city in one of the hardest-hit regions.\n\nFrontline hospital workers in New York are now required to take their temperature every 12 hours, though many doctors and nurses fear they could contract the disease and spread it to patients before they become symptomatic.\n\nThey also say it is a challenge to know when to come back to work after being sick. All medical workers who show symptoms, even if they are not tested, must quarantine for at least seven days and must be asymptomatic for three days before coming back to work.\n\nBut some employers have been more demanding than others, workers said.\n\nLillian Udell, a nurse at Lincoln Medical Center, another public hospital in the Bronx, said she was still weak and experiencing symptoms when she was pressured to return to work. She powered through a long shift that was so chaotic she could not remember how many patients she attended. By the time she returned home, the chills and the cough had returned.\n\n\"I knew it was still in me,\" she said. \"I knew I wasn't myself.\"\n\nChristopher Miller, a spokesman for the Health and Hospitals Corporation, said the agency could not comment on Ms. Udell's claim, but said its hospitals had \"never asked health care workers who are sick and have symptoms of Covid-19 to continue to work or to come back to work.\"\n\nThere is also the fear of bringing the disease home to spouses and children. Some medical workers said they were sleeping in different rooms from their partners and even wearing surgical masks at home. Others have chosen to isolate themselves from their families completely, sending spouses and children to live outside the city, or moving into hotels.\n\n\"I come home, I strip naked, put clothes in a bag and put them in the washer and take a shower,\" one New York City doctor at a large public hospital said.\n\nBecause the pathogen has spread so widely, even medical workers not assigned directly to work with infected patients risk contracting the disease.\n\nA gynecologist who works for the Mount Sinai hospital system said she had begun seeing women in labor who were positive for the coronavirus. Because she is not considered a front-line worker, she said, restrictions on protective gear are even more stringent than on Covid-19 units. She said she was not aware of any patients who had tested positive after contact with doctors or nurses, but felt it was only a matter of time.\n\n\"We're definitely contaminating pregnant mothers that we're assessing and possibly discharging home,\" said the doctor, who spoke on condition on anonymity because her hospital had not authorized her to speak.\n\nMount Sinai said in a statement that it had faced equipment shortages like other hospitals, but added the issues had been solved in part by a large shipment of masks that arrived from China over the weekend. The hospital \"moved mountains\" to get the shipment, the statement said.\n\nThis week, the Health and Hospitals Corporation recommended transferring doctors and nurses at higher risk of infection -- such as those who are older or with underlying medical conditions -- from jobs interacting with patients to more administrative positions.\n\nBut Kimberly Marsh, a nurse at Westchester Medical Center outside New York City, said she has no intention of leaving the fight, even though she is a 53-year-old smoker with multiple sclerosis and on a medication that warns against getting near people with infections.\n\n\"It almost feels selfish,\" she said, though she acknowledged that with two years before retirement she could not afford leave if she wanted to.\n\nEven so, she said, the fear is palpable each time she steps into the emergency room. A nurse on her unit has already contracted the virus and one doctor is so scared he affixes an N95 mask to his face with tape at the beginning of each shift. Ms. Marsh said she sweats profusely in her protective gear because she is going through menopause and suffers from hot flashes.\n\n\"We all think we're screwed,\" she said. \"I know without any doubt that I'm going to lose colleagues. There's just no way around it.\"\n\nSomini Sengupta, Brian M.

"title": "Trump Administration, in Biggest Environmental Rollback, to Announce Auto Pollution Rules", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is expected on Tuesday to announce its final rule to roll back Obama-era automobile fuel efficiency standards, relaxing efforts to limit climate-warming tailpipe pollution and virtually undoing the government's biggest effort to combat climate change.\n\nThe new rule, written by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation, would allow vehicles on American roads to emits nearly a billion tons more carbon dioxide over the lifetime of the cars than they would have under the Obama standards and hundreds of millions of tons more than will be emitted under standards being implemented in Europe and Asia.\n\nTrump administration officials have raced to complete the auto rule by this spring, even as the White House is consumed with responding to the coronavirus crisis. President Trump is expected to extol the rule, which will stand as one of the most consequential regulatory rollbacks of his administration, as a needed salve for an economy crippled by the pandemic.\n\nThe lower fuel-efficiency standard \"is the single most important thing that the administration can do to fulfill President Trump's campaign promise of reforming the regulatory state, and to undo the impact that the previous administration has had on the economy,\" said Thomas J. Pyle, the president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization that supports the use of fossil fuels.\n\nMr. Trump's critics say the rule shows the president's disregard for science and could actually harm the economy over time. The administration's own draft economic analyses of the rule showed that it could hurt consumers by forcing them to purchase more gasoline. And a February report by a panel of government-appointed scientists, many of them selected by the Trump administration, concluded that \"there are significant weaknesses in the scientific analysis\" of the rule.\n\n\"This is not just an inopportune moment to finalize a major rule-making,\" said Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee. \"In this case, it's a completely irresponsible one.\"\n\nEven many large automakers, which had asked Mr. Trump to slightly loosen the Obama-era rule, had urged him not to roll it back so aggressively, since that plan is certain to get bogged down in court for years, leaving their industry in regulatory limbo.\n\nA spokesman for the Alliance of Automotive Innovation, the lobbying group that represents over a dozen of the world's largest automakers, declined to comment on the still-unpublished rule.\n\nThe new rule, which is expected to be implemented by late spring, will roll back a 2012 rule that required automakers' fleets to average about 54 miles per gallon by 2025. Instead, the fleets would have to average about 40 miles per gallon. To meet the new number, fuel economy standards would have to rise by about 1.5 percent a year, compared to the 5 percent annual increase required by the Obama rule. The industry has said it would increase fuel economy standards by about 2.4 percent a year without any regulation.\n\nThe new standard would lead to nearly a billion more tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide released and the consumption of about 80 billion more gallons of gasoline over the lifetime of the vehicles built during the terms of the rule, according to a recent draft of the plan.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, completing the rollback of his predecessor's climate change policy caps a three-year march to weaken or undo nearly 100 rules and regulations that had limited industrial pollution of smog, toxic chemicals, greenhouse gases and water contaminants.\n\nBusinesses said those rules had hamstrung their growth and left them less competitive in a global economy. Environmentalists said they were vital to the health and future of the planet and its inhabitants.\n\nFor environmentalists, the tailpipe-emissions rule culminates Mr. Trump's quest to dismantle the United States' efforts to fight climate change, which has so far included pulling out of the global Paris climate change accord, weakening rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electric plants, and undermining the basic science that underpins environmental regulations.\n\nThe regulation on vehicle fuel economy, first issued in 2009 and updated in 2012, was the first federal policy to lower emissions of greenhouse gases that causes climate change, and it remains the policy that would have reduced emissions the most, chiefly by targeting the nation's largest source of climate-warming emissions: cars and trucks.\n\n\"In the march of rollbacks of climate rules, this is the biggest step,\" said David Victor, director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nThe new rule creates short-term regulatory relief for automakers, lifting requirements that had forced them to invest heavily in developing and marketing hybrid, electric and low-pollution vehicles.\n\nBut in the long run, analysts say, the new standard could actually bring more uncertainty to the auto industry. The legal status of the new Trump rule remains unclear; about 20 states are expected to sue the administration to undo it in a case expected to be resolved by the Supreme Court in the coming years. The new rule is also expected to become a divisive issue in the 2020 presidential campaign, with Democrats vowing to reinstate the Obama rule.\n\nTrump administration officials have been plagued with difficulties and delays as they have tried to write a rule that would meet the president's desire for a drastic regulatory rollback that also would be scientifically sound and legally defensible.\n\nThe chief cause of the delay has been an internal economic analysis concluding that the rule would harm consumers more than helping them. A draft of the rule sent to the White House in January calculated that the new fuel economy target would lower the prices of new cars and light trucks by about $1,000, but it would increase the amount consumers would pay for gasoline by about $1,400.\n\nThe administration's draft analysis concluded that the rule could actually cost the American economy between $13 billion and $22 billion.\n\nAs administration officials sought to rework those numbers to show that the rule would help consumers, automakers pushed the White House to complete the rule by March 30, the deadline needed to begin manufacturing vehicles under the new standard for the 2022 model year.\n\nOver the weekend, White House officials looked at a new option for their cost-benefit analysis, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked to speak anonymously because the rule was not yet final. The new analysis would put a price tag on consumer preference for less fuel-efficient vehicles, between $38 billion and $58 billion, hoping to show an economic benefit for removing the requirement that auto companies sell higher-mileage cars.\n\nSome analysts scoffed at that assertion.\n\n\"It's not going to be supported by the science,\" said Chet France, a former senior E.P.A. vehicle emissions specialist who is now a consultant who works with the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. This will be the icing on cake of the legal flaws.\"\n\nIf the rule does survive legal challenges, it would put the United States out of step with the rest of the global auto market, moving it from one of the strongest fuel economy standards in the world to one of the weakest. The American standard would be lower than those of the European Union, China, India, Japan and South Korea. That could present long-term challenges to the American auto industry, as other automakers develop more sophisticated, high-efficiency, low-pollution vehicles while American ones focus on gas guzzlers.\n\n\"The U.S. went from being the laggard of the world on these standards, to being the country that was setting the pace for the rest of the world -- and now it's going back to being the laggard,\" said Anup Bandivadekar, director of the passenger vehicle program for the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit research organization. \"Among the major markets, automakers now will no longer first have to think of U.S.\"\n\nThe new measure will combine with a related rule, issued last year, that revoked the right of California and other states to set their own tougher vehicle emissions standards. California has spearheaded a pair of multistate lawsuits to block both rules, escalating a political war between Mr. Trump and the nation's most populous state.\n\nThose legal wars have already left automakers in limbo. The chief executives of the Big Three automakers personally asked Mr. Trump at the outset of his administration to loosen the Obama auto rules, chiefly by giving them a longer timeline to comply, but many auto executives grew alarmed at the scale of the president's rollbacks and the lawsuits they triggered.\n\nIn a letter to Mr. Trump last June, 17 companies -- including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volvo -- asked Mr. Trump to go back to the negotiating table on the planned rollback, saying a drastic reversal threatened to cut their profits and produce \"untenable\" instability. They predicted \"an extended period of litigation and instability\" if his plans were implemented.\n\n\"We strongly believe the best path to preserve good auto jobs and keep new vehicles affordable for more Americans is a final rule supported by all parties -- including California,\" the companies wrote.\n\nThen, in July, four automakers -- Ford Motor Company, Volkswagen of America, Honda and BMW -- announced that they had struck a deal with California to comply with state-level standards that demand fuel economy of 51 miles per gallon by 2026.\n\nUltimately, the limits on atmospheric emissions will likely be decided by the Supreme Court. Automakers most fear verdicts that uphold the legal authority of California and other states to enact their own standards, and allow the Trump standards to move forward elsewhere. That would split the nation's auto market in two.\n\n\"One thing we've learned from the Trump administration is be careful what you ask for,\" said Dr. Victor of the University of California, San Diego.\n\n\"The auto industry wanted a smoother glide path to a more efficient future,\" he added. \"Instead what they got was the populist politics of the far right, which is blowing up in their faces.\"\n\nMr. Trump's defenders say his moves are not aimed at automakers but at consumers who generally prefer larger vehicles, such as pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.\n\n\"He's not doing it to be conciliatory to industry, he's doing it for consumers, and for his own personal and political reason,\" Mr. Pyle said.\n\nFor more climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or

Luxury", "body": "It has been about two weeks since the Illinois governor ordered residents to stay at home, but nothing has changed about Adarra Benjamin's responsibilities. She gets on a bus nearly every morning in Chicago, traveling 20 miles round trip some days to cook, clean and shop for her clients, who are older or have health problems that make such tasks difficult.\n\nMs. Benjamin knows the dangers, but she needs her job, which pays about $13 an hour. She also cannot imagine leaving her clients to fend for themselves. \"They've become my family,\" she said.\n\nIn cities across America, many lower-income workers continue to move around, while those who make more money are staying home and limiting their exposure to the coronavirus, according to smartphone location data analyzed by The New York Times.\n\nAlthough people in all income groups are moving less than they did before the crisis, wealthier people are staying home the most, especially during the workweek. Not only that, but in nearly every state, they began doing so days before the poor, giving them a head start on social distancing as the virus spread, according to aggregated data from the location analysis company Cuebiq, which tracks about 15 million cellphone users nationwide daily.\n\nThe data offers real-time evidence of a divide laid bare by the coronavirus pandemic -- one in which wealthier people not only have more job security and benefits but also may be better able to avoid becoming sick. The outbreak is so new that the relationship between socioeconomic status and infection rates cannot be determined, but other data, including recent statistics released by public health officials in New York City, suggests that the coronavirus is hitting low-income neighborhoods the hardest.\n\nConcerns about getting infected have incited protests and strikes by workers in grocery stores, delivery services and other industries who say their employers are not providing them with enough protection or compensation to counter the increased health risks, even as their jobs have been deemed essential.\n\nRules vary among states, but essential workers generally include those in health care and public safety roles, as well as caregivers, delivery drivers, grocery clerks and plumbers. Hardware stores, pharmacies and takeout restaurants also remain open and staffed. All of these workers are able to stay on the job -- a boon in an economy seized by shutdowns -- but in most cases they cannot claim unemployment benefits if they quit.\n\n\"People want to talk about this virus as an equal opportunity pathogen, but it's really not,\" said Dr. Ashwin Vasan, a doctor and public health professor at Columbia University. \"It's going right to the fissures in our society.\"\n\nThe mobility data provides a snapshot in time, and the behaviors it captures could change amid a fast-moving crisis. Although several public policy experts who reviewed the data said it strongly indicated that wealthier people are better able to stay home, they added that there could be other reasons for the differences -- perhaps higher awareness of the risks or better access to information, for example -- and others that are not yet obvious.\n\nEconomists and public health researchers said the data pointed to holes in the government's response to the pandemic's fallout for low-income workers, which has focused on those who have lost their jobs because of shutdowns and not on those with essential duties.\n\n\"Covid-19 is exposing a lot of the structural disadvantages that low-income people face,\" including a lack of job security and uneven access to health care, said Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied the essential work force. \"The well-off are employed in industries where they are at a desk, and so there are some advantages built into these high-income neighborhoods during this pandemic,\" he added.\n\nIn metro areas with the greatest disparity between the richest and the poorest residents -- and where there are orders to stay home -- people in higher-income neighborhoods have essentially halted movement. People in lower-income neighborhoods have also drastically reduced their movement, but the data shows an uptick in their movements after the third weekend of March, coinciding with the start of another workweek.\n\nIn other areas where income disparity was not as high, it was much more likely that both the richest and poorest continued to move. These cities were also in places that were less likely to have mandated that residents stay home.\n\nMany essential workers are in lower-income jobs and have positions that require them to leave home and work face-to-face with others, economists said. \"The people at this income, they're either furloughed and not coming in to work, or they are essential construction, grocery cashiers, workers in long-term care institutions,\" said Matthew Rae, who directs a program on health care markets at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\"And hundreds of thousands of them don't have health insurance.\"\n\nMs. Benjamin, the health worker in Chicago's Woodlawn neighborhood, is 26 and among those without health insurance. She carries bottled soap and hand sanitizer with her and is vigilant about not touching her face. But she is worried.\n\n\"I do have gloves, but I just ran out of masks,\" she said, \"and I have no idea where I'm going to get any from.\"\n\nJust 15 miles north of Ms. Benjamin, in the Uptown neighborhood, John Williams has been working at home since March 16, five days before the governor's order went into effect. A communications worker for nonprofits, Mr. Williams said people on his team were already used to telecommuting but that his husband, a high school music teacher, had faced more challenges.\"Honestly, we are grateful for the privilege and security we have at the moment, knock on wood,\" he said. \"It's uncomfortable, but it's not life-threateningly scary.\"\n\nAs federal lawmakers contend with shuttered businesses and millions of people suddenly out of work, little of their legislation has been tailored to help essential workers affected by the pandemic. These workers will get the same stimulus checks that other people get from the $2 trillion economic stabilization package, and the second phase of the coronavirus legislation expanded the mandate for paid sick leave related to Covid-19. But while Democrats have renewed their push to include expanded occupational safety requirements for workers, which failed to gain traction in the most recent legislation, and are also calling for additional hazard pay for workers on the front lines, it is unclear if either of those will prevail in future negotiations.\n\nMr. Tomer, of Brookings, said life insurance and targeted coronavirus-related health insurance for essential workers could help. \"It's about peace of mind for them and their families, and a form of compensation,\" he said.\n\nIn reports from many cities, workers have alternated between fear at being exposed to the virus and relief at having a job while so many others are unemployed. Ridership on New York's subway system has plummeted, but stations in poorer areas remain crowded.\n\nIn Seattle, one of the earliest coronavirus hotspots in the country, Cassandra Fejarang, a Teamsters union member, was laid off from her restaurant supply position in March but was able to find work in a Safeway grocery distribution center. She travels a few miles by car to the warehouse in Auburn, Wash.\n\n\"I'm blessed to still be able to work,\" said Ms. Fejarang, 34. She said she has been pulling 10- and 16-hour shifts, loading packs of frozen food, toilet paper, bleach and other goods onto pallets to be taken to stores. Grocery warehouse workers in her union make a good wage -- $20 to $29 an hour -- and have negotiated extra benefits during the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\"I definitely wear gloves and try to keep my mask on because we're surrounded by people all day,\" she said. \"We are all washing our hands, trying to keep our distance. It's hard, but I feel safe when I'm there.\"\n\nWashington State, which had the earliest known major outbreak of coronavirus in the United States, stands out from the rest of the country because the wealthiest people there had nearly a week's head start over the poorest when it came to staying home.\n\nWith this highly transmissible virus, even days can make a difference in limiting or igniting an outbreak, said Dr. Vasan, the Columbia professor.\n\n\"It's just moving like wildfire through communities,\" Dr. Vasan said. \"We talk about flattening the curve, and every day people are not staying home just makes that harder.\"\n\nDr. Vasan and other public health experts cautioned that the nature of this virus means that inequality in health outcomes puts the entire population at greater risk. Pockets of people who are untested or who don't get the appropriate medical treatment can quickly become new clusters.\n\nMs. Benjamin, the home care worker, said she was proud to be essential but would feel better with assurances that she could be taken care of if she fell ill.\n\n\"I just really want people to understand that it's hard right now to go to work and live for other people,\" she said. \"I want to make sure that they know we're all in this together. Everyone is scared, but the world is in this together.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators.html", "title": "Opinion | What You Should Know Before You Need a Ventilator", "body": "Dr. Dreger is a doctor of internal medicine in Northern Virginia and a clinical assistant professor of medicine at Georgetown University.\n\nDay by day, as the number of Covid-19 deaths soar, we see more clearly that many of us will not survive this storm.\n\nIn the most serious cases, breathing becomes so labored that ventilators have to be used to keep patients alive. That there may not be enough of these machines is horrifying and infuriating.\n\nBut even if there were, it breaks my heart that Americans who get sick enough to need them won't know what desperate situations they face, nor will they understand what ventilators can do to help, and what they can never fix.\n\nAs hard as the facts may be, knowledge will make us less afraid.\n\nLet me begin simply. When we take a breath, we pull air through our windpipe, the trachea. This pipe then branches in two, then again into smaller and smaller pipes finally ending in tiny tubes less than a millimeter across called bronchioles. At the very end of each are clusters of microscopic sacs called alveoli.\n\nThe lining of each sac is so thin that air floats through them into the red blood cells. These millions of alveoli are so soft, so gentle, that a healthy lung has almost no substance. Touching it feels like reaching into a bowl of whipped cream.\n\nCovid-19 changes all that.\n\nIt causes a gummy yellow fluid, called exudate, to fill the air sacs, stopping the free flow of oxygen. If only a few air sacs are filled, the rest of the lung takes over. When more and more alveoli are filled, the lung texture changes, beginning to feel more like a marshmallow than whipped cream.\n\nThis terrible disease is called acute respiratory distress syndrome. Covid-19 can cause an incredibly lethal form of this, in which oxygen levels plunge and breathing becomes impossible without a ventilator.\n\nSpecially trained health care workers insert a 10-inch-long tube connected to a ventilator through the mouth and into the windpipe. The ventilator delivers more oxygen into the lungs at pressure high enough to open up the stiffened lungs.\n\nIt's called life support for a reason; it buys us time. Ventilators keep oxygen going to the brain, the heart and the kidneys. All while we hope the infection will ease, and the lungs will begin to improve.\n\nThese machines can't fix the terrible damage the virus is causing, and if the virus erupts, the lungs will get even stiffer, as hard as a stale marshmallow.\n\n\"I feel like I'm trying to ventilate bricks instead of lungs,\" one intensive care unit doctor who has been treating Covid-19 patients told me.\n\nThe heart begins to struggle, begins to fail. Blood pressure readings plummet, a condition called shock. For some, the kidneys fail completely, which means a dialysis machine is also needed to survive.\n\nDoctors are left with impossible choices. Too much oxygen poisons the air sacs, worsening the lung damage, but too little damages the brain and kidneys. Too much air pressure damages the lung, but too little means the oxygen can't get in. Doctors try to optimize, to tweak.\n\nNobody can tolerate being ventilated like this without sedation. Covid-19 patients are put into a medically induced coma before being placed on a ventilator. They do not suffer, but they cannot talk to us and they cannot tell us how much of this care they want.\n\nEventually, all the efforts of health care workers may not be enough, and the body begins to collapse. No matter how loved, how vital or how needed a person is, even the most modern technology isn't always enough. Death, while typically painless, is no less final.\n\nEven among the Covid-19 patients who are ventilated and then discharged from the intensive care unit, some have died within days from heart damage.\n\nEven before Covid-19, for those lucky enough to leave the hospital alive after suffering acute respiratory distress syndrome, recovery can take months or years. The amount of sedation needed for Covid 19 patients can cause profound complications, damaging muscles and nerves, making it hard for those who survive to walk, move or even think as well as they did before they became ill. Many spend most of their recovery time in a rehabilitation center, and older patients often never go home. They live out their days bed bound, at higher risk of recurrent infections, bed sores and trips back to the hospital.\n\nAll this does not mean we shouldn't use ventilators to try to save people. It just means we have to ask ourselves some serious questions: What do I value about my life? If I will die if I am not put in a medical coma and placed on a ventilator, do I want that life support? If I do choose to be placed on a ventilator, how far do I want to go? Do I want to continue on the machine if my kidneys shut down? Do I want tubes feeding me so I can stay on the ventilator for weeks?\n\nRight now, all over the country, patients and their families are being asked to make these difficult decisions at a moment's notice, while they are on the verge of dying, breathless and terrified.\n\nIf patients get worse after being put on a ventilator, critical care doctors are having to ask their family members what they want done. Covid-19 is too contagious to have these conversations in person, so they are being done over the phone. It is yet another heartbreaking reality of dying during a pandemic. Patients cannot tell us what they want. Family members aren't able to be with patients and may not know what they would want.\n\nNo one can make these choices for us, and no one will know what choices we would make unless we tell them. If you don't want to be put in a coma and placed on life support, please let your family know. Appoint the person you want to make decisions for you and let your doctor know your wishes. The truth is we are facing a disaster. Let's not use up precious resources on someone who doesn't want them. We will still care for you to the end, but we won't put you on a machine if you don't want to be on it.\n\nIf the person you love is on a ventilator right now, find out exactly how bad his or her lungs are. The doctors will tell you the truth. And the truth, no matter how painful, eases fear. The understanding that comes with it helps us make the best choices for the ones we love.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
