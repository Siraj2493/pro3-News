Mr. Pence was scheduled to lead a meeting of the government's coronavirus task force on Thursday.\n\nIn turn, Mr. Pence said on Thursday that he had selected Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the director of the United States effort to combat H.I.V. and AIDS, to serve as the Coronavirus Response Coordinator for the White House, enlisting an experienced scientist and physician to manage the response to the potential spread of the virus.\n\nThe announcements from the White House were intended to show that Mr. Trump and those around him are taking the potential threat to the health of Americans seriously. Aides said the president wanted governors and members of Congress to have a single point-person to communicate with, eliminating any jockeying for power in a decentralized situation.\n\nBut with Mr. Pence's announcement, Ms. Birx becomes the third person to be designated as the administration's primary coronavirus official.\n\nMr. Trump said that \"Mike is going to be in charge, and Mike will report back to me.\" Mr. Pence said it will be Ms. Birx. Meanwhile, Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, remains the chairman of the government's coronavirus task force.\n\nThe vice president's first move appeared to be aimed at preventing the kind of contradictory statements from White House officials and top government health officials that have plagued the administration's response. Even during his news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Trump rejected the assessment from a top health official that it was inevitable that the coronavirus would spread more broadly inside the United States.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for eldery family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak.\n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the country's leading experts on viruses and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, told associates that the White House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.\n\nThe new White House approach came as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged Thursday that a California woman with coronavirus was made to wait days before she was tested for the disease because of the agency's restrictive criteria about who may get tested.\n\nAnd despite Mr. Trump's efforts to calm the nation's jittery investors, stock markets plunged again Thursday morning, opening about 2 percent lower amid concerns about the potential affects of the virus on the global economy. Earlier, European and Japanese stocks fell as well, closing more than 2 percent lower.\n\nThe president's decision to appoint Mr. Pence to lead the coronavirus response came after several days in which his aides grappled with whether to name a \"coronavirus czar\" to coordinate the alphabet soup of federal health and security agencies that have roles to play in protecting the country.\n\nMr. Trump said at his news conference that he was pleased with Mr. Azar's performance, calling the team that he has led \"totally brilliant.\" But White House aides, led by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, have been debating for days whether the administration needed a point person to be the face of the response.\n\nThe decision to put Mr. Pence in charge was made on Wednesday after the president told some people that the vice president didn't \"have anything else to do,\" according to people familiar with the president's comments.\n\nMs. Birx has spent more than three decades working on H.I.V./AIDS immunology, vaccine research, and global health, according to the White House, which said in a statement that she would \"bring her infectious disease, immunologic, vaccine research and interagency coordinating capacity to this position.\"\n\nThe president's selection of Mr. Pence -- and the decision to name Dr. Birx as the coordinator for the response -- further erodes Mr. Azar's traditional role as the nation's top health official in charge of directing the government's response to a medical crisis. Mr. Trump has told people that he considers Mr. Azar to be too \"alarmist\" about the virus.\n\nMr. Azar denied reports that he was not consulted about the decision or told before the announcement Wednesday evening. He told lawmakers during a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Thursday that when he was informed of Mr. Pence's selection to head the coronavirus task force, \"I said, quote, 'that's genius.'\"\n\nAides to Mr. Pence are aware that there are political risks for the vice president if the response to the virus falters in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nCritics of the vice president quickly pointed to Mr. Pence's record on public health issues when he was governor of Indiana as evidence that he was not the right person to lead the government's response to a health crisis. Democrats noted that Mr. Pence was blamed for aggravating a severe AIDS outbreak among intravenous drug users when he opposed calls for a clean needle exchange program on the grounds it would encourage more drug use.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Thursday morning that she had told Mr. Pence directly that she questioned his new role given that he had \"slashed\" the public health budget when he was governor of Indiana.\n\n\"I spoke with the vice president this morning, made some of these concerns known to him,\" she said. \"We have always had a very candid relationship and I expressed to him the concern that I had of his being in this position.\"\n\nNikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador who has kept herself in the news as a possible rival to Mr. Pence as the president's running mate on the 2020 re-election ticket, was rallying Trump supporters at a gathering of conservative activists on Thursday.\n\n\"President Trump brought capitalism back,\" Ms. Haley told the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference as she kicked off the four-day meeting. Mr. Pence is also scheduled to speak at the gathering.\n\nBut Mr. Pence's allies played down the political risks to the vice president and said it was a good idea to put him in charge.\n\n\"He's been actively involved already,\" Mr. Meadows said. \"He, with Secretary Azar, have been really engaged for weeks. It's good to have someone that ultimately can be an addition to the team, although he's been a part of it. They have Azar and some on his team on the technical side of the virus, but making sure we have a proper response is key.\"\n\nMr. Meadows minimized concerns that being the position put Mr. Pence in a precarious position. \"I think the response will go well,\" Mr. Meadows said. Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, he said were \"both committed to making sure they get a number of data points and communicate it efficiently.\"\n\nAnnie Karni and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_d_shear@nytimes.com", "name": "Michael D.

guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus newsletter.\n\nThe surgeon general on Saturday urged the public to stop buying masks, warning that it won't help against the spread of the coronavirus but will take away important resources from health care professionals.\n\n\"Seriously people -- STOP BUYING MASKS!\" the surgeon general, Jerome M. Adams, said in a tweet on Saturday morning. \"They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!\"\n\nThe plea comes as panicked consumers rush to buy masks online, a surge that has led to price gouging and counterfeit products.\n\nIn another tweet, Mr. Adams said the best way to protect against the virus is to wash hands regularly, and for those who are feeling ill to stay home.\n\nWhile masks help prevent the spread of droplets from a person's cough or sneeze, medical specialists have said masks are generally not effective because air can get in around the edges of the masks.\n\nA person is more likely to get infected by touching contaminated surfaces than from a droplet traveling through the air. But medical professionals need a large supply of the masks because they are in direct contact with infected patients and must change their masks repeatedly.\n\nRobert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday that it was critical that masks remain available for doctors and nurses who were caring for those affected by the virus and for people tending to loved ones with the illness.\n\n\"There is no role for these masks in the community,\" he said. \"These masks need to be prioritized for health care professionals that as part of their job are taking care of individuals.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maria_cramer@nytimes.com", "name": "Maria Cramer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counterfeit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Foreign_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Specialty (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 57}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Home_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Home Health", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Home_Health/Home_Care", "label": "dmoz/Health/Home Health/Home Care", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "wgt": 20}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/29/us/29xp-mask/29xp-mask-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5556444", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 82101, "pinterest": 10}, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 82111, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1460015194", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-25", "time": "05:08:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-25T05:08:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-25T05:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/world/asia/coronavirus-news.html", "title": "Coronavirus Live Updates: Markets Reel as Virus Spreads Across the World", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nRead Updates in Chinese: \u65b0\u51a0\u75c5\u6bd2\u75ab\u60c5\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\u6c47\u603b\n\nHere's what you need to know:Stocks continue to fall in Asia, but at a slower pace.As infections slow in China, they increase elsewhere around the world.C.D.C. warns Americans against traveling to South Korea.White House asks Congress for $2.5 billion to fight the outbreak.A judge prevented California from moving some patients.Stocks continue to fall in Asia, but at a slower pace.\n\nShare prices in Asia slid for the second straight day, albeit at a more moderate pace, as investors took their cue from Monday's sell-offs in Europe and the United States.\n\nThe steepest losses in Asia on Tuesday occurred in Japan, where markets were closed for a holiday on Monday. The Nikkei 225 index was down almost 3 percent by late morning. Most other Asian markets fell at a much slower pace.\n\nFutures trading indicated that American and European markets may be little changed or up slightly when they open on Tuesday.\n\nThe Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets dropped 2 percent by late Tuesday morning. Both markets had been fairly insulated from the global selling on Monday, a stability that analysts attributed to Beijing policies such as ordering fund managers not to sell more shares than they buy. Beijing has a history of tolerating share price declines more readily if they look like echoes of Wall Street's activity, and that appeared to be true on Tuesday as well.\n\nThe Hong Kong market was little changed, after falling more than the mainland markets on Monday.\n\nIn South Korea, shaken by the world's second largest outbreak outside of China, share prices rebounded on Tuesday morning after enduring on Monday one of the sharpest drops of any large market around the world. By late morning, share prices there were up about 0.5 percent.\n\nStock markets in commodity-exporting countries continue to suffer losses as traders worry that demand for their goods may decline if more countries suffer the kind of bruising deceleration in economic activity that China has endured.

And the world is not prepared for a major outbreak, World Health Organization officials said on Monday.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nA W.H.O. mission to China has said that the daily tally of new cases there peaked and then plateaued between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2, and has steadily declined since.\n\nChinese officials reported 508 new cases and 71 deaths as of Monday, a slower pace than in previous days.\n\nBy Tuesday, South Korea had reported a total of 893 cases, the second most in the world. Of the 60 new cases reported by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 49 came from Daegu, the center of the outbreak in that country.\n\nIn Iran, a spike in coronavirus infections has prompted fears of a contagion throughout the Middle East. In Italy, one of Europe's largest economies, officials are struggling to prevent the epidemic from paralyzing the commercial center of Milan. And in New York, London, and Tokyo, financial markets plummeted on fears that the virus will cripple the global economy.\n\nThe emergence of Italy, Iran, and South Korea as new hubs of the outbreak underscored the lack of a coordinated global strategy to combat the coronavirus, which has infected nearly 80,000 people in 37 countries, causing at least 2,600 deaths.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 80,000 people in China and 33 other countries.\n\nC.D.C. warns Americans against traveling to South Korea.\n\nAmerican citizens were advised on Monday to avoid nonessential travel to South Korea because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus there. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has raised the travel warning to Level Three, its highest warning.\n\n\"There is a widespread, ongoing outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new) coronavirus that can be spread from person to person,\" the C.D.C. said in an advisory. \"Older adults and people with chronic medical conditions may be at risk of severe disease.\"\n\nThe C.D.C. also warned that \"there is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.\"\n\nThe warning came as South Korea reported Tuesday that the number of cases in the country had risen by 60 to 893 overall. The majority of the cases have been centered in the area in and around Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city, 180 miles southeast of Seoul. And roughly half the patients in the country are members of the Shincheonji religious group, a church that has a large following in the city.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in on Sunday put the country on the highest possible alert in its fight against the coronavirus.\n\nWhite House asks Congress for $2.5 billion to fight the outbreak.\n\nThe Trump administration, after weeks of pleading from lawmakers, asked Congress on Monday to allocate at least $2.5 billion in emergency funds to bolster its coronavirus response, according to three White House officials and a request letter obtained by The New York Times.\n\nThe request from the White House, $1.25 billion in new funds and $1.25 billion in money diverted from other federal programs, is a significant escalation in the administration's response to the outbreak of the virus and a sign of how long the fight to stop it may be.\n\nThe letter, which was signed by Russell T. Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the funds would be spent on emergency medical supplies, lab testing, the development of vaccines and other forms of monitoring, among other features.\n\nRepresentative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, called the request \"woefully insufficient to protect Americans from the deadly coronavirus outbreak.\"\n\n\"It is profoundly disturbing that their answer now is to raid money Congress has designated for other critical public health priorities,\" she said in a statement. \"Worse still, their overall request still falls short of what is needed for an effective, comprehensive government-wide response.\"\n\nA judge prevented California from moving some patients.\n\nIn a decision that could complicate California's efforts to deal with the coronavirus crisis, a federal judge on Monday kept a temporary restraining order in place that would prevent infected patients on a military base from being moved to a state-owned facility in the city of Costa Mesa.\n\nThe judge said she would reconsider the issue after state and federal authorities provide more details about how they plan to protect the health of the community, as well as the people with coronavirus. \"The state has shown great empathy for the patients,\" Judge Josephine L. Staton said in a ruling that drew applause, adding that she wanted to see \"the same empathy for the residents of Costa Mesa.\"\n\nCosta Mesa had asked the judge to prevent California from moving people infected with the new coronavirus into a former residential home for developmentally disabled people, where the patients would remain in isolation while recovering. The area, which is in Orange County, is too heavily populated to host people infected with such a dangerous virus, the local officials argued.\n\nFederal officials had planned to move the patients to a facility in Alabama operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, court documents said, but officials in California thought that moving the group out of the state would be detrimental to their health and well-being.\n\nThe standoff over where to send the patients underscored the unwieldy, decentralized nature of the U.S. health system, even as federal authorities were warning of serious risks from the coronavirus outbreak\n\nReporting and research was contributed by Matt Phillips, Russell Goldman, Keith Bradsher, Gerry Mullaney, Aimee Ortiz, Mark Landler, Steven Lee Myers,

Updates: New Unexplained Cases Reported in the U.S.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus newsletter.\n\nHere's what you need to know:New cases in three U.S. states raise prospect of local, person-to-person spread.Markets slide as the virus spreads across the globe.South Korea reports 594 new cases, and North calls for an all-out containment effort.For companies, how bad can it get?The White House is controlling the message. Historians say that is a bad idea.New cases in three U.S. states raise prospect of local, person-to-person spread.\n\nTroubling new signs of how the coronavirus is spreading in the United States emerged on Friday, as cases not explained by overseas travel or contact with a person known to be infected were reported in California, Oregon and Washington State.\n\nOfficials from the three states announced that their testing had found new cases: a high school student from Washington State; an employee of a school in Oregon, near Portland; and a woman in Santa Clara County, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley.\n\nSixty-five cases of the virus have been reported in the United States, but until this week, all of them could be explained by overseas travel or contact with someone who had been ill. The three new cases on Friday, and a case earlier in the week, in California, were the first in the United States in which the cause was mysterious and unknown -- a sign, experts warned, that the virus might now be spreading in this country.\n\n\"If we were worried yesterday, we are even more worried today,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \"Now we have to ask: How widely, really widely, is this virus out there?\"\n\nAs word emerged of the unexplained cases, local officials scrambled to trace everyone who had come in contact with those who were ill. California health officials said they were increasing testing. And in Washington State, officials suggested that people needed to prepare for the possibility of schools closing and businesses keeping workers home.\n\n\"We're going to be increasingly recommending that people try and avoid crowds and close contact with other people,\" Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health Seattle & King County, said. \"We may get to a point where we want to recommend canceling large public gatherings -- social events, sporting events, entertainment -- until we get over a hump of what might be a large outbreak.\"\n\nMarkets slide as the virus spreads across the globe.\n\nStocks tumbled for a seventh consecutive day on Friday, recording the market's worst week since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe S&P 500 index fell about 0.8 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 1 percent. The S&P index lost more than 11 percent in the week, and almost 13 percent since its peak on Feb. 19.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for elderly family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak.\n\nThe sell-off was fueled mostly by worry that measures to contain the coronavirus would hamper corporate profits and economic growth, and fears that the outbreak could get worse. The selling has in a matter of days dragged stock benchmarks around the world into a correction -- a drop of 10 percent or more that is taken as a measure of extreme pessimism.\n\nIn Europe, the Britain's FTSE 100 fell more than 3 percent and the Dax in Germany fell more than 4 percent. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Japan closed down 3.7 percent, the KOSPI in South Korea dropped 3.3 percent and the Shanghai Composite in China dropped 3.7 percent.\n\nSouth Korea reports 594 new cases, and North calls for an all-out containment effort.\n\nSouth Korea, which has the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China, reported 594 new cases on Saturday morning, bringing its total to 2,931. In North Korea, Kim Jong-un ordered all-out efforts to fight the virus at a high-level meeting, state media reported.\n\nSouth Korean officials have warned that confirmed cases would rise sharply as they aggressively tested thousands of people, particularly in the southeastern city of Daegu. More than 86 percent of patients have been in Daegu and nearby towns; many have been associated with a church called Shincheonji, which has a strong presence in Daegu.\n\nThe United States military, which has more than 28,000 personnel in South Korea, said on Saturday that the spouse of an American soldier infected with the virus had also tested positive for it. She had been in self-quarantine since Wednesday, following her husband's diagnosis, and was being transported to a military hospital, the military said.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Mr. Kim, North Korea's leader, convened the Politburo of his ruling party to order an all-out campaign to prevent an outbreak, state media reported. The North has not reported any coronavirus cases, but there has been concern that the secretive, totalitarian country could be hiding an outbreak.\n\n\"In case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences,\" the North's official Korean Central News Agency quoted Mr. Kim as saying. It said that officials had discussed \"measures to deter the influx and spread of the infectious disease in a scientific, preemptive and lockdown way.\"\n\nNorth Korea has already closed its 930-mile border with China, where the coronavirus emerged, and its border with Russia. But the Chinese border has long been porous for smugglers, who ferry goods across the shallow river that separates the countries. The North has also suspended all flights and trains to and from China and asked all foreign diplomats not to leave their compounds.\n\nThe state media report Saturday also said that Mr. Kim had fired one of his top aides, Ri Man-gon, and another official for corruption, but it was unclear whether the dismissals were connected to the antivirus campaign.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 85,100 people in at least 56 countries.\n\nFor companies, how bad can it get?\n\nAs the coronavirus outbreak spreads, the world's biggest companies have begun painting a bleak picture of broken supply chains, disrupted manufacturing, empty stores and flagging demand for their wares.\n\nThe announcements by businesses like Mastercard, Microsoft, Apple and United Airlines offer a look at how the virus is affecting consumer behavior and business sentiment. These corporate bulletins -- and what executives do in response -- could determine how much economic damage the outbreak inflicts.\n\nSome companies have expressed optimism that governments will curb new infections and that consumer spending in Europe and North America will be largely unscathed. But if executives see a threat beyond the first three months of the year, they may pare planned investments and even lay off workers.\n\nThe stock-market plunge this week, the steepest since the financial crisis, suggests that investors are bracing for a bad news.\n\n\"Everything is slowing down even more -- and that has not been fully appreciated,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.\n\nThe White House is controlling the message. Historians say that is a bad idea.\n\nMany times in many countries, political leaders have tried to censor health officials and play down the risks of infection just as epidemics approached. This strategy has almost never worked, historians and former health officials said.\n\nAnd if there are more deaths than leaders predict, stonewalling destroys the reputations of the leaders themselves.\n\nThis week's efforts to reorganize the Trump administration's chaotic response to the coronavirus outbreak risk falling into that pattern. The White House will coordinate all messaging, the public was told, and scientists in the government will not be popping up on television talk shows, saying what they think.\n\nThat may not be a winning strategy, experts warned. The stock market reacts to rumors, and the Federal Reserve Bank may succumb to political pressure. But pathogens, like hurricanes and tsunamis, are immune to spin.\n\n\"It's crucially important that experts tell the public what they know and when they know it,\" said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"That's the only way to earn and maintain the public trust that is essential to work together as a society and fight an epidemic.\"\n\nAs China awakened to the crisis, one community was left vulnerable.\n\nWhen the coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, residents in a nearby suburb thought they were safe. Zuoling New Town, a bustling community of retired farmers, factory workers and white-collar professionals, was 22 miles from the market where the outbreak appeared to have started.\n\nBut as the virus spread, Zuoling emerged as a stubborn hot spot of infections, and a somber lesson in how the state's effort to contain the virus left some communities vulnerable. The leadership's top-down campaign relied on grass-roots mobilization, and the very newness and isolation of Zuoling proved to be a weakness, depriving residents of food supplies, medical care and labor.\n\nResidents crammed into the only large supermarket to stock up. Those worried about fevers crowded the local clinic, and many were sent back to their high-rise homes, sometimes spreading the virus. The nearest public hospital assigned to take patients was 10 miles away, making it difficult to get treatment without a car.\n\n\"I never imagined that this would hit our home,\" said Zhang Jin, a 47-year-old resident. His mother, Yan Yinzhen, who was living with him, contracted what doctors believed was the coronavirus, possibly from a neighbor. Mr. Zhang, his wife and father all fell ill.\n\n\"We've lost confidence,\" said Mr. Zhang, a school bus driver. \"Nobody in the neighborhood took charge.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Peter Eavis, Donald G.

"body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- Federal health employees interacted with Americans quarantined for possible exposure to the coronavirus without proper medical training or protective gear, then scattered into the general population, according to a government whistle-blower.\n\nIn a portion of a complaint filing obtained by The New York Times that has been submitted to the Office of the Special Counsel, the whistle-blower, described as a senior leader at the health agency, said the team was \"improperly deployed\" to two military bases in California to assist the processing of Americans who had been evacuated from coronavirus hot zones in China and elsewhere.\n\nThe staff members were sent to Travis Air Force Base and March Air Reserve Base and were ordered to enter quarantined areas, including a hangar where coronavirus evacuees were being received. They were not provided training in safety protocols until five days later, the person said.\n\nWithout proper training or equipment, some of the exposed staff members moved freely around and off the bases, with at least one person staying in a nearby hotel and leaving California on a commercial flight. Many were unaware of the need to test their temperature three times a day.\n\n\"I soon began to field panicked calls from my leadership team and deployed staff members expressing concerns with the lack of H.H.S. communication and coordination, staff being sent into quarantined areas without personal protective equipment, training or experience in managing public health emergencies, safety protocols and the potential danger to both themselves and members of the public they come into contact with,\" the whistle-blower wrote.\n\nThe account surfaced after President Trump sought to play down the danger of a domestic coronavirus outbreak amid bipartisan concern about a sluggish and disjointed response by the administration to an illness that public health officials have said is likely to spread through the United States. The first American case of coronavirus in a patient with no known contact with hot zones or other coronavirus patients emerged near Travis Air Force Base this week.\n\nThe whistle-blower's account raised questions about whether the Trump administration has taken adequate precautions in its handling of the virus to date, and whether Mr. Trump's minimization of the risks has been mirrored by other top officials when confronted with potentially disturbing developments.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for eldery family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak.\n\nIn the complaint, the whistle-blower painted a grim portrait of agency staff members who found themselves on the front lines of a frantic federal effort to confront the coronavirus in the United States without any preparation or training, and whose own health concerns were dismissed by senior administration officials as detrimental to staff \"morale.\" They were \"admonished,\" the complaint said, and \"accused of not being team players,\" and had their \"mental health and emotional stability questioned.\"\n\nAfter a phone call with health agency leaders to raise their fears about exposure to the virus, the staff members described a \"whitewashing\" of the situation, characterizing the response as \"corrupt\" and a \"cover-up,\" according to the complaint, and telling the whistle-blower that senior officials had treated them as a \"nuisance\" and did not want to hear their worries about health and safety.\n\nRepresentative Jimmy Gomez, Democrat of California, whose office received the complaint, appeared to allude to it on Thursday morning at a hearing with Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of Health and Human Services, in the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Gomez was contacted by the whistle-blower, whom he had met before his congressional service, in part because his committee has jurisdiction over the health agency.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Gomez had a tense exchange with the secretary in which he suggested that staff from the Administration for Children and Families had been exposed to the virus without the requisite training and equipment, and then dispersed elsewhere in the United States.\n\n\"To your knowledge, were any of the ACF employees exposed to high-risk evacuees from China?\" Mr. Gomez asked Mr. Azar.\n\n\"They should never have been, without appropriate PPE,\" Mr. Azar responded, using the abbreviation for personal protective equipment, the term used for special suits designed to protect against infection. \"If you were anyone in quarantine, to maintain quarantine, that should be the case.\"\n\nMr. Gomez said his understanding was that the teams sent to March and Travis air bases faced a \"chaotic\" situation.\n\n\"I would not accept your proposition that it was chaotic at all times,\" Mr. Azar said. \"I am not aware of any violation of quarantine or isolation protocols.\"\n\n\"Do you think that breaking basic protocols and exposing untrained human service employees to the coronavirus before allowing them to be dispersed around the country could have endangered the employees and other Americans?\"\n\n\"I don't believe that has taken place,\" Mr. Azar replied.\n\nThe complaint, which was reported by The Washington Post, surfaced the day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first known instance of a person testing positive without exposure to anyone known to be infected with the coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, or recent travels to any of the countries where it is circulating. The C.D.C. said that it was possible the patient, who is a resident of Solano County, Calif. -- home to Travis Air Force Base -- could have been exposed to a returning traveler who was infected.\n\nMarch Air Reserve Base in Riverside, Calif., housed 195 people evacuated from Wuhan, China, for 14 days beginning in late January, while Travis in Northern California has housed a number of quarantined people in recent weeks, including some of the approximately 400 Americans on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that had docked in Japan.\n\nThe staff members, who had some experience with emergency management coordination, were woefully underprepared for the mission they were given, according to the whistle-blower.\n\n\"They were not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation,\" the official wrote. \"They were potentially exposed to coronavirus; appropriate measures were not taken to protect the staff from potential infection; and appropriate steps were not taken to quarantine, monitor or test them during their deployment and upon their return home.\"\n\nSome of the staff raised concerns with top officials with the agency, but saw no changes. The whistle-blower said they complained to Charles Keckler, an associate deputy secretary at Health and Human Services, in an email on Feb. 10. After the email, the complaint said, top officials, including Lynn Johnson, the assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, \"admitted that they did not understand their mission,\" and that her agency \"broke protocols\" because of the \"unprecedented crisis\" and an \"'all hands on deck' call to action\" by Dr. Robert Kadlec, the top official for public health emergencies and disasters.\n\nSince learning of the whistle-blower's concerns last Wednesday, Mr. Gomez's office and officials with the Ways and Means Committee have repeatedly pressed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for details. The whistle-blower has also notified the C.D.C. and the health agency inspector general about the concerns.\n\nRepresentative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the complaint appeared to be part of a pattern of ineptitude and mistrust of civil servants by the Trump administration.\n\n\"The president has spent years assaulting our health care system, draining resources from key health programs, and showing utter disdain for career federal employees who are the backbone of our government,\" Mr. Neal said in a statement provided to The Times. \"It's sadly no surprise we're seeing this degree of ineptitude during a terrible crisis.\"", "source": {"uri":

"Opinion | When a Pandemic Meets a Personality Cult", "body": "So, here's the response of the Trump team and its allies to the coronavirus, at least so far: It's actually good for America. Also, it's a hoax perpetrated by the news media and the Democrats. Besides, it's no big deal, and people should buy stocks. Anyway, we'll get it all under control under the leadership of a man who doesn't believe in science.\n\nFrom the day Donald Trump was elected, some of us worried how his administration would deal with a crisis not of its own making. Remarkably, we've gone three years without finding out: Until now, every serious problem facing the Trump administration, from trade wars to confrontation with Iran, has been self-created. But the coronavirus is looking as if it might be the test we've been fearing.\n\nAnd the results aren't looking good.\n\nThe story of the Trump pandemic response actually began several years ago. Almost as soon as he took office, Trump began cutting funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leading in turn to an 80 percent cut in the resources the agency devotes to global disease outbreaks. Trump also shut down the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council.\n\nExperts warned that these moves were exposing America to severe risks. \"We'll leave the field open to microbes,\" declared Tom Frieden, a much-admired former head of the C.D.C., more than two years ago. But the Trump administration has a preconceived notion about where national security threats come from -- basically, scary brown people -- and is hostile to science in general. So we entered the current crisis in an already weakened condition.\n\nAnd the microbes came.\n\nThe first reaction of the Trumpers was to see the coronavirus as a Chinese problem -- and to see whatever is bad for China as being good for us. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, cheered it on as a development that would \"accelerate the return of jobs to North America.\"\n\nThe story changed once it became clear that the virus was spreading well beyond China. At that point it became a hoax perpetrated by the news media. Rush Limbaugh weighed in: \"It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump. Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus. ... The coronavirus is the common cold, folks.\"\n\nLimbaugh was, you may not be surprised to hear, projecting. Back in 2014 right-wing politicians and media did indeed try to politically weaponize a disease outbreak, the Ebola virus, with Trump himself responsible for more than 100 tweets denouncing the Obama administration's response (which was actually competent and effective).\n\nAnd in case you're wondering, no, the coronavirus isn't like the common cold. In fact, early indications are that the virus may be as lethal as the 1918 Spanish Flu, which killed as many as 50 million people.\n\nFinancial markets evidently don't agree that the virus is a hoax; by Thursday afternoon the Dow was off more than 3,000 points since last week. Falling markets appear to worry the administration more than the prospect of, you know, people dying. So Larry Kudlow, the administration's top economist, made a point of declaring that the virus was \"contained\" -- contradicting the C.D.C. -- and suggested that Americans buy stocks. The market continued to drop.\n\nAt that point the administration appears to have finally realized that it might need to do something beyond insisting that things were great. But according to The Washington Post's Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman, it initially proposed paying for a virus response by cutting aid to the poor -- specifically, low-income heating subsidies. Cruelty in all things.\n\nOn Wednesday Trump held a news conference on the virus, much of it devoted to incoherent jabs at Democrats and the media. He did, however, announce the leader of the government response to the threat. Instead of putting a health care professional in charge, however, he handed the job to Vice President Mike Pence, who has an interesting relationship with both health policy and science.\n\nEarly in his political career, Pence staked out a distinctive position on public health, declaring that smoking doesn't kill people. He has also repeatedly insisted that evolution is just a theory. As governor of Indiana, he blocked a needle exchange program that could have prevented a significant H.I.V. outbreak, calling for prayer instead.\n\nAnd now, according to The Times, government scientists will need to get Pence's approval before making public statements about the coronavirus.\n\nSo the Trumpian response to crisis is completely self-centered, entirely focused on making Trump look good rather than protecting America. If the facts don't make Trump look good, he and his allies attack the messengers, blaming the news media and the Democrats -- while trying to prevent scientists from keeping us informed. And in choosing people to deal with a real crisis, Trump prizes loyalty rather than competence.\n\nMaybe Trump -- and America -- will be lucky, and this won't be as bad as it might be. But anyone feeling confident right now isn't paying attention.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Outbreak\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus newsletter.\n\nFrank Wucinski and his 3-year-old daughter, Annabel, are among the dozens of Americans that the government has flown back to the country from Wuhan, China, and put under quarantine to check for signs of coronavirus.\n\nNow they are among what could become a growing number of families hit with surprise medical bills related to government-mandated actions.\n\nMr. Wucinski, a Pennsylvania native who has lived in China for years, accepted the U.S. government's offer to evacuate from Wuhan with Annabel in early February as the new coronavirus spread. His wife, who is not an American citizen and remains in China, developed pneumonia that doctors think resulted from Covid-19, the disease caused by the respiratory virus. Her father, whom she helped care for, was infected and recently died.\n\nThe first stop for Mr. Wucinski and Annabel was a two-week quarantine at Marine Corps Station Miramar near San Diego. During that time, they had two mandatory stays in an isolation unit at a nearby children's hospital. The first started upon arrival in the United States, and the second was a few days later, after an official heard Annabel coughing.\n\n\"The hospital staff were very nice, they brought us a lot of toys,\" Mr. Wucinski said. \"Each time it was three or four days. I love my daughter to death, but being in the same room that long, she is not a great conversationalist.\"\n\nBoth have repeatedly tested negative for the virus.\n\nAfter their release from quarantine, Mr. Wucinski and his daughter went to stay with his mother in Harrisburg, Pa. That's where they found a pile of medical bills waiting: $3,918 in charges from hospital doctors, radiologists and an ambulance company.\n\n\"I assumed it was all being paid for,\" Mr. Wucinski said. \"We didn't have a choice. When the bills showed up it was just a pit in my stomach, like how do I pay for this?\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for elderly family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak.\n\nMr. Wucinski's employer, a standardized testing company, did provide health benefits when he lived in China but does not offer coverage in the United States.\n\nPatients in the United States regularly confront surprise medical bills that are hard to decode. Mr. Wucinski's case suggests that those held in mandatory isolation for suspected coronavirus may be no exception.\n\nThe federal government does have the authority to quarantine and isolate patients whom officials believe to be a public health threat. These powers, which date back to cholera outbreaks among ship passengers in the late 19th century, are rarely used. They don't say anything about who pays when the isolation happens in a nongovernmental medical facility -- or when they're brought there by a private ambulance company.\n\n\"There is no uniform practice,\" said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. \"They do have the powers, but they've almost never used them in modern times.\"\n\nWhile the number of patients held in mandatory isolation is currently small, it is likely to grow if the coronavirus continues to spread across the United States. Eleven cases were confirmed in San Antonio on Friday evening. Earlier in the day, public health authorities identified a second case in California and a first in Oregon where patients who had not traveled to an affected country became infected.\n\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman declined to comment on whether it would pay the bills of patients kept in mandatory isolation.\n\nMr. Gostin worries that high charges for mandatory isolation could make patients wary of seeking needed medical treatment.\n\n\"The most important rule of public health is to gain the cooperation of the population,\" he said. \"There are legal, moral and public health reasons not to charge the patients.\"\n\nThese hospital stays could prove expensive. The International Federation of Health Plans estimates that the average day in a U.S. hospital costs $4,293, compared with $1,308 in Australia and $481 in Spain. They may be especially costly for patients without health insurance or those who have large deductibles, which they must pay before their health benefits kick in.\n\nMr. Wucinski recalls other patients asking questions about how medical bills would be handled during daily town hall meetings for those quarantined at the Marine Corps station. He felt the answers weren't clear.\n\nHe did receive a document upon leaving quarantine, directing him to contact a government email address with any medical bills. He sent an email on Feb. 24 detailing the charges and asking what would be done.\n\n\"My question, is why are we being charged for these stays, if they were mandatory and we had no choice in the matter?\" Mr. Wucinski wrote in his message.\n\nHis email has not yet received a response, he said. When contacted by The New York Times, a Rady Children's Hospital spokesman said that the bill from their physicians had been sent in error and that the family would not be held responsible for the charges.\n\n\"We're in the process of assessing how the error occurred,\" the spokesman, Benjamin Metcalf, said. \"We are working with government agencies regarding billing for these cases.\"\n\nBut the hospital bill only represented a fraction of those the family received.\n\nThe ambulance company that transported the Wucinskis, American Medical Response, charged the family $2,598 for taking them to the hospital. A company representative declined to comment on the bill \"due to patient privacy concerns,\" but said the company would look into the case.\n\nAn additional $90 in charges came from radiologists who read the patients' X-ray scans and do not work for the hospital. Having such doctors, who may be outside a patient's insurance networks, provide services to hospital patients is one of the major causes of surprise medical bills.\n\nThe radiologists' employer, San Diego Medical Imaging Group, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Wucinski is looking into whether he or his daughter might qualify for Medicaid, the public insurance program that covers low-income Americans. Some news outlets have seized on the fact that he coughed enough on a recent television interview to require water.\n\nMr. Wucinski recently noticed that his daughter is blinking a lot and hopes to get the issue examined by a doctor, but is worried about the charges they may face. He has wondered whether the stress of the past month and the separation from her mother has played a role.\n\n\"I should take her to the doctor this week for a checkup, but we don't have insurance, so it's just going to have to be cash,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_kliff@nytimes.com", "name": "Sarah

American soldier in South Korea has tested positive for the new coronavirus, the U.S. military said on Wednesday.\n\nThe patient, a 23-year-old man, is based in Camp Carroll in Waegwan, only 12 miles from Daegu, the South Korean city at the center of an outbreak in the country.\n\nThe soldier, the first U.S. service member to become infected, has been quarantined in his off-base residence, the military said.\n\nThe soldier visited Camp Walker, a military base in Daegu, on Monday and visited Camp Carroll from Friday to Tuesday.\n\nSouth Korean and American \"health professionals are actively conducting contact tracing to determine whether any others may have been exposed,\" the military said.\n\nThe military added that it was \"implementing all appropriate control measures to help control the spread of Covid-19 and remains at risk level 'high'\" for all its 28,500 soldiers stationed in South Korea \"as a prudent measure to protect the force.\"\n\nThe U.S. military in South Korea elevated its risk level to \"high\" on Monday, advising all troops to \"limit non-mission essential\" meetings and \"off-installation travel.\" At gates of the American military bases across South Korea, soldiers are being given temperature checks and screening questionnaires.\n\nOn Tuesday, the United States and South Korea said they would consider scaling back joint military exercise after an outbreak among South Korean soldiers had infected at least 13.\n\nSouth Korea reported 169 new patients on Wednesday, bringing the total number to 1,146, the biggest outbreak outside China. More than half of the patients were residents of Daegu.\n\nTwo European hotels are locked down as new cases spread across the Continent.\n\nA second European hotel was put on lockdown on Wednesday, as coronavirus infections spread across the Continent.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 25, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nThe World Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world is not ready for a major outbreak. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all non-essential travel to South Korea and China. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nThe authorities in Innsbruck, an Austrian ski town in the Alps, sealed off the 108-room Grand Hotel after an Italian employee there tested positive for the virus. The cordon was the second at a European hotel in two days, after Spain on Tuesday cordoned off the H10 Costa Adeje Palace on the resort island of Tinorefe after a guest, also from Italy, tested positive.\n\nEach of the infected Italians had recently visited the Lombardy region of the country.\n\nThough the virus originated in China, an outbreak in Italy has given it a foothold in Europe from which it has rapidly spread to at least five countries.\n\nSpain, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland and France all reported cases linked to Lombardy on Tuesday.\n\nThe spread in Europe mirrored outbreaks in the Middle East, particularly Iran, and Asia, where the death toll in South Korea is rapidly mounting.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 81,600 people in China and 38 other countries.\n\nHong Kong proposes cash handouts to help with economic pain of outbreak and protests.\n\nHong Kong will give each adult permanent resident close to $1,300 this year, part of an effort to help a faltering economy and ease some of the financial pain caused by months of protests and the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHong Kong entered a recession in the second half of last year, with the economy contracting 1.2 percent, the first annual decline since 2009.\n\nPaul Chan, Hong Kong's financial secretary, said the city would implement $15 billion in new spending and tax breaks as part of a new budget put forward Wednesday. The cash disbursement will go to about seven million people and cost around $9 billion, Mr. Chan said.\n\nMr. Chan said the handout involved \"a huge sum of public money,\" adding that it was an exceptional measure that he did not believe would impose a long-term burden on the city's finances, with about $140 billion in fiscal reserves.\n\nUnder the proposed budget, Hong Kong will also cut salaries taxes for about two million workers by up to $2,500 per person, a measure that would cut revenues by about $2.4 billion, he said.\n\nThe government had previously announced a $3.8 billion fund to help fight the new coronavirus and aid small businesses harmed by the outbreak. Hong Kong has 85 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections, and two deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nDespite such stimulus measures, Mr. Chan offered a sobering picture for Hong Kong's economy in the coming year, with estimates ranging from a 1.5 percent contraction to 0.5 percent growth.\n\nAsian stocks fall in early trading, following Wall Street.\n\nAsian stock markets followed Wall Street lower on Wednesday, as alarm continued to grow among global investors that the newly emerged coronavirus would continue to spread and hurt global economic growth.\n\nShare prices in Japan and in South Korea both were down about 1 percent at midday on Wednesday. The South Korean authorities have confirmed more than 1,100 cases, prompting the United States to warn its citizens about travel there.\n\nThe Shanghai stock market fell 1.1 percent in early trading on Wednesday but rebounded and was up slightly at midday. There are signs that some economic activity is resuming in coastal China cities, where few cases of the virus have been reported lately.\n\nThe Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong was also down about 0.5 percent midday.\n\nThe Australian stock market slumped on Wednesday for the third day in a row, dropping more than 2 percent in Sydney.\n\nThe declines in Asian markets came after the S.&P. 500 index in the United States extended its steep slide this week by falling 3 percent on Tuesday. Investors in the United States and Asia appeared to be disheartened by developments that included a warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that clusters of cases in the United States were \"inevitable.\"\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note also fell to a record low on Tuesday, an indication that investors may expect American economic growth to falter.\n\nIn China, pregnant women face a sudden shortage of health care.\n\nPregnant women in China are facing an emergency they could hardly have imagined a few months ago: The doctors and hospitals they were relying on are suddenly unavailable.\n\nThe government has taken nurses and doctors away from their usual jobs and assigned them to work on the coronavirus outbreak. That has left many small community hospitals, where prenatal care and childbirth are often handled, so understaffed that they have closed temporarily.\n\nMany pregnant women have been unable to find even basic care, while reports of infected mothers giving birth have heightened fears of passing on the virus to newborns -- though there is no evidence of such transmission.\n\nIn Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, pregnant women have struggled to figure out where they can give birth. Not only are hospitals closed, so is the public transit system, and residents are not allowed to leave the city.\n\n\"I worry every day about whether my child will die in my belly,\" said Jane Huang. \"I worry if there is an early delivery, it will not be able to survive.\"\n\nWomen who have given birth in China since the epidemic began say they have received minimal care in short-handed hospitals. Regular checkups for babies have been postponed, and mothers have been unable to get their infants vaccinated.\n\nExperts say the situation is undercutting the major political effort in recent years to prod Chinese women to have more children amid historically low birthrates and a looming demographic crisis.\n\nReporting was contributed by Russell Goldman, Choe Sang-Hun, Keith Bradsher, Austin

"body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- Federal health employees interacted with Americans quarantined for possible exposure to the coronavirus without proper medical training or protective gear, then scattered into the general population, according to a government whistle-blower.\n\nIn a portion of a complaint filing obtained by The New York Times that has been submitted to the Office of the Special Counsel, the whistle-blower, described as a senior leader at the health agency, said the team was \"improperly deployed\" to two military bases in California to assist the processing of Americans who had been evacuated from coronavirus hot zones in China and elsewhere.\n\nThe staff members were sent to Travis Air Force Base and March Air Reserve Base and were ordered to enter quarantined areas, including a hangar where coronavirus evacuees were being received. They were not provided training in safety protocols until five days later, the person said.\n\nWithout proper training or equipment, some of the exposed staff members moved freely around and off the bases, with at least one person staying in a nearby hotel and leaving California on a commercial flight. Many were unaware of the need to test their temperature three times a day.\n\n\"I soon began to field panicked calls from my leadership team and deployed staff members expressing concerns with the lack of H.H.S. communication and coordination, staff being sent into quarantined areas without personal protective equipment, training or experience in managing public health emergencies, safety protocols and the potential danger to both themselves and members of the public they come into contact with,\" the whistle-blower wrote.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged the complaint without elaborating.\n\n\"We take all whistle-blower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act,\" said Caitlin B.

How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for eldery family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak.\n\nThe account surfaced after President Trump sought to play down the danger of a domestic coronavirus outbreak amid bipartisan concern about a sluggish and disjointed response by the administration to an illness that public health officials have said is likely to spread through the United States. The first American case of coronavirus in a patient with no known contact with hot zones or other coronavirus patients emerged near Travis Air Force Base this week.\n\nThe whistle-blower's account raised questions about whether the Trump administration has taken adequate precautions in its handling of the virus to date, and whether Mr. Trump's minimization of the risks has been mirrored by other top officials when confronted with potentially disturbing developments.\n\nSimilar episodes appear to have happened elsewhere. Employees with the Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families were also dispatched to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to help other evacuees from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, someone with direct knowledge of the effort said.\n\nIt was the first time to his knowledge that employees of the family administration had ever dealt with a federal quarantine. Employees of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention appeared to have one set of guidance. Other employees of the Health and Human Services Department operated under a different protocol.\n\nThe levels of protection varied even while he was at Miramar, he said. Standards were more lax at first, but once people arrived who appeared to be sick, workers began donning personal protective equipment. He is now back at work, and has yet to be tested for coronavirus exposure.\n\nIn the complaint, the whistle-blower painted a grim portrait of agency staff members who found themselves on the front lines of a frantic federal effort to confront the coronavirus in the United States without any preparation or training, and whose own health concerns were dismissed by senior administration officials as detrimental to staff \"morale.\" They were \"admonished,\" the complaint said, and \"accused of not being team players,\" and had their \"mental health and emotional stability questioned.\"\n\nAfter a phone call with health agency leaders to raise their fears about exposure to the virus, the staff members described a \"whitewashing\" of the situation, characterizing the response as \"corrupt\" and a \"cover-up,\" according to the complaint, and telling the whistle-blower that senior officials had treated them as a \"nuisance\" and did not want to hear their worries about health and safety.\n\nRepresentative Jimmy Gomez, Democrat of California, whose office received the complaint, appeared to allude to it on Thursday morning at a hearing with Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of Health and Human Services, in the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Gomez was contacted by the whistle-blower, whom he had met before his congressional service, in part because his committee has jurisdiction over the health agency.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Gomez had a tense exchange with the secretary in which he suggested that staff from the Administration for Children and Families had been exposed to the virus without the requisite training and equipment, and then dispersed elsewhere in the United States.\n\n\"To your knowledge, were any of the ACF employees exposed to high-risk evacuees from China?\" Mr. Gomez asked Mr. Azar.\n\n\"They should never have been, without appropriate PPE,\" Mr. Azar responded, using the abbreviation for personal protective equipment, the term used for special suits designed to protect against infection. \"If you were anyone in quarantine, to maintain quarantine, that should be the case.\"\n\nMr. Gomez said his understanding was that the teams sent to March and Travis air bases faced a \"chaotic\" situation.\n\n\"I would not accept your proposition that it was chaotic at all times,\" Mr. Azar said. \"I am not aware of any violation of quarantine or isolation protocols.\"\n\n\"Do you think that breaking basic protocols and exposing untrained human service employees to the coronavirus before allowing them to be dispersed around the country could have endangered the employees and other Americans?\"\n\n\"I don't believe that has taken place,\" Mr. Azar replied.\n\nThe complaint, which was reported by The Washington Post, surfaced the day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first known instance of a person testing positive without exposure to anyone known to be infected with the coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, or recent travels to any of the countries where it is circulating. The C.D.C. said that it was possible the patient, who is a resident of Solano County, Calif. -- home to Travis Air Force Base -- could have been exposed to a returning traveler who was infected.\n\nMarch Air Reserve Base in Riverside, Calif., housed 195 people evacuated from Wuhan, China, for 14 days beginning in late January, while Travis in Northern California has housed a number of quarantined people in recent weeks, including some of the approximately 400 Americans on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that had docked in Japan.\n\nThe staff members, who had some experience with emergency management coordination, were woefully underprepared for the mission they were given, according to the whistle-blower.\n\n\"They were not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation,\" the official wrote. \"They were potentially exposed to coronavirus; appropriate measures were not taken to protect the staff from potential infection; and appropriate steps were not taken to quarantine, monitor or test them during their deployment and upon their return home.\"\n\nSome of the staff raised concerns with top officials with the agency, but saw no changes. The whistle-blower said they complained to Charles Keckler, an associate deputy secretary at Health and Human Services, in an email on Feb. 10. After the email, the complaint said, top officials, including Lynn Johnson, the assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, \"admitted that they did not understand their mission,\" and that her agency \"broke protocols\" because of the \"unprecedented crisis\" and an \"'all hands on deck' call to action\" by Dr. Robert Kadlec, the top official for public health emergencies and disasters.\n\nSince learning of the whistle-blower's concerns last Wednesday, Mr. Gomez's office and officials with the Ways and Means Committee have repeatedly pressed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for details. The whistle-blower has also notified the C.D.C. and the health agency inspector general about the concerns.\n\nRepresentative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the complaint appeared to be part of a pattern of ineptitude and mistrust of civil servants by the Trump administration.\n\n\"The president has spent years assaulting our health care system, draining resources from key health programs, and showing utter disdain for career federal employees who are the backbone of our government,\" Mr. Neal said in a statement provided to The Times. \"It's sadly no surprise we're seeing this degree of ineptitude during a terrible crisis.\"", "source": {"uri":

HILL, Md. -- Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, on Friday blamed the media for exaggerating the seriousness of coronavirus because \"they think this will bring down the president, that's what this is all about.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of conservative activists, Mr. Mulvaney played down concerns about the virus that is spreading around the globe and panicking investors.\n\nMr. Mulvaney said the administration took \"extraordinary steps four or five weeks ago,\" to prevent the spread of the virus when it declared a rare public health emergency and barred entry by most foreign nationals who had recently visited China.\n\n\"Why didn't you hear about it?\" Mr. Mulvaney said of travel restrictions that were widely covered in the news media. \"What was still going on four or five weeks ago? Impeachment, that's all the press wanted to talk about.\"\n\nThe news media has been covering the global spread of coronavirus for months.\n\nBut Mr. Mulvaney claimed that the news media was too preoccupied covering impeachment, he said, \"because they thought it would bring down the president.\"\n\nThe media's focus switched to the coronavirus for the same reason, he continued.\n\n\"The reason you're seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,\" he added. \"That's what this is all about it.\"\n\nFollowing the president's lead, Mr. Mulvaney also brushed off concerns over the virus; there have been 60 cases identified in the United States.\n\n\"The flu kills people,\" he said. \"This is not Ebola. It's not SARS, it's not MERS. It's not a death sentence, it's not the same as the Ebola crisis.\"\n\nMr. Mulvaney also criticized the news media for generally not wanting to portray Mr. Trump in a positive light. But he chose a bizarre example, claiming it refuses to cover what he described as Mr. Trump's loving relationship with his 13-year-old son, Barron.\n\nHe said Mr. Trump is in frequent contact with his youngest son, calling to check in on him and let him know of his whereabouts. But, Mr. Mulvaney said, \"the press would never show you that because it doesn't fit that image of him, the press wants him to be this terrible monster.\"\n\nMr. Mulvaney's decision to discuss Barron Trump was curious, especially when Melania Trump, the first lady, and senior White House officials have gone to great lengths to make sure he enjoys the privacy afforded to other children of presidents growing up in the uncomfortable spotlight of the White House. The White House press corps has generally agreed to grant Barron Trump the same privacy.\n\n\"He's huge, but he's still very young,\" Mr. Mulvaney said of Barron, who is sometimes seen boarding Air Force One with his parents, but who often departs the plane after his father to avoid being photographed. \"He was 10 or something like that when the president was elected.\"\n\nMr. Mulvaney, who was interviewed onstage by Stephen Moore, whose expected nomination by the president to the Federal Reserve Board was withdrawn over concerns about his treatment of women, also asserted that Mr. Trump did not sleep on the overnight plane trip home from India or during the day before his news conference on coronavirus Wednesday night.\n\n\"He said, 'I've only got eight years, I'm going to get as much out of it as I can,'\" Mr. Mulvaney said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "annie_karni@nytimes.com", "name": "Annie Karni",

They urged individuals to get themselves and their families ready. But what can you do?\n\nInfectious disease experts stressed that people should not panic and offered practical advice.\n\n\"The mantra is, 'Keep calm and carry on,'\" said Dr. Marguerite Neill, an infectious disease expert at Brown University.\n\nAnd use common sense, experts said.\n\n\"If you see someone on a bus who is coughing, move away,\" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, an infectious disease and coronavirus expert at the University of Iowa.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 25, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States.

How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nStay home from work if you are sick.\n\nWash your hands frequently, said Dr. Trish Perl, an infectious disease specialist at UT Southwestern Medical Center. \"It's not super sexy but it works,\" she said. With SARS, also a coronavirus, but one that is much deadlier, hand washing reduced the risk of transmission by 30 to 50 percent, she said.\n\nOf course, you should cough into your elbow and dispose of tissues in a wastebasket after you blow your nose. You should keep surfaces in your home clean. Alcohol is a good disinfectant for coronaviruses, Dr. Perl added.\n\nIt would be sensible to have a good supply of food staples and necessary medications.\n\n\"Don't wait until the last minute to refill your prescriptions,\" Dr. Neill said. \"You want to comfortably have at least a 30-day supply.\"\n\nWith household supplies, she said, make sure you have essentials on hand, like laundry detergent and, if you have small children, diapers, perhaps enough for a month.\n\nShe also suggested finding the website for your local health department so you will have a reliable source of news.\n\nInfectious disease specialists strongly recommended flu vaccines and, for older people, the vaccine against pneumococcal pneumonia, although, they added, neither influenza nor the bacterial pneumonia seem to affect a person's risk of getting a coronavirus infection or becoming seriously ill. But it is possible that the coronavirus, by injuring lung cells, can make it easier for pneumonia to take hold, Dr. Perl said. Avoiding the flu also means you won't take up the resources of a hospital and the time of health care workers in the event of a coronavirus outbreak.\n\nParents might want to contact their child's school system and find out how plans for early dismissals or online instruction would be implemented, should they be necessary.\n\nAnd people with elderly parents or relatives should plan for a support system in case they fall ill.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gina_kolata@nytimes.com", "name": "Gina Kolata",

outbreak with our daily Coronavirus newsletter.\n\nIs this new coronavirus really a serious threat? Doesn't the flu kill more people?\n\nAs the United States recorded its first coronavirus death on Saturday -- and as other cases popped up in people without known risks on the West Coast -- Americans wondered how to measure this new threat against a more familiar foe: influenza.\n\nPresident Trump, a self-described germophobe, said on Wednesday he was amazed to learn that tens of thousands of Americans died from the flu each year, contrasting that number with the 60 or so known to be infected with the coronavirus. On Friday, Mr. Trump accused the news media and Democrats of exaggerating the dangers of the virus.\n\n\"The flu kills people,\" Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said on Wednesday. \"This is not Ebola. It's not SARS, it's not MERS. It's not a death sentence.\"\n\nTo many public health officials, that argument misses the point.\n\nYes, the flu is terrible -- that's exactly why scientists don't want another contagious respiratory disease to take root. If they could stop the seasonal flu, they would. But there may yet be a chance to stop the coronavirus.\n\nIn many ways, the flu is the best argument for throwing everything at the coronavirus. Here's a closer look at the similarities and differences.\n\nWhich virus is deadlier?\n\nThe coronavirus seems to be more deadly than the flu -- so far.\n\nOn average, seasonal flu strains kill about 0.1 percent of people who become infected. The 1918 flu had an unusually high fatality rate, around 2 percent. Because it was so contagious, that flu killed tens of millions of people.\n\nEarly estimates of the coronavirus death rate from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, have been around 2 percent. But a new report on 1,099 cases from many parts of China, published on Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine, finds a lower rate: 1.4 percent.\n\nThe coronavirus death rate may be even lower, if -- as most experts suspect -- there are many mild or symptom-free cases that have not been detected.\n\nThe true death rate could turn out to be similar to that of a severe seasonal flu, below 1 percent, according to an editorial published in the journal by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. H. Clifford Lane, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut even a disease with a relatively low death rate can take a huge toll if enormous numbers of people catch it. As of Friday, there were 83,861 coronavirus cases and 2,867 deaths. This week, for the first time, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number within the country.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for elderly family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak. Which virus is more contagious?\n\nSo far, the new coronavirus seems to be more contagious than most strains of the flu, and roughly as contagious as strains that appear in pandemic flu seasons.\n\nEach person with the coronavirus appears to infect 2.2 other people, on average. But the figure is skewed by the fact that the epidemic was not managed well in the beginning, and infections soared in Wuhan and the surrounding province. As an epidemic comes under control, the reproduction number, as it's called, will fall.\n\nBy comparison, the figure for the seasonal flu is roughly 1.3. The reproduction number for the flu of 1918 was about the same as that of the new coronavirus, perhaps higher, but that was before modern treatments and vaccines were available.\n\nIn both flu and the illness caused by the coronavirus, people may be contagious before symptoms develop, making it difficult or even impossible to control the spread of the virus. Nobody knows how many people infected with the coronavirus have only very mild symptoms or are none at all.\n\nWho is most at risk from infection?\n\nBoth the coronavirus and influenza are most dangerous to people who are older than 65, or have chronic illnesses or a weak immune system.\n\nDeath rates among men infected with the coronavirus in China, particularly those in their late 40s and older, have exceeded those among women, a pattern not seen in the seasonal flu. The reason for the discrepancy is not known, although Chinese men do smoke more, often resulting in compromised lung function.\n\nThere seems to be another important difference: The flu appears far more dangerous to children, particularly very young ones, who can become severely ill. Children infected with the new coronavirus tend to have mild or no symptoms.\n\nThe flu is also especially dangerous for pregnant women, who can become severely ill from it. Whether the new coronavirus poses as serious a threat to pregnant women is not known.\n\nWhich virus makes you sicker?\n\nAs of Feb. 22, in the current season there were at least 32 million cases of flu in the United States, 310,000 hospitalizations and 18,000 flu deaths, according to the C.D.C. Hospitalization rates among children and young adults this year have been unusually high.\n\nThere would be even more illnesses and deaths if there were no flu vaccine. Most people recover in less than two weeks, and sometimes in just days.\n\nBy contrast, fewer than 70 people in the United States have been infected with the new coronavirus, and there have been no deaths. There are no treatments or vaccines for the coronavirus, only supportive care for infected people.\n\nMost cases of coronavirus infection are not severe, but some people do become quite sick. Data from the largest study of patients to date, conducted in China, suggests that of coronavirus patients receiving medical attention, 80 percent had mild infections, about 15 percent had severe illnesses, and 5 percent were critical.\n\nThe first symptoms, fever and cough, are similar to that of the flu, so the diseases can be hard to tell apart without a test to identify the virus. Pneumonia is common among coronavirus patients, even among those whose cases are not severe.\n\nExperts think there may also be many people with no symptoms at all, or such mild ones that they never bother to seek medical attention. Because those cases have not been counted, it's not possible now to know the real proportion of mild versus severe cases.\n\nAntibody tests, which can determine whether someone has ever been infected, may eventually help to establish how many people had mild or asymptomatic coronavirus infections.\n\nCan people become immune to the coronavirus?\n\nAfter viral infections, people generally develop antibodies in their blood that will fight off the virus and protect them from contracting it again. It's reasonable to assume that people who have had the new coronavirus will become immune to it.\n\nBut it is not known how long that immunity will last. With other coronaviruses, which cause the common cold, immunity can wane.\n\nThere are vaccines for the seasonal flu, of course, and these induce at least partial immunity to influenza.\n\nWhat treatments are available?\n\nThere is no approved antiviral drug for the coronavirus, though several are being tested. Doctors can recommend only the usual remedies for any viral illness: rest, medicine to reduce pain and fever, and fluids to avoid dehydration.\n\nCoronavirus patients with pneumonia may also need oxygen, and a ventilator if breathing trouble worsens.\n\nFor the flu, however, there are four prescription medicines. All work best if they are taken within a day or two of when symptoms start.\n\nThey're not miracle cures: They can lessen the severity of the illness and shorten its course by a day or so, and they may lower the risk of serious complications.\n\nThe drugs are also recommended for people who have been exposed to a flu patient, to try to prevent the illness.\n\nThe flu, like the Covid-19, can also lead to pneumonia and breathing trouble. Anyone who becomes short of breath needs medical attention quickly.\n\nCan I get vaccinated?\n\nAn experimental vaccine for the coronavirus may be ready for testing in humans within a few months, but will take much longer, at least a year or two, to become available for widespread use.\n\nFlu vaccines, on the other hand, are widely available and generally 40 percent to 60 percent effective, which means they will reduce cases by that amount in a population that has been vaccinated, compared with one that has not.\n\nThe vaccine for the current season falls into that range, according to the C.D.C., which said on Feb. 21 that people who have not been vaccinated should still get the shot, because the flu season is ongoing.\n\nExperts have been urging people to get the flu shot for all the usual reasons. But now there's another: If there is a coronavirus outbreak in the United States, hospitals will need all the beds, equipment and staff they can muster.\n\nIt will be important not to have those resources taken up by patients with flu that could have been prevented.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nWill the coronavirus go away when the weather warms?\n\nMr. Trump has said repeatedly that the coronavirus will retreat as weather warms, just as influenza does. In fact, because this is a new virus, there is no information about how the weather might affect it.\n\nEven if the virus were to diminish in the spring, it might rebound later in the fall, as the weather cools. This is a pattern often seen in severe flu seasons.\n\nContainment is becoming less likely, because of the contagiousness of the virus, the possibility that people can spread it before they have symptoms and the increasing number of outbreaks around the world.\n\nThe cases in California, Oregon and Washington State without known links to overseas travel, reported on Friday, may be a warning sign that the new coronavirus has already begun to circulate.\n\nReporting was contributed by Gina Kolata and Knvul Sheikh.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

"Coronavirus May Have Spread in U.S. for Weeks, Gene Sequencing Suggests", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus newsletter.\n\nResearchers who have examined the genomes of two coronavirus infections in Washington state say the similarities between the cases suggest that the virus may have been spreading in the state for weeks.\n\nWashington had the United States' first confirmed case of coronavirus, announced by the C.D.C. on Jan. 20. Based on an analysis of the virus's genetic sequence, another case that surfaced in the state and was announced on Friday probably was descended from that first case.\n\nThe two people live in the same county, but are not known to have had contact with one another, and the second case occurred well after the first would no longer be expected to be contagious. So the genetic findings suggest that the virus has been spreading through other people in the community for close to six weeks, according to one of the scientists who compared the sequences, Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington.\n\nDr. Bedford said it was possible that the two cases could be unrelated, and had been introduced separately into the United States. But he said that was unlikely, however, because in both cases the virus contained a genetic variation that is rare among samples collected in Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.\n\nA scientist who was not involved in the analysis said he agreed with the conclusion that the second case was connected to the original Washington case. \"I think he's right,\" said Andrew Rambaut, professor of molecular evolution at the University of Edinburgh, referring to Dr. Bedford. \"It's extremely unlikely that two viruses coming from outside the U.S.A. independently would arrive in the same geographical area and be genetically related unless they were connected.\"\n\nState and local health officials have been hamstrung in their ability to test widely for the coronavirus. Until very recently, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had insisted that only its test could be used, and only on patients who met specific criteria -- those who had traveled to China within 14 days of developing symptoms or had contact with a known coronavirus case.\n\nIf the virus has been spreading undetected in Washington since mid-January, that could mean that anywhere from 150 to 1,500 people may have it, with about 300 to 500 people the most likely range, said Dr. Mike Famulare, a principal research scientist at the Institute for Disease Modeling in Bellevue, Wa., who performed the analysis. These people \"have either been infected and recovered, or currently are infected now,\" he said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for elderly family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak.\n\nMany of those people would now be in the early stages of incubating the virus, and might not yet be contagious, Dr. Famulare said.\n\nDr. Famulare's estimate was based on a simulation using what scientists have learned about the incubation period and transmissibility of the virus. He called his figures a \"best guess, with broad uncertainty.\" Another method, based on the size of the local population, the number of tests performed and the proportion of those that were positive, produced similar estimates of how widely the virus may have spread in the community.\n\nThe scientists immediately reported the genomic sequence and their findings to state and federal health officials. The scientists said the had already been working closely with government health officials. \"There's an enormous collaborative spirit right now,\" Dr. Famulare said.\n\nNeither the C.D.C. nor the state or local health departments immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe first patient, a man in his 30s, has recovered after being treated in a hospital isolation unit. The later patient, a teenager, had a mild enough illness to recuperate at home.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Snohomish Health District, the teenager was unaware that he was being tested for the coronavirus. His case came to light on Friday because he went to a clinic to be tested for the flu, and his sample was shared with the Seattle Flu Study, which tested it for a variety of pathogens including the new coronavirus.\n\n\"I do think, as more community cases start popping up in the United States, this approach and technique could prove very useful to figuring out the extent of community transmission we currently are having,\" Dr. Bedford said of the genetic analysis.\n\nSimilar analyses have helped public health officials trace cases and fight outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nOn Saturday, local health officials in Seattle said that delays in being able to test for the virus had slowed identification of community cases, meaning those who did not travel to places with major outbreaks or have contact with known patients. \"If we had the ability to test earlier, I'm sure we would have been able to identify patients earlier,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County.\n\nThe genomic technique used to compare the viruses is akin to constructing a family tree. \"As a virus passes from person to person, there will be errors that occur\" as copies of the virus are made, Dr. Bedford said. To explain, he compared the tiny mutations in the genetic sequence to mistakes made during a game of telephone. \"Those can link up,\" he said.\n\nThe first case had one genetic difference from the original virus that was detected in Wuhan. The new case had that mutation, plus three additional ones. More than 125 genomes derived from samples taken from coronavirus patients around the world have been shared among scientists thus far, providing data for the analysis.\n\nIn the first case in Washington, the man in his 30s had been traveling in Wuhan, China, and returned home to Snohomish County, Wash., on Jan. 15. He sought medical care a few days later after developing symptoms and suspecting that he might have the coronavirus, officials have said, and tests later came back positive.\n\nHealth officials then scrambled to retrace his history, tracking down eight people he had socialized with at a group lunch and 37 more who were in the clinic when he showed up for medical help. They also reached out to people on his flight back to the United States.\n\nBut as the man remained in hospital isolation, and then later returned home, officials reported no new cases in Washington state. They tested two dozen people over a span of five weeks, and all came back negative.\n\nThat changed this week, when the state laboratory became able to test for the virus. Officials reported two new confirmed cases Friday night, and then more, including the first patient to die of the virus in the United States. They are now working to trace how the cases in the state might be linked, and who else might have been exposed.\n\nTwo cases have been detected at a skilled nursing facility in Kirkland, Wash., where officials said dozens of other people also had symptoms that could be a sign of coronavirus infection but could also be symptoms of flu.\n\nGov. Jay Inslee of Washington has declared a state of emergency, and said officials may need to take steps like canceling sporting events and closing schools to slow the spread of the virus in the community.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sheri_fink@nytimes.com", "name": "Sheri Fink", "type": "author", "isAgency":

See a doctor. Use a separate bathroom from the people you live with. Prepare for schools to close, and to work from home. These are measures the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended to slow a coronavirus outbreak in the United States.\n\nYet these are much easier to do for certain people -- in particular, high-earning professionals. Service industry workers, like those in restaurants, retail, child care and the gig economy, are much less likely to have paid sick days, the ability to work remotely or employer-provided health insurance.\n\nThe disparity could make the new coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness known as Covid-19, harder to contain in the United States than in other rich countries that have universal benefits like health care and sick leave, experts say. A large segment of workers could not stay home, and many of them work in jobs that include high contact with other people. It could also mean that low-income workers are hit harder by the virus.\n\n\"Very quickly, it's going to circulate a lot faster in the poorer communities than the wealthiest ones,\" said Dr. James Hadler, an epidemiologist who was Connecticut's public health director and is now is a consultant to the state. His work has found that influenza infections tend to strike low-income neighborhoods more aggressively than affluent ones, and that poor families are more likely to live in close quarters with others, and to share bathrooms.\n\nUnequal access to precautionary measures cuts along the same lines that divide the United States in other ways: income, education and race.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface.

Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak.\n\n\"It's definitely an equity issue,\" said Alex Baptiste, policy counsel for workplace programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group. \"You have not just an economic disparity but also a racial disparity between who has that access and can take care of themselves and their families.\"\n\nPortia Green, 33, is a restaurant worker in New York. She has no paid sick leave or health insurance. If schools closed, as a single mother she'd have no child care. A day off work means losing around $100 in pay, she said, and if she had to take more than a few days off, losing her job. The restaurants where she's worked are too understaffed to call in backup workers easily, she said, and the expectation is that you show up unless you're \"green.\"\n\n\"They're going to push you to do it anyway,\" said Ms. Green, who is a member of Restaurant Opportunities Centers United in New York, an advocacy group. \"You go to work, pop a vitamin C and if you can do it, you do it.\"\n\nThe biggest disparity for workers is access to health care: In the United States, some 27.5 million people lack any form of health insurance. That makes them less likely to seek medical care when they get sick or to have access to preventive health benefits that can help them stave off illness. The uninsured are disproportionately low income.\n\nWorkers also have unequal access to remote working. The government recommended that people work from home in a coronavirus outbreak, but just 29 percent of American workers can do so, according to Labor Department data. They are most likely to be highly educated and high earners.\n\nOn an average day, 35 percent of the highest earners and 8 percent of the lowest earners spend some time working from home. Managers and professionals are most likely to do so, and service industry and construction workers least likely. Nearly half of workers with a graduate degree do some of their work from home, as do a third of those with a college degree. Just 12 percent of those who didn't attend college work from home.\n\nFor many workers, being sick means choosing between staying home and getting paid. One-quarter of workers have no access to paid sick days, according to Labor Department data: two-thirds of the lowest earners but just 6 percent of the highest earners. Just a handful of states and local governments have passed sick leave laws.\n\nOnly 60 percent of workers in service occupations can take paid time off when they are ill -- and they are also more likely than white-collar workers to come in contact with other people's bodies or food.\n\n\"When you're talking about paid leave and who should stay home, it's the ones who need it most that don't have access to it, the ones showing up at work sick touching your food, touching your bags, coming into everyday contact with your direct life,\" said Kris Garcia, 43, an airport worker in Denver.\n\nShe will not receive paid sick days until she works at her job half a year, and even then, plans to save them for dealing with a chronic disease, hemophilia. \"I think people should stay home,\" said Ms. Garcia, who is helping an advocacy group called Family Values at Work on paid leave. \"But I know I'd need my infusions, whereas if I'm coughing and have a fever, I could push through five hours.\"\n\nEvidence shows that paid sick time reduces the spread of illness. A working paper on state laws that require employers to offer paid sick leave found that statewide influenza infections fell 11 percent in the first year after enactment compared with places that made no such change. An earlier paper, on city laws, showed a similar, but smaller, effect. (There are differences between influenza and the new coronavirus, but the two diseases are transmitted in similar ways.)\n\n\"It's very clear: When people don't have access to sick leave, they go to work sick and spread diseases,\" said Nicolas Ziebarth, an associate professor of economics at Cornell University, who was a co-author on both papers.\n\nStill, paid sick time works only if people take it. Even when workers have paid sick leave, American work culture often rewards going to work at all costs. In an average month, one in 10 workers said they needed to take leave but did not, and the most common reason was for their own illness, according to Labor Department data.\n\nThe top reasons for not taking it when they needed it: having too much work, fearing negative repercussions or being unable to afford a day off.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

and American should begin preparations now, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,\" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a new briefing.\n\nThe news caps weeks of fear that the coronavirus spreading from China may become a pandemic, disrupting the global economy and political landscape in ways that are difficult to forecast.\n\nIran, South Korea and Italy are now grappling with clusters of infection, even as the epidemic in China's Hubei Province seems to be slowing. In the United States, stocks tumbled on Monday as the dimensions of the outbreak became clearer.\n\nOfficials at the C.D.C. said they did not know whether spread of the disease to the United States would be mild or severe. But Americans should be ready for a significant disruption to their daily lives, she added.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 25, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nThe World Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world is not ready for a major outbreak. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all non-essential travel to South Korea and China. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\n\"We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad,\" Dr. Messonnier said.\n\nIn Washington, the secretary of health and human services told a Senate panel that federal and local health departments will need as many as 300 million masks for health care workers and additional ventilators for hospitals to prepare for an outbreak of coronavirus in the U.S.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented potentially severe health challenge globally,\" Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, told a Senate subcommittee.\n\nBut lawmakers from both parties made it clear they were unconvinced the Trump administration was prepared for the outbreak that the C.D.C. is forecasting.\n\nAs Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed for an exact number on people expected to be infected, the acting secretary of Homeland Security Department, Chad F. Wolf, could not answer.\n\n\"I'm all for committees and task forces but you're the secretary,\" Mr. Kennedy responded. \"I think you ought to know that answer.\"\n\nTrump administration officials overseeing the response to a potential coronavirus outbreak told lawmakers that the initial amount of money requested by the White House -- $1.25 billion in new funds and $1.25 billion taken from other programs -- would likely be just a first round.\n\n\"We're really learning day by day and week by week of the contours of this disease,\" Mr. Azar said.\n\nLawmakers listening to Mr. Azar's requests appeared startled.\n\nSenator Patty Murray asked the health secretary whether he thought the United States currently had enough health masks in stock.\n\n\"Of course not,\" he responded, \"or else we wouldn't be asking for more.\"\n\nMr. Azar said that officials currently had 30 million N95 masks in the nation's emergency stockpile, which typically cost less than $1.\n\nMr. Azar said he was alarmed by the human-to-human transmission of the virus in other parts of the world without an identifiable connection to confirmed cases, and what that could mean for how the virus may hit the United States in the coming months.\n\n\"We cannot hermetically seal off the United States to a virus,\" Mr. Azar said. \"And we need to be realistic about that.\"\n\nDr. Messonnier said that she had sat down with her children and told them, \"we as a family need to preparing for significant disruption of our lives.\"\n\nAmericans \"should ask their schools about plans for dismissal\" and for conducting classes online in the event that the spread of illness becomes serious, she said.\n\n\"I contacted my local school superintendent this morning with exactly those questions.\"\n\n[Like the

And in New York, London and Tokyo, financial markets plummeted Monday and Tuesday on fears that the virus will cripple the global economy.\n\nDr. Messonnier said that she had sat down with her children and told them, \"we as a family need to prepare for significant disruption of our lives.\"\n\nAmericans \"should ask their schools about plans for dismissal\" and for conducting classes online in the event that the spread of illness becomes serious, she said.\n\n\"I contacted my local school superintendent this morning with exactly those questions.\"\n\nRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pam_belluck@nytimes.com", "name": "Pam Belluck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Azar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Azar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Containment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Continent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Trump Makes Us Ill", "body": "Donald Trump was right.\n\nGerms are scary.\n\nFor three decades, I talked to Trump about his fear of germs. When I interviewed him at the Trump Tower restaurant during the 2016 race, the famous germophobe had a big hospital-strength bottle of hand sanitizer on the table, next to my salad, ready to squirt.\n\nHe told me about the nightmarish feeling he had when a man emerged from the bathroom in a restaurant with wet hands and shook his hand. He couldn't eat afterward.\n\nToday, in a stunning twist of fate, germs are infecting his presidency and threatening a bad prognosis for his re-election prospects.\n\nTrump is the first president to use the stock market as a near-daily measure of his success -- and his virility -- and now the market is slumping. If you want to own it on the way up, you have to own it on the way down.\n\nInvestors, who worried when Trump began to rise in politics, soon realized that he had their backs. He was just a corporate vessel pretending to be a populist; the stock market was his sugar high.\n\nNow Trump is learning the hard way what my fatalistic Irish mother taught me: The thing you love most is the first to go. As Mike Bloomberg points out, investors have factored in Trump's incompetence, and that is contributing to the market cratering.\n\nThe president urged the Fed to do something soon to mitigate the stock market losses. Socialism for the rich!\n\nThe scaremonger in chief has been downplaying the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic and joining Fox News hosts in accusing the \"anti-Trump\" media and \"Do Nothing Democrats\" of scaremongering about the virus.\n\nAt the CPAC convention, Mick Mulvaney told a cheering crowd that impeachment was the \"hoax of the day\" and now the press thinks the coronavirus \"is going to be what brings down the president.\" The media, he said, should spend more time on positive stories, like the president's \"caring\" relationship with his teenage son, Barron, even though White Houses usually frown on stories about young presidential offspring.\n\nMike Huckabee went on the attack, asserting that Trump \"could personally suck the virus out of every one of the 60,000 people in the world, suck it out of their lungs, swim to the bottom of the ocean and spit it out, and he would be accused of pollution for messing up the ocean.\"\n\nOn Fox, Don Jr. said the Democrats \"seemingly hope\" the virus kills millions to stop Trump's winning streak. Rush Limbaugh chimed in that the media \"would love for the coronavirus to be this deadly strain that wipes everybody out so they could blame Trump for it.\"\n\nThere are 2,800 dead worldwide and disturbing stories showing how federal criteria delayed the diagnosis of a California woman and how federal health employees interacted with Americans who had possibly been exposed to the virus in China without proper training or gear.\n\nYet Trump seems more consumed with how the Democrats might blame him for a coronavirus recession than with the virus itself.\n\nTrump had tweet-shrieked at President Barack Obama about how he should handle Ebola. (\"Obama should apologize to the American people & resign!\")\n\nYet he was so relaxed about the coronavirus threat that he spent 45 minutes Thursday chatting in the Oval with the authors of a little play called \"FBI Lovebirds: Undercovers,\" inspired by the texts of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The play's leads, Dean Cain of \"Superman\" fame and the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" actress Kristy Swanson, were also in the meeting. Trump joked that he'd be willing to be Cain's understudy, the actor said. The president got together the same day with a group that included his social media boosters Diamond and Silk.\n\nAt the White House press conference, Trump preened: \"Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low.\" He later said that one day, like a miracle, the virus \"will disappear.\"\n\nHis top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, pushed the crisis as an opportunity: \"Stocks look pretty cheap to me.\"\n\nTrump won't be able to deflect and project and create a daft alternative narrative. The virus won't respond to conspiracy theories from Rush Limbaugh or nasty diatribes from Sean Hannity or nicknames from Donald Trump.\n\nThis will be a deus ex machina test of Trump's authoritarian behavior. Epidemics are not well suited to authoritarian regimes and propaganda, as we saw this week when Beijing's use of propaganda tactics to suppress information about the outbreak failed spectacularly and when Iran tamped down news about the virus for political reasons even as it ravaged top officials.\n\nThe reality of the coronavirus spreading will reflect poorly on Trump -- his cavalier dismantling of vital government teams for health response and his disdain for experts and science.\n\nTrump tried to make federal agencies complicit on his fabulist hogwash about the size of his inaugural crowd and the path of Hurricane Dorian. It is unlikely that he will be able to keep his insatiable and insecure ego in check long enough to give the nation the facts, reassurance and guidance it needs about the infection.\n\nTrump is already doing his orange clown pufferfish routine, acting as though he knows more about viruses than anyone, just as he has bragged that he knows more about the military, taxes, trade, infrastructure, ISIS, renewables, visas, banking, debt and \"the horror of nuclear.\"\n\nHe appointed Mike Pence to be point man, even though, as the famously homophobic governor of Indiana, Pence helped make the H.I.V. epidemic there worse by substituting moral pronouncements for scientific knowledge. Coronavirus Czar Pence spent Friday at a $25,000-a-plate dinner in sunny Sarasota raising money to try to win back the House, The Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\nTrump's history in business -- he makes people feel good for a while and then it ends badly -- could presage a stock market crash before he exits.\n\nAnd it's conceivable that a crash -- along with hospitals being overwhelmed by the uninsured -- could lead to the election of a real populist promising Medicare for All.\n\nAnd that would be a very Trumpian arc indeed.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

what you need to know:Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, records the first infection in sub-Saharan Africa.Outbreak has \"pandemic potential,\" the W.H.O. warns.Asia markets open lower after a dismal day for the S&P 500.U.S. workers were sent into quarantine area unprotected and unprepared, complaint says.The thrill of the match, but no roar from the crowd.Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, records the first infection in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nNigeria on Friday confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the country, raising fears of how the disease could wreak havoc in Africa's most populous nation and across the continent.\n\nThe case was confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Health and was the first confirmed infection in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe health ministry said the patient was an Italian citizen who returned on Feb. 25 to Lagos, the country's largest city, after visiting Milan. The Nigerian government said in a statement that the unnamed patient was \"clinically stable,\" and did not have \"serious symptoms\" and was being treated at the Infectious Disease Hospital in Yaba, Lagos.\n\nDespite the steady number of flights and the growing relationship between China and African countries, the only previously confirmed infections on the continent had been in Egypt and Algeria.\n\n\"I wish to assure all Nigerians that have we have been beefing up our preparedness capabilities since the first confirmation of cases in China, and we will use all the resources made available by the government to respond to this case,\" Dr. Osagie Ehanire, Nigeria's minister of health, said in a statement.\n\nOutbreak has \"pandemic potential,\" the W.H.O. warns.\n\nThe steady global march of the new coronavirus outbreak transformed into a fierce gallop over the past 48 hours, as a dozen countries recorded their first confirmed cases and the world's leading health official warned of a coming pandemic.\n\n\"This virus has pandemic potential,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization on Thursday. \"We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for elderly family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak.\n\nThe warning came hours before the first case was confirmed on Friday in Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa.\n\nMore than 83,000 people in at least 47 countries have been infected. More new cases have been recently reported outside China, where the outbreak began in December, than within in the country. China enforced a lock down of 700 million people to control the spread of the virus.\n\nJapan closed its schools for at least a month. Iran canceled Friday Prayers in major cities. Saudi Arabia barred pilgrims from its holiest sites.\n\n\"This is not a time for fear,\" Dr. Tedros said. But markets panicked anyway.\n\nGlobal markets looked set to tumble for a seventh consecutive day on Friday, after the S&P 500 fell 4.4 percent on Thursday, the worst single-day slide for the benchmark since August 2011.\n\nAs new cases emerged in countries as diverse as Nigeria and Norway, the bulk of the infections outside China centered on three hot spots -- South Korea, Iran and Italy.\n\nDr. Tedros called the moment a \"decisive point\" in combatting the epidemic. \"This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now.\"\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 83,300 people in China and at least 47 other countries.\n\nAsia markets open lower after a dismal day for the S&P 500.\n\nGlobal markets looked set to tumble for a seventh consecutive day on Friday. Markets in Tokyo were down about 3 percent early in the day, while shares in Shanghai and Hong Kong opened about 2 percent lower.\n\nFutures markets suggested worries might ease later Friday, but sentiment has tended to worsen later in the trading day, particularly as the virus's spread has accelerated in Europe.\n\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 4.4 percent, the worst single-day slide for the market since August 2011. The benchmark index fell more than 10 percent in just over a week, reflecting rising fears over the coronavirus spreading quickly around the world.\n\nStocks in Europe and Asia were also hard hit on Thursday.\n\nThe sell-off came after infection figures in Europe and the Middle East continued to soar and after public health officials in the United States and Germany said new patients in each country had no known connection to others with the illness. That complicates efforts to track the virus, isolate infected people and keep the virus from spreading further.\n\nThe speed of the slump has been stunning, with the S&P 500 falling more than 10 percent from its Feb. 19 high, a drop that Wall Street labels a market correction to suggest the decline is more significant than a few days of downbeat trading.\n\nThe last time stocks in the United States fell more than 10 percent was late 2018, when investors worried that the trade war and rising interest rates might tip the U.S. economy into a recession. The Dow Jones industrial average also fell into a correction on Thursday, as did shares in London.\n\nU.S. workers were sent into quarantine area unprotected and unprepared, complaint says.\n\nFederal government health workers were not given proper medical training or protective gear when they were sent to assist Americans who had been quarantined for possible exposure to the coronavirus, according to a whistle-blower complaint.\n\nStaff members entered quarantine areas at Travis Air Force Base and March Air Reserve Base in California, interacted with the people who were in isolation and then moved freely around and off the bases, the complaint said.\n\nThe whistle-blower, described as a senior leader at the Department of Health and Human Services, said at least one worker stayed in a nearby hotel and left California on a commercial flight.\n\nMany of the health workers were unaware of the need to test their temperatures three times a day, the person said. The complaint was submitted to the Office of the Special Counsel, and a portion was obtained by The New York Times.\n\nThe employees were not given training in safety protocols until five days after they were ordered into quarantined areas, including a hangar where evacuees from coronavirus hot zones in China and elsewhere were being received, the whistle-blower said.\n\nThe first U.S. case of coronavirus infection in a patient with no known risk factors -- travel to a hot zone or contact with another person known to be infected -- emerged this week near Travis Air Force Base.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged the complaint, saying, \"We take all whistle-blower complaints very seriously.\"\n\nThe thrill of the match, but no roar from the crowd.\n\nThe stands didn't fill and the crowd didn't roar, but there was an important soccer match scheduled in Milan, Italy, on Thursday so Internazionale, the home team, and Ludogorets, the visitors from Bulgaria, set aside their fears about the coronavirus and dutifully went about playing each other.\n\nItalian health officials had set the bizarre stage for the game by ordering the stadium closed to spectators. In Italy, where the number of confirmed coronavirus cases soared past 600 this week, the authorities have restricted public gatherings in an attempt the slow the spread of the outbreak.\n\nBut the Europa League schedule was inflexible, and so the round-of-32 game went on, with only the players' shouts, the coaches' instructions and the referee's whistle as a soundtrack.\n\nNew York may have its first case, city officials say.\n\nNew York City officials said on Thursday they had a possible coronavirus patient and were sending a sample for testing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The patient had respiratory symptoms and had recently traveled in Italy, which has emerged as a hub of the coronavirus, health officials said.\n\nHealth officials said the patient was under 50, but provided few other biographical details. This was the first suspected case in New York City since the C.D.C. expanded its testing criteria to account for the spread of the virus in a number of countries beyond China, including Iran, Italy, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nNew York City has had no confirmed cases of the virus so far. Seven patients had previously been deemed potential cases, only to be ruled out after testing.\n\nReporting was contributed by Russell Goldman, Abdi Latif Dahir, Andrew Das, Jamal Jordan, Heather

87,000 Worldwide\n\nAustralia and the United States reported their first deaths from the coronavirus, as Iran and South Korea saw big upswings in new cases.\n\nRight Now\n\nChina's leader, Xi Jinping, says the country must strengthen its defenses against outbreaks.\n\nHere's what you need to know:As the U.S. marks its first death, Trump announces new travel restrictions.The global total: Nearly 87,000 cases.Xi Jinping says China must do better.Australia's first death from the virus is a Diamond Princess passenger.First U.S. coronavirus death is recorded near Seattle.\n\nAs the U.S. marks its first death, Trump announces new travel restrictions.\n\nPresident Trump sought on Saturday to more aggressively address the coronavirus after weeks of confusion over his administration's response, urging public calm and issuing new foreign travel warnings and restrictions.\n\nAt a White House news conference, Mr. Trump acknowledged the first death recorded in the United States, in Washington State. Vice President Mike Pence said the administration was issuing its highest-level warning, known as a \"do not travel\" warning, to areas of Italy and South Korea most affected by the virus.\n\nThe United States is also barring all travel to Iran, and barring entry to any foreign citizen who has visited Iran in the last 14 days. There will also be screenings of travelers coming from Italy and South Korea.\n\nSpeaking later Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Trump also suggested the United States was ready to help Iranians amid an outbreak there.\n\n\"If we can help the Iranians, we have the greatest health care professionals in the world,\" he said, adding that \"we would love to be able to help them.\"\n\n\"All they have to do is ask,\" he said.\n\nAiming to calm the public after the worst week for the stock market since 2008, the president, flanked by top federal public health officials, appealed to \"the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite a panic, because there's no reason to panic at all.\"\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 86,900 people in at least COUNTRIES_WITH_CASES countries.\n\nThe global total: Nearly 87,000 cases.\n\nOf the nearly 87,000 coronavirus cases recorded globally as of Sunday, fewer than 7,200 were outside of mainland China.\n\nThe Chinese authorities reported 573 new cases. That brings the country's total to 79,824 since the outbreak began, a figure that includes people who have recovered or died. China also reported 35 new deaths on Sunday, a drop from the previous day's toll of 47.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for elderly family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak.\n\nThe virus has now been detected in at least 59 countries. Qatar confirmed its first case on Saturday, a 36-year-old Qatari citizen who had been in quarantine since recently returning from Iran, the country's health ministry said.\n\nIran, which has been at the center of the virus's spread in the region, confirmed an additional 205 cases on Saturday, bringing its official total to 593. The death toll rose by nine, to 43 -- a number many public health experts say indicates a wider spread than officials have acknowledged.\n\nSouth Korea, which has the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China, reported 376 new cases on Sunday, bringing its total to 3,526.\n\nItaly, the center of the outbreak in Europe, now has a total of 1,128 confirmed cases and 29 deaths. France has reported 100 cases and two deaths. Australia, which has 25 confirmed cases, reported its first death from the virus on Sunday.\n\nXi Jinping says China must do better.\n\nChina's initial response to the coronavirus epidemic was marred by policy stumbles that fueled public anger, the nation's leader, Xi Jinping, said in published speech excerpts that laid out his ideas for strengthening the country's defenses against such outbreaks.\n\nMr. Xi's comments, drawn from two internal speeches that he made in February, were published on Saturday in Qiushi, or \"Seeking Truth,\" the ruling Communist Party's leading journal. They seemed intended to highlight the policy and legal changes that Mr. Xi intends to push to confront the epidemic.\n\nThose include banning the trade in wildlife that scientists believe may have let the coronavirus jump from animals into the human population; more effective monitoring of potential epidemics; and stronger coordination to direct emergency medical supplies when an outbreak happens.\n\nWhile praising the Chinese government's response to the crisis, Mr. Xi also acknowledged problems, using blunter language than he has in previous public comments on the epidemic.\n\n\"Some localities and departments were at a loss in how to react to this sudden epidemic,\" Mr. Xi said. \"Some protective measures went through abrupt changes, and in some areas there was even lawless and criminal conduct that seriously impeded containing the epidemic, and there was public dissatisfaction about this.\"\n\nMr. Xi did not elaborate on what he meant by criminal conduct. Chinese news media have reported cases of officials neglecting stricken families, as well as crude, unhygienic efforts to transfer patients.\n\nAfter more than a month of emergency measures that have locked down cities, towns and villages, and shut down much transportation, commerce and industry, China appears to be taming the new coronavirus, labeled Covid-19, that emerged late last year in Wuhan, a city in the country's center. On Saturday, China officially recorded 573 new infections, and another 35 deaths, from the virus.\n\nIn his latest comments, Mr. Xi tried to look beyond the immediate crisis, laying out areas where he wants changed policy. These included:\n\nImproved health services. China has been building a safety net of medical insurance for citizens, but the expense and inadequacies of basic health care remain a source of public ire -- and a problem highlighted by the epidemic. Mr. Xi signaled that the government would try to channel more spending to ease those problems. \"Don't let small ailments brew into major epidemics,\" he said.\n\nThat would entail more spending on medical training, especially for general practitioners, he suggested. Chinese hospitals often refer patients to specialists, even for common illnesses that general practitioners could easily treat.\n\nCracking down on the illegal trade in wildlife. Scientists generally believe that the coronavirus may have spread from a wholesale market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, where some vendors sold wildlife. They say the pathogen may have jumped from bats to other animals, possibly pangolins, and to humans.\n\n\"Resolutely ban and harshly attack the illegal market and trade in wildlife,\" he said in the comments published Saturday. \"Contain major public health hazards at their source.\"\n\nImproved emergency preparations. The Chinese government has touted its vast mobilization of officials, doctors and medical resources to fight the epidemic. In his latest comments, Mr. Xi said that even so, China could do better. He called for clear lines of command in response to public health emergencies.\n\nAs Mr. Xi often does, he emphasized the potential of new, data-driven technology to improve the government's response. \"We must encourage the application of big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and other digital technology to play a better supporting role in monitoring and analyzing outbreaks, tracing viruses, prevention and treatment, and allocating resources,\" he said.\n\nNo signs of liberalization. One notable thing was what Mr. Xi did not say. Many Chinese people, including health experts, have said that the epidemic illustrated the risks to public health created by official censorship, which early in the epidemic led to doctors being silenced by the authorities after they discussed the outbreak with colleagues. One of those doctors, Li Wenliang, himself died from the virus, making him into a martyr-like symbol of the costs of speaking out.\n\nBut Mr. Xi gave no indication that loosening censorship was on his agenda. The government, he said, would continue to crack down on \"concocting and spreading rumors\" -- the accusation that the police in Wuhan leveled against Dr. Li.\n\nAustralia's first death from the virus is a Diamond Princess passenger.\n\nA 78-year-old man died of the coronavirus early Sunday at a hospital in Perth, Australia, the first known death from the illness in that country, officials said. He had been a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where a large concentration of coronavirus infections emerged last month as it was docked in Japan.\n\nThe man's death was announced by Andrew Robertson, chief health officer at the Western Australia Department of Health. The man's wife, who had also been on the cruise ship and was later diagnosed with the virus, was in stable condition, Mr. Robertson said.\n\nAustralia has so far reported 25 confirmed cases of the new virus, nine of which were associated with the Diamond Princess. Fifteen of these patients have recovered.\n\n\"We still need to make the point very clear that there isn't community spread within Australia,\" Mr. Robertson said. \"This very tragic case is still related to the Diamond Princess.\"\n\n\"The public shouldn't be panicking at this stage,\" he said.\n\nFirst U.S. coronavirus death is recorded near Seattle.\n\nA person near Seattle has become the first coronavirus patient to die in the United States, health officials said on Saturday. The person was a patient at a hospital in Kirkland, Wash.\n\nIn referring to the death at a news conference, President Trump said the victim was a \"wonderful woman\" in her 50s, but local officials later said the patient had been a man in his 50s. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later clarified that the patient was, in fact, a man, and that the agency's director had also misstated the patient's sex at the president's news conference.\n\nWashington State health officials also announced two cases of people tied to a nursing facility near Seattle and said more than 50 people in the facility had begun to show symptoms, a possible sign of an outbreak among a particularly vulnerable population.\n\nA health care worker and a resident at the facility, Life Care Center of Kirkland, had both tested positive for the virus. There are 288 staff and residents at the facility.\n\nGovernor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, directing state agencies to do everything reasonably possible to assist affected communities. The proclamation allows the use of the Washington National Guard, if necessary.\n\nDr. Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., said there was no evidence that the person had traveled recently or had contact with someone known to have the virus.\n\nExperts warn that cases of unknown origin are a worrying sign that the virus is spreading in this country. Similar cases also reported on Friday involved a high school student from north of Seattle; an employee of a school near Portland, Ore.; a woman in Santa Clara County, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley; and a man in southeastern England.\n\nReporting was contributed by Mike Baker, Michael Crowley, Keith Bradsher and Raymond Zhong.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Mike Pence. Feeling more secure?\n\n\"I know full well the importance of presidential leadership,\" the vice president said as soon as he was introduced in his new role.\n\nTotally qualified. First criteria for every job in this administration is capacity for praising the gloriousness of our commander in chief.\n\nYeah, when you think of Mike Pence you maybe don't think about Pandemic Fighter Supreme. But as President Trump pointed out repeatedly, he has already run Indiana.\n\nWell, it probably could have been worse. Having a czar does make you feel there's somebody in charge. At least Trump didn't come before the cameras and announce solemnly, \"Today I'm asking every American to cross your fingers.\"\n\nOur president had to be going crazy over a problem that involves both declining stock prices and germs. This is the guy, after all, who thinks shaking hands is \"barbaric,\" who is followed around by aides bearing sanitizer. During his press conference he told the story of a fever-ridden supporter who gave him a hug. Do you think it was an apocryphal fantasy? Either way, the idea has been haunting him forever.\n\nMeanwhile, he's come up with a totally new explanation for the stock market skid. It turns out investors were not frightened so much by the pandemic as the Democratic debate.\n\n\"I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nPlus that virus thing is ... not necessarily a big deal. What really \"shocked\" him, Trump said, was his discovery that \"the flu in our country kills 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year.\"\n\nSo the problems are the Democrats and the flu. The answers are Mike Pence and ... reminding the public once again that Nancy Pelosi's district has a big homeless problem.\n\nEarlier in the day Trump argued, via tweet, that despite the expressions of concern by the evil media and \"incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades,\" the government is perfectly prepared to handle the coronavirus. Which he misspelled \"caronavirus.\" But nobody's perfect.\n\nThe president had been saying everything is totally under control for some time. (\"It's one person coming in from China.\") The whole administration picked up the cry. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, 82, overcame his habit of dozing off at meetings long enough to tell Fox Business Network that the disease would \"accelerate the return of jobs\" from overseas.\n\nTrump totally agrees. \"What it's gonna do is keep people home, and they're going to travel to places we have,\" he said.\n\nSee? The virus thing is a bonus.\n\nThe run-up to the Pence unveiling had not been exactly calming for citizens who wanted to have faith in competent White House oversight. Barack Obama used to have special epidemic-watching groups just in case this kind of crisis developed. One was headed by the highly regarded Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, who got sent packing by John Bolton. Another infectious disease expert, Tom Bossert, suddenly vanished from the Department of Homeland Security in 2018, presumably also at the hand of John You-know-who.\n\nIf Bolton's memoir ever makes it into print, do you think it'll have a chapter called \"My War on Pandemic Fighters?\" OK, probably not.\n\nVirus Week hasn't really provided a whole lot of comfort to citizens who wanted to believe the president's replacements were super high quality.\n\nThe nation got its first real look at Chad Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, who appeared before a Senate subcommittee and admitted he had no idea how the virus was transmitted among humans, exactly how dangerous it was, or ... pretty much anything.\n\nWhen Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican not known for anti-administration bias, asked whether the country had enough respirators to deal with a coronavirus epidemic, Wolf answered in the affirmative.\n\n\"We just heard testimony that we don't,\" Kennedy responded.\n\n\"OK,\" said Wolf.\n\nTo be fair, he's only been on the job since November. He's the fifth head of Homeland Security Trump's had in the last three years. Good thing he has a deputy -- or at least an acting deputy -- to help. That would be Ken Cuccinelli, who made news this week when he went on Twitter to ask for tips on how to find an online map of coronavirus sites posted by Johns Hopkins University. (\"Here's hoping it goes back up soon.\")\n\nLosing faith in presidential appointees for health protection? Stop being so negative. They're all vetted by the Presidential Personnel Office, which is now headed by John McEntee, 29, who was previously fired from another White House job because of concerns about a history of gambling problems and tax issues.\n\nMcEntee will be getting plenty of help from other stellar appointees, the newest being a 23-year-old college undergraduate. Together they're going to be cleaning house, getting rid of folks who are insufficiently loyal to the president. Or maybe aren't qualified or something. Never can tell.\n\nAlso part of the new coronavirus response team is Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services -- a veteran cabinet member and experienced former pharmaceutical lobbyist.\n\nAt a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Azar was asked if he'd consider using some of the billions of dollars in funds for Trump's border wall to help combat the current health crisis.\n\nAzar just chuckled. Actually, people, this is probably not a theme we ought to be pursuing. Chances are, if the president is encouraged to mix the subjects of coronavirus and Mexico walls, he'll suddenly announce that we need a barrier much bigger and thicker and more expensive, so it can stop the flow of immigrant germs.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

From an evangelical church in South Korea to a holy Shiite city in Iran. Governments and health workers around the world scrambled to contain the rapidly spreading new coronavirus, as the number of new cases outside China for the first time exceeded those inside the country at the heart of the epidemic.\n\nMore than 81,000 people have been infected with the virus that causes the respiratory disease Covid-19, and new cases have been documented in at least 44 countries and on every continent but Antarctica. So far, nearly 3,000 people have died, the vast majority of them in a single Chinese province, Hubei.\n\nIn Europe, France, Spain and Germany reported increases in cases, likely tied to an outbreak in Italy's Lombardy region, where more than 400 people have been infected.\n\nIn the Middle East, a dangerous cluster in Iran, where at least 100 people had been infected, spread to Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia halted visits to the holiest sites in Islam, in the cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nIn Asia, as the authorities in China were slowly lifting citywide lockdowns that had ensnared more than 100 million people, a major outbreak tied to a megachurch in South Korea ballooned to more than 1,500 cases.\n\nSouth America recorded its first case, a 61-year-old man in Brazil. And a person in California who had not been exposed to anyone known to be infected tested positive for the virus.\n\nAs fears spread to the United States, President Trump named Vice President Mike Pence his point person to coordinate the government's response, expressing confidence that the United States would prevent a widespread domestic outbreak.\n\n\"We're very, very ready for this,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 82,100 people in China and 44 other countries.\n\nSouth Korea and U.S. call off joint military exercises.\n\nThe fast-growing coronavirus outbreak touched South Korea's military alliance with the United States on Thursday, as the two countries announced that they would postpone their joint spring military exercise.\n\nThe decision came as South Korea reported 334 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the total number to 1,595, the largest outbreak outside of China. Nearly 84 percent of the patients were from Daegu, a city in southeastern South Korea, and in nearby towns.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States military reported the first case of a soldier being infected. The soldier was stationed at a base near Daegu.\n\nBoth South Korea and the United States said their annual spring combined training, originally scheduled to take place next month, would be postponed \"until further notice.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all non-essential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for eldery family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nThe World Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world is not ready for a major outbreak.\n\nSouth Korea has placed itself on the highest possible alert to deal with the outbreak, suspending nonessential military training and placing more than 9,500 troops under quarantine. It has also barred most of its enlisted soldiers from taking leave.\n\nClinical trials are expanded for possible antiviral treatment.\n\nThe drug maker Gilead Sciences is expanding its clinical trials of the antiviral drug remdesivir as a possible coronavirus treatment into several countries, mainly in Asia.\n\nTwo new clinical trials starting in March will involve about 1,000 patients who are severely or moderately ill from the virus, to try to determine which patients would be helped most, Gilead said.\n\nThe drug is experimental and has not been approved yet to treat any disease. It is already being tested in Wuhan, China, the center of the epidemic, and on patients who are being treated in Nebraska.\n\n\"We are looking for ways we can help the world prepare as well as possible for what appears to be a pandemic at this point,\" Dr. Diana Brainard, Gilead's senior vice president for H.I.V. and emerging viruses, said in an interview.\n\nIn the last month, Gilead's stock has risen 17 percent, to $74.70 at the close of markets Wednesday from $68.80 in late January.\n\nThe Times begins a newsletter on the crisis.\n\nThe Times is beginning a coronavirus newsletter, an informed guide to the outbreak with the latest developments from our reporting and expert advice about prevention and treatment.\n\nEvery day at 6 p.m. Eastern (7 a.m. in Hong Kong), we'll tell you exactly what you need to know about this far-reaching and fast-moving story.\n\nSign up here.\n\nU.S. reports its first potential case of community transmission.\n\nA person in California who was not exposed to anyone known to be infected with the coronavirus, and who had not traveled to countries where it is circulating, has tested positive for the infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday night. It may be the first instance of community transmission in the United States.\n\n\"The case was detected through the U.S. public health system and picked up by astute clinicians,\" a C.D.C. statement said.\n\nIt brought the number of cases in the United States to 60, including the 45 cases among Americans repatriated from Wuhan, China -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- and the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was overwhelmed by the virus after it docked in Japan.\n\nThe new case, in which the source of infection is unknown, is cause for concern, experts said.\n\n\"That would suggest there are other undetected cases out there, and we have already started some low-grade transmission,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.\n\nWorkers, go home: Companies try to ward off virus's spread.\n\nAn oil company and a media group have told hundreds of employees in London to work from home. A German airline has asked workers to take unpaid leave.\n\nFor weeks, the coronavirus outbreak in China rattled global supply chains, exacting a toll on major businesses around the world, though often in indirect ways. Now, as it spreads across Europe and Asia, the virus is becoming a more immediate threat to all types of businesses.\n\nFrom Milan to Berlin to London, companies in practically every industry are refining their emergency protocols or sending employees home to prevent an outbreak.\n\nThis week, Chevron instructed 300 workers at one of its London offices to work from home after an employee returning from Italy developed flulike symptoms. The media group OMG has taken the same step in London, sending home 1,000 employees after a staff member began showing symptoms. And Germany's flagship airline, Lufthansa, has frozen hiring and offered employees unpaid leave.\n\nFor the most part, these disruptions to daily work life have been confined to Europe and Asia. In China, most businesses ground to a halt in January as the government worked to contain the outbreak, which has sickened tens of thousands of people and killed over 3,000.\n\nSyracuse shuts its Italy program, joining other colleges in suspending studies abroad.\n\nSyracuse University moved on Wednesday to shut down a study abroad program in Florence, Italy, as the coronavirus continues to spread, bringing to at least six the number of universities and colleges that have taken such steps.\n\n\"Yesterday, on very short notice, we made the difficult decision to suspend our academic program in Florence, Italy, based on Italy's very aggressive stance toward virus containment and travel restrictions,\" Kent Syverud, the Syracuse chancellor, said in a statement.\n\nNew York University's president, Andrew Hamilton, said in a statement on Wednesday that \"out of an abundance of caution,\" classes in Florence were being canceled for the rest of the week, and students there were to \"promptly travel home or to another appropriate location.\"\n\nOther colleges that have suspended study abroad programs include Elon University, Fairfield University, Florida International University and the University of Tennessee.\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics will go forward, planners say.\n\nWith just under five months before the opening of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo on July 24, organizers in Japan and at the International Olympic Committee say they are confident the Games will go on.\n\nAt a news briefing on Wednesday, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said that preparations for the Games were proceeding \"as planned,\" adding that the Olympic torch would begin its journey to Japan in March as scheduled.\n\nThe I.O.C. has also declined to entertain the possibility that the Games might not take place as planned.\n\nBut sporting events in Japan and elsewhere are already being canceled, as governments try to discourage large gatherings in major cities. In preparing for the Olympics, Japan had focused on the prevention of measles and rubella, sexually transmitted diseases and food poisoning.\n\nA new disease, like the coronavirus, was not central to its calculations.\n\n\"I've never seen an Olympic organizing committee asked, 'Are you prepared for a global pandemic?'\" said Terrence Burns, a veteran Olympics consultant.\n\nReporting and research

pundits accused Democrats and journalists of \"politicizing and actually weaponizing\" an infectious disease.\n\nThe stock market is swooning. Consumers are stockpiling masks and antibacterial gels. President Trump's response to a global epidemic has done little to quell fears.\n\nIn the right-wing media universe, however, the commotion over the coronavirus is hardly a crisis for the White House. Instead, it's just another biased attack on a president from the usual haters.\n\n\"It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump,\" Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host, said on his syndicated program this week, dismissing the disease as a Democratic talking point.\n\n\"The coronavirus is the common cold, folks,\" Mr. Limbaugh added, incorrectly. (The coronavirus is more deadly and more contagious than the common cold, and it can cause severe flulike symptoms.)\n\nViewers of the Fox News talk show \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday heard the co-host Ainsley Earhardt introduce a segment by announcing: \"Let's talk about the Democrats and the media with this coronavirus, and they're making it political.\"\n\nHer guest was Pete Hegseth, a \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" co-host and an on-air Trump cheerleader who doubles as an informal confidant of the president.\n\n\"I don't want to say this, I don't relish the reality,\" Mr. Hegseth began. \"But you start to feel, you really do -- watch the Democrats, watch the media -- that they're rooting for coronavirus to spread. They're rooting for it to grow. They're rooting for the problem to get worse.\"\n\nMs. Earhardt and her co-hosts, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade, nodded along. Their show is the highest-rated morning program on cable news.\n\nAs public health experts warn that the spread of the coronavirus is inevitable and urge Americans to take precautions, the pro-Trump media world has presented the subject as more fodder for partisan debate.\n\nThe losses in the stock market -- one of the president's self-appointed barometers of the nation's success -- are described as a consequence of fears deliberately spread by liberals and biased journalists, rather than a reaction by investors concerned about how the virus has affected economies around the world.\n\nThe coronavirus, from this standpoint, is compared to impeachment and the special counsel's report, major news events dismissed by Trump allies as hyped-up nonevents.\n\nThat view was validated on Friday by one of the federal government's highest-ranking officials: Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff. He told conservative activists that the media focus on the coronavirus was an effort to hurt Mr. Trump.\n\n\"The reason you're seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,\" Mr. Mulvaney said in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. \"That's what this is all about.\"\n\nThere is little doubt that a global health crisis suits the relentless churn of 24-hour cable news networks, no matter the ideology of their commentators. Every major news channel has devoted hundreds of hours to examining the contagion.\n\nInevitably, the demand for disease news can elevate pundits with relatively little expertise. Helen Branswell, who writes about global health for STAT, a health news website based in Boston, said she had heard from many unqualified people hoping to be quoted on the coronavirus.\n\n\"My inbox is flooded with people trying to get me to interview people who are being passed out as experts, who really are not experts,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, the coverage, presented with the signature flash of cable news, has at times amplified misleading or downright false narratives about the spread of the virus.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, for instance, floated the possibility in a Fox News interview that the coronavirus had originated at a Chinese laboratory, a theory that scientists say lacks any evidence.\n\nJon Cohen, who is among the team of reporters covering the coronavirus for the magazine Science, said anyone exaggerating the likelihood that the virus had been created in a laboratory could leave viewers misinformed.\n\n\"It reinforces biases people have against China, against government, against scientific research,\" Mr. Cohen said.\n\nMr. Limbaugh, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Mr. Trump this month, used his radio program this week to link the virus with the Democratic presidential front-runner, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\n\"Just keep in mind where the coronavirus came from,\" Mr. Limbaugh told listeners. \"It came from a country that Bernie Sanders wants to turn the United States into a mirror image of: Communist China.\" (At a CNN town hall on Monday, Mr. Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist, described China as an \"authoritarian country, becoming more and more authoritarian,\" adding that it had \"taken more people out of extreme poverty\" than any other nation.)\n\nMr. Limbaugh also advanced a baseless claim that the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, was biased against the president because her brother is Rod Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general who was a target of Mr. Trump's attacks.\n\nAllies of the Trump administration often take a warlike stance toward any issue that poses a threat to the president's reputation, adopting the language of victimhood and grievance.\n\nSean Hannity, at the top of his Fox News program on Thursday, attributed the worries over the coronavirus to a fear campaign led by \"the media mob and the Democratic extreme radical socialist party.\"\n\n\"They're now sadly politicizing and actually weaponizing an infectious disease, in what is basically just the latest effort to bludgeon President Trump,\" Mr. Hannity declared. \"Many on the left are now all rooting for corona to wreak havoc in the United States. Why? To score cheap, repulsive political points.\" (Mr. Hannity averages more than three million viewers a night, the biggest audience on cable news.)\n\nOne Hannity guest had the temerity to dissent -- sort of. Geraldo Rivera, a Fox News regular, agreed with Mr. Hannity's contention that Democrats had sought to arouse fear. But he told Mr. Hannity that \"our friend, President Trump,\" had not handled the situation ideally.\n\nThe president \"was too cool for school,\" Mr. Rivera said. \"I think it would have been better if he were more energetic, more pointed and forceful -- \"\n\nBefore he could finish his thought, he was interrupted by Mr. Hannity and another guest, the Trump loyalist Dan Bongino, who quickly rebuked his colleague.\n\n\"That's a horrible analysis, Geraldo,\" Mr. Bongino said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_m_grynbaum@nytimes.com", "name": "Michael M.

President Trump and members of his administration mobilized on Friday to confront the threat of the coronavirus -- not just the outbreak but the news media and the Democrats they accused of exaggerating its danger in order to destroy his presidency.\n\nWhile stock markets tumbled, companies searched for new supply chains and health officials scrambled to prevent a spread of the virus, Mr. Trump and his aides, congressional allies and backers in the conservative media sought to blame the messenger and the political opposition in the latest polarizing moment in the nation's capital.\n\nMr. Trump said that news outlets like CNN were \"doing everything they can to instill fear in people,\" while some Democrats were \"trying to gain political favor by saying a lot of untruths.\" His acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, went even further, telling conservative activists that journalists were hyping the coronavirus because \"they think this will bring down the president; that's what this is all about.\"\n\nAt a campaign rally on Friday evening in South Carolina, the president denounced Democrats, describing the concerns they have expressed about the virus as \"their new hoax\" after the Russia investigation and then impeachment. \"Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,\" he said. \"We did one of the great jobs. How's President Trump doing? They go, 'Not good.' They do not have any clue. They cannot even count the votes in Iowa. No, they can't.\"\n\nThe accusations came as other elements of the federal government moved to head off a broader wave of infections like those in China. The State Department urged Americans to reconsider traveling to Italy, where the virus has spread, and health officials reported a second case of unknown origin in California, raising fears of local transmission. The World Health Organization reported cases in 56 countries and warned of a \"very high\" global risk, while stock markets closed their worst week since the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general said that it would begin a \"comprehensive review\" of the federal government's coronavirus response, speeding up a process that had already been underway to monitor how the health agency was organizing its resources for a potential domestic outbreak.\n\nWhile other presidents in moments like this have sought to transcend politics and assert national leadership, Mr. Trump has framed the issue in partisan terms while playing down the risk to the United States. Privately he has been consumed by concern that his enemies will use the coronavirus and the economic impact it has against him as he seeks re-election.\n\nDemocrats said that Mr. Trump was making the crisis all about himself rather than the American public. \"For Mick Mulvaney to suggest that Americans turn off their TVs and bury their heads in the sand when they're worried about a global health pandemic is Orwellian, counterproductive, dangerous and would be repeating China's mistake,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.\n\nTensions over the issue flared on Friday even at a congressional hearing on Iran when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was quickly hit with questions about the coronavirus rather than the Jan. 3 drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the head of Iran's elite security forces.\n\nDemocrats argued that the virus posed a greater threat to Americans than General Suleimani, and Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island asserted that the Trump administration had not been forthcoming about the real risks each presented.\n\n\"Because of the dishonesty from this administration on this and many other issues, Americans have lost trust in their government,\" Mr. Cicilline told the secretary. \"Now we're facing a serious global health crisis in the form of the coronavirus and trust is more important than ever.\"\n\nMr. Pompeo bristled at what he considered a political ambush. \"We agreed that I'd come today to talk about Iran, and the first question today is not about Iran,\" he complained.\n\nRepublicans defended Mr. Pompeo by going on offense against the Democrats. \"This hearing is a joke,\" declared Representative Lee Zeldin of New York.\n\nWith Vice President Mike Pence now leading the response to the virus, the administration has moved to coordinate its communication with the public, but officials on Friday sought to dispel the impression that they were clamping down on scientific information or limiting the availability of experts whose tone has suggested more alarm than the president's.\n\nIn a briefing with congressional officials on Friday morning, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that he \"was not muzzled\" by Mr. Pence's office, but he did say he had to get permission for roughly a half-dozen television appearances that had already been planned.\n\nAdministration officials held a briefing at the White House featuring Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, along with Russell T. Vought, the budget director, and Eric Ueland, the White House legislative director. After each official read off a series of prepared talking points, they took only a handful of questions from journalists.\n\nOf the three officials, Mr. Azar went the furthest in suggesting that the United States might face a difficult next phase of the coronavirus, if it spreads. Mr. Trump has repeatedly told advisers he is concerned that Mr. Azar and others in the administration are presenting an \"alarmist\" view.\n\n\"The administration has ignored or sidelined expert staff at agencies like the C.D.C. and the N.I.H., offered the public inconsistent and confusing information, and failed to provide clear leadership,\" said Dr. Kathleen Rest, the executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists and a health policy expert, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMr. Pence went to Florida on Friday for a previously scheduled fund-raiser for the state's Republican delegation, although he planned to give a briefing to Gov. Ron DeSantis while there. He also stopped by the radio broadcaster Rush Limbaugh's studio to insist that the administration was not focused on politics.\n\n\"Washington is always going to have a political reflexive response to things,\" Mr. Pence said. \"But we're going to tune that out.\"\n\nMr. Limbaugh has been among the conservative commentators who have blamed the media and political opponents for over-covering the coronavirus, which he compared to the common cold. \"It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump,\" Mr. Limbaugh, who was recently given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Mr. Trump, said on his show on Monday.\n\nThat theme has been amplified by some of the president's favorite Fox News hosts like Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham in recent days and animated Mr. Mulvaney's appearance at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., on Friday.\n\n\"The reason you're seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,\" Mr. Mulvaney \"That's what this is all about it.\"\n\nMr. Mulvaney noted that the administration took action weeks ago to prevent a public health emergency by limiting travel from China, where the worst outbreak has centered. \"Why didn't you hear about it?\" Mr. Mulvaney asked. \"What was still going on four or five weeks ago? Impeachment, that's all the press wanted to talk about.\"\n\nThe news media, in fact, has been covering the global spread of coronavirus intensively for months, including the Trump administration's travel restrictions.\n\nFollowing the president's lead, Mr. Mulvaney also minimized concerns over the virus. \"The flu kills people,\" he said. \"This is not Ebola. It's not SARS, it's not MERS. It's not a death sentence, it's not the same as the Ebola crisis.\"\n\nMr. Trump sounded off to reporters as he left the White House for the campaign rally in South Carolina. \"They're doing everything they can to instill fear in people, and I think it's ridiculous,\" Mr. Trump said of CNN and other news outlets. \"And some of the Democrats are doing it the way it should be done, but some of them are trying to gain political favor by saying a lot of untruths.\"\n\nThat message was quickly picked up and repeated at the conservative conference. \"It's overblown in the media,\" said Lee Murphy, a congressional candidate in Delaware and actor who played a defense secretary once on \"House of Cards.\". \"They want to get at President Trump every chance they can, but this should not be political. I'm tired of it being overblown and being political.\"\n\nJeff Jordan, running for Congress in Virginia, said too much has been made of coronavirus, which he compared to the common flu. \"The media at large is not a fan of the president,\" Mr. Jordan said. \"The media will take any opportunity they can to cause damage.\"\n\nOn Capitol Hill, the attacks on coverage drew scorn from Democrats. \"The problem is the American people need to be able to trust that their government will tell them the truth, no matter what the truth is,\" said Representative Andy Levin of Michigan. \"And I'm very concerned that the American people cannot trust this government.\"\n\nTony Fratto, who served as deputy press secretary to President George W. Bush during multiple crises, including the last time the stock markets fell so far so fast, said blaming others in such a situation is counterproductive and urged the White House to keep its attention on the underlying issue.\n\n\"Focus only on health and safety and I know they don't believe this, but if they keep Americans safe they will definitely get credit for it,\" he said. \"Because of the White House's attacks, if things do go poorly they're going to be blamed for taking their eye off the ball even if they've done all the right things.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman,
