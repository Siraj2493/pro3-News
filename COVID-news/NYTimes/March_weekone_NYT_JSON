Goklany, a longtime Interior Department employee who, in 2017 near the start of the Trump administration, was promoted to the office of the deputy secretary with responsibility for reviewing the agency's climate policies. The Interior Department's scientific work is the basis for critical decisions about water and mineral rights affecting millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of acres of land.\n\nThe wording, known internally as the \"Goks uncertainty language\" based on Mr. Goklany's nickname, inaccurately claims that there is a lack of consensus among scientists that the earth is warming. In Interior Department emails to scientists, Mr. Goklany pushed misleading interpretations of climate science, saying it \"may be overestimating the rate of global warming, for whatever reason;\" climate modeling has largely predicted global warming accurately. The final language states inaccurately that some studies have found the earth to be warming, while others have not.\n\nHe also instructed department scientists to add that rising carbon dioxide -- the main force driving global warming -- is beneficial because it \"may increase plant water use efficiency\" and \"lengthen the agricultural growing season.\" Both assertions misrepresent the scientific consensus that, overall, climate change will result in severe disruptions to global agriculture and significant reductions in crop yields.\n\nSamuel Myers, a principal research scientist at Harvard University's Center for the Environment who has studied the effects of climate change on nutrition, said the language \"takes very specific and isolated pieces of science, and tries to expand it in an extraordinarily misleading fashion.\"\n\nThe Interior Department's emails, dating from 2017 through last year and obtained under public-records laws by the watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute, provide the latest evidence of the Trump administration's widespread attacks on government scientific work. The administration has halted or scaled back numerous research projects since taking office, including an Obama-era initiative to fight disease outbreaks around the world -- a decision that has drawn criticism in recent weeks as a deadly coronavirus has spread globally.\n\nThe Interior Department referred questions to the Bureau of Reclamation, the office that oversees the nation's dams and water resources and the first to publish the language. \"Uncertainty is a part of climate modeling, as it is with all scientific modeling,\" said Marlon Duke, the bureau's acting public affairs chief. He said the bureau did not have a formal requirement to include specific language in any document, \"but we strive to be fully transparent in recognizing and sharing appropriate uncertainties in the information we use to make decisions.\"\n\nThe Interior Department declined to make Mr. Goklany available for an interview, and he did not return requests seeking comment.\n\nThe misleading language appears in environmental studies and impact statements affecting major watersheds including the Klamath and Upper Deschutes river basins in California and Oregon, which provide critical habitat for spawning salmon and other wildlife. In addition, millions of acres of farms in California's agriculturally important Central Valley are supplied, in part, by the Klamath, which is California's second-largest river by volume and is only slightly smaller than the Colorado River. Thirsty farms there have used increasing amounts of water at a rate that scientists say hurts wildlife and imperils the salmon industry.\n\nFor climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\n\nScientists and policy experts say that, by embedding an inaccurate sense of uncertainty about scientific findings in its documents, the Trump administration is advancing its policy of weakening environmental rules and reallocating vast quantities of water to farming and irrigation, even though climate change projections show that use to be unsustainable. This month, President Trump signed a memo in California relaxing regulations that have limited the flow of water to irrigate the Central Valley's big farms.\n\n\"Highlighting uncertainty is consistent with the biggest attacks on the climate science community,\" said Jacquelyn Gill, an associate professor of paleoecology and plant ecology at the University of Maine. \"They're emphasizing discussions of uncertainty to the point where people feel as though we can't actually make decisions\" based on the research.\n\nMr. Goklany has been employed by the Interior Department since the 1980s, much of that time in less influential positions focused on policy analysis. He has also written papers for and participated in events hosted by conservative think tanks including the Cato Institute and the Heartland Institute, which have spread doubt about the scientific consensus that human activity is causing the world to warm rapidly. In 2009, he appeared as an expert voice in a film titled \"Policy Peril: Why Global Warming Policies are More Dangerous than Global Warming Itself.\"\n\nBut Mr. Goklany's Interior Department responsibilities expanded substantially in the early months of the Trump administration, when he was elevated by Trump appointees to a position guiding the Interior Department's climate policy and began attending senior-level meetings and weighing in on early policy moves such as changes to the department's website. However, the details of his role in the agency's scientific work, including pressing scientists to include misleading climate language in critical policy documents, wasn't previously known.\n\nIn interviews, four current and former Interior Department officials said Mr. Goklany's rise was abrupt and unexpected.\n\n\"They were like, 'Who the hell is this guy?'\" said Joel Clement, a former top climate-policy expert at the Interior Department who quit in 2017 and testified in Congress that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was purging the agency of government scientists working to address climate change -- allegations later backed by the agency's inspector general. Mr. Clement is now a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Mr. Zinke has denied the allegations.\n\nThe new documents show that, as early as September 2017, Mr. Goklany, newly appointed to the office of the deputy secretary, started directing scientists to add climate uncertainty language in agency reports. In an exchange with scientists at the Bureau of Reclamation, dated Sept. 12 of that year, Mr. Goklany ordered up uncertainty language that the emails say would be included in future studies of river basins, and he directly edited the file.\n\n\"My edits are on the attached,\" Mr. Goklany wrote in the email, sending a marked up draft that contained the misleading references to the benefits of higher carbon dioxide levels and that questioned the widely accepted scientific research projecting the future course of climate change. He also included an abstract of a paper, indicating, he wrote, \"that CO2 may have increased the water use efficiency of plants globally.\"\n\nIn December of that same year, he gave a presentation at the Interior Department promoting the benefits of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide to human and environmental well-being, according to presentation slides viewed by The Times.\n\nBy early 2018, the emails show, the bureau had adopted a de facto requirement that studies reference climate uncertainty. \"Attached here is the latest draft of the 'uncertainty' language that Dave Raff and others worked on with the Department, to be included in all Basin Studies from here forward,\" Avra Morgan, a watershed management official, wrote on Jan. 26, 2018, in a email to more than a dozen bureau scientists.\n\nThe Interior Department's scientists pushed back with some success against Mr. Goklany's demands, the emails show. Amanda Erath, program coordinator of the Bureau of Reclamation's water recycling and reuse projects, wrote in an email on Feb. 4, 2019, that more scientifically \"robust uncertainty language\" had been negotiated. In another email, she referred to the wording as the \"Goks uncertainty language.\"\n\nThe final language seemed \"balanced enough, especially since it does mention potential adverse effects of warming on water resources,\" wrote Ralph F. Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in an email. Nevertheless, Mr. Keeling -- who was the lead author of the study cited by Mr. Goklany finding that more carbon dioxide helps plants use water more efficiently -- also noted that the text \"might have mentioned that warming may increase the water requirements for plant growth, which counters the CO2 impact on water-use efficiency.\"\n\nBoth scientists and environmental groups are concerned that Mr. Goklany's campaign will start to build a body of evidence that will undermine the agency's response to climate change in a region where water is already a highly contested resource. The language could \"create a loophole that would prevent future legal challenges from succeeding,\" said Jayson O'Neill, deputy director of Western Values Project, a public-lands advocacy group.\n\nIn the Klamath River Basin in Southern Oregon and Northern California, for example, the federal government is set to make a decision on whether to remove four hydroelectric dams that block about 400 miles of habitat for migratory salmon and steelhead trout. However, as climate change reduces the water available for irrigation there, some farmers have opposed the dam removals, fearing they will get even less water.\n\nThe Interior Department reports expressing uncertainty about the risks of global warming \"become part of the record\" supporting that argument, said Kristen Boyles, Seattle-based attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice, which is involved in court cases opposing more irrigation. \"They'll be able to say, 'We're not going to consider climate change.'\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hiroko_tabuchi@nytimes.com", "name": "Hiroko Tabuchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indur_M._Goklany", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indur M.

The death was the second on U.S. soil from the virus; the first also occurred at that hospital.\n\nOne-quarter of the city's firefighters were in quarantine on Sunday because they had been to the nursing facility. A nearby college spent the day cleansing its campus because students had visited the facility. The local hospital asked visitors to stay away.\n\nBeyond Kirkland, the King County authorities announced two additional coronavirus cases earlier in the day that were unrelated to the nursing home; those patients were in critical condition at hospitals in Seattle and Renton. Officials were scrambling to assess the risks emerging in schools, medical centers and the major employers that call the region home.\n\nThe fear and confusion at the nursing facility and throughout the county presented a vivid and disturbing picture of how much uncertainty surrounds the virus and how many people have the potential to be affected.\n\nElsewhere in the country, the states of New York and Rhode Island each reported their first cases, both linked to recent foreign travel.\n\nThe nursing facility in Kirkland, run by Life Care Centers of America, is full of elderly residents who can be especially vulnerable to respiratory illnesses. Records show that the center has a recent history of illness outbreaks and of difficulty following infection control precautions.\n\nRelatives who had recently visited the facility said it had been coping with illness among residents and staff in recent days, and told all its residents on Friday to stay in their rooms. For a facility of communal living -- with a shared dining facility, group movie nights and friends who visit with one another in the halls -- that decision prompted concerns among residents and families.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak How Is the U.S. Being Affected?\n\nUpdated Feb. 29, 2020\n\nA person in King County, Washington, near Seattle, has become the first known death in this country after contracting the coronavirus At least 73 people in the U.S. have been infected with the virus, with some newer cases not believed to be connected to recent overseas travel or contact with a person known to be infected. If you live in California here's what you need to know. An outbreak would test the American education system. Few schools have detailed plans to teach online if schools were closed for long periods. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread in the U.S. Some lawmakers questioned whether the nation is prepared. Can a state force a city to house coronavirus patients? A federal judge ruled that Costa Mesa, Calif., does not have to, at least for now. The outbreak has left some Asian-Americans feeling an unsettling level of public scrutiny. A look at how local health departments are struggling to monitor thousands of people returning to the U.S. from China. A woman returning from Wuhan, China, gave us a look at life inside a coronavirus quarantine center in the U.S. An Omaha hospital that drew attention for treating Ebola patients is now playing a key role again. Most experts agree: To protect yourself wash your hands and avoid touching your face. We want to hear from parents, teachers and administrators about how their schools are preparing for the virus. Mask hoarders may increase the risk of an outbreak in the U.S. Health care workers risk infection if they cannot get the protective gear.\n\nBut even more troubling news followed on Saturday: A resident and an employee had tested positive. The facility later posted a statement on its website saying it had stopped allowing any visitors, including relatives and volunteers.\n\nBridget Parkhill said her 77-year-old mother is a resident who has been sick for several days, but has not been taken to the hospital because she does not have a fever or respiratory distress.\n\n\"I'm extremely worried,\" Ms. Parkhill said.\n\nMore than a month ago, Washington State reported the nation's first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus. The state then went weeks without any more positive tests, but only a few dozen potential cases were tested in that period.\n\nThat has changed dramatically in recent days, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded testing criteria last week to allow tests of people with severe respiratory illness that was otherwise unexplained, and not just people who were severely ill and had been to China or had been in contact with another known patient. And the state swiftly began to find more coronavirus cases.\n\n\"What prompted us to start looking is a change in the testing criteria,\" said Dr. Francis Riedo, an infectious diseases specialist at EvergreenHealth, a public hospital district in northern King County and southern Snohomish County, where the first patient to die of the coronavirus in the United States was treated.\n\nDr. Riedo said that the positive tests among hospital patients were what he described as \"the tip of the iceberg\" -- the most severely ill patients were being tested, but many others with less severe illness could be out in the community with undetected infections.\n\nDr. Scott Lindquist, epidemiologist for communicable diseases with the Washington State Department of Health, said that he was aware of cases in which physicians suspected coronavirus and could not get the patients tested before the change in criteria, though he did not know how many such cases there had been. Dr. Lindquist said the state laboratory was rapidly ramping up to be able to perform 200 tests a day.\n\n\"We're really aggressively sampling in Washington State now, because we feel like it has been here and we haven't had the ability to lab test,\" Dr. Lindquist said.\n\nDr. Delaney Ruston, a primary care physician in Seattle, said she had seen a patient last week with a low-grade fever who had been in China about three weeks earlier. She said public health officials told her the patient did not meet criteria for testing because the patient had been away from China for more than two weeks. Even so, Dr. Ruston wondered whether the patient, who wore a mask in the clinic to protect others and had no cough, could have had a mild case of the illness.\n\n\"All of us are in dire need for a point-of-care test,\" she said, meaning a test that can be performed quickly on site, which is done currently for seasonal influenza.\n\nGenetic researchers said on Sunday that they had found strong indications that the virus has been quietly spreading in the region through people who were not known to be infected. The researchers analyzed the genomes of the virus found in two people in Snohomish County tested about six weeks apart, and concluded that the cases were very likely linked, even though there seemed to be no way that either could have directly infected the other.\n\nThe two people were not known to have come in contact, and the second did not contract the virus until several weeks after the first -- the initial case detected in the country -- would probably no longer have been contagious. The researchers said that based on the time elapsed between the two cases and other factors, whatever chain of infection connected the two cases could have affected hundreds of other people as well.\n\nThe more recent of those two cases was not initially suspected to be coronavirus, and was detected through a nasal-swab sample collected to test the patient for influenza and shared with the Seattle Flu Study. The sample was also checked for other illnesses including coronavirus.\n\nDr. Lindquist said that of about 1,000 Seattle Flu Study swab samples -- which were tested in the last week by the Brotman Baty Institute and the Northwest Genomics Center -- only one had tested positive for coronavirus. \"It's not like it's super prevalent,\" Dr. Lindquist said.\n\nIt's unclear when the coronavirus reached the Life Care nursing facility in Kirkland.\n\nKenny McMillan, 60, was receiving rehabilitative treatment at the center for a broken foot in February when he started to feel sick. He has long suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the physical toll on his body from a lifetime of jobs mulching tree trunks and working in warehouses and assembly lines. So he was particularly vulnerable when he started feeling what he described as \"flu symptoms -- pneumonia symptoms\" that got to be life-threatening about two weeks ago.\n\n\"All of a sudden one night, they came in and they couldn't revive me, because I was out of it,\" Mr. McMillan said. \"If they hadn't have revived me, I probably would've been gone. That's the only reason I'm here.\"\n\nHe said he was transferred to EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland and was moved in and out of the intensive-care unit as his oxygen levels and heart rate fluctuated. He said he was moved to an isolation room around when the news broke about two coronavirus cases at the nursing home, and was tested Saturday night for the virus; he was waiting for the results.\n\nAs he spoke, he coughed and had to pause to catch his breath. \"Hold on, I gotta take a deep breath, slow it down a bit,\" he said. \"It's been a nightmare.\"\n\nFear and uncertainty quickly rippled outward through the networks of family members and friends of patients and staff at the nursing home. Mr. McMillan's ex-wife had been there frequently to help care for him and had recently returned to fetch a plastic boot he needed for his broken right foot. She said she was now worried that she and her family could have been exposed. So, too, were friends she had visited over the past weeks, like Michelle Mackey, who said on Sunday that she felt all right but was unsure whether she should return to her grocery-store job on Monday.\n\n\"It's crazy how this thing can be spread around and you don't even know,\" Ms. Mackey said. \"I don't know what to do.\"\n\nMs. Parkhill's sister, Carmen Gray, said her mother reported Sunday morning that people were now wearing masks and protective gear when they brought her meals, but she had still not been tested for coronavirus.\n\n\"Since she has been sick for days and been around all these people, I don't understand why she's not being tested, if for nothing else to rule her out,\" Ms. Gray said.\n\nThe Life Care nursing facility has been cited over infection control issues in the past. In 2019, a state investigation found that Life Care had failed to ensure that its staff was aware of and followed \"transmission-based precautions\" as required by federal regulations. Investigators said a report issued by the facility in March 2019, showed that it had had two influenza outbreaks that sickened at least 17 residents and 7 employees.\n\nState inspectors recorded seeing a resident's oxygen mask, nebulizer and oxygen tubing jumbled up with a bed cover sheet and the resident's socks in March 2019, even though a registered nurse said that the items should be \"bagged for infection control.\" The next day, the same nurse walked into the resident's room without any protective equipment, despite a sign outside the room ordering staff to wear a mask, gown and gloves while inside, according to the state inspection report.\n\nThe report also noted that a staff member had been seen stacking clean dishes after loading dirty ones in a dishwasher, without washing their hands in between.\n\nLife Care said in response to the state report that it would teach its staff more about transmission precautions, controlling infections and hand hygiene. Two months later, the state wrote to the center to say that the errors had been corrected and that as of June 2019, it was compliant with all regulations.\n\nMedicare rates the facility highly overall, giving it five out of five stars; however, its Medicare health inspection rating last year was only three out of five stars, considered average.\n\nPat Herrick said her mother has been at Life Care in Kirkland for seven years. While it was not uncommon for a spreading flu to prompt the facility to take strict precautions, Ms. Herrick said, she was impressed with how Life Care leaders have handled the issues in the past, and appreciated their candor in handling the coronavirus.\n\nMs. Herrick said her mother has not been sick, but even so, she said she was concerned about what could happen if her mother catches the virus.\n\n\"The level of danger for her could be significant,\" Ms. Herrick said. \"She is 89 years old. It could take her.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_baker@nytimes.com", "name": "Mike Baker", "type": "author",

"title": "Nurses Battling Coronavirus Beg for Protective Gear and Better Planning", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nNurses in two states who are responding to the onslaught of novel coronavirus cases said in interviews this week that they lack protective equipment, training on how to use whatever equipment they have been given, and clear protocols to keep themselves and their patients safe.\n\nSome nurses in the two states, Washington State and California, said they have been asked to watch online videos -- rather than have in-person training -- about how to spot the virus and how to put on and take off hazmat suits. Others said they have had to beg for N95 masks, which are thicker and block out much smaller particles than surgical masks do. And still others said they have faced ridicule when expressing concerns about catching the highly contagious virus.\n\n\"If nurses aren't safe, then really our community isn't safe,\" said Jenny Managhebi, a clinical nurse at the University of California Davis Medical Center, where 24 nurses were asked to self-quarantine after a patient tested positive for the virus. \"If I'm not safe at the bedside, when I come home to my husband and my children, then they're not safe.\"\n\nThe concerns of American nurses come in the wake of the well-publicized deaths of medical professionals in Wuhan, China, where the new coronavirus first surfaced late last year.\n\nHealth care workers are among the groups most at risk of contracting the virus, as sick people report to emergency rooms and are treated before their condition is known. At least eight people who work in health care facilities have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three employees of a hospital in Vacaville, Calif., and at least five people who worked at the Life Care long-term care facility in Kirkland, Wash.\n\nAnd health care workers who are exposed to it can also unwittingly transmit the virus.\n\nAt Evergreen Hospital in Washington, where at least seven deaths have occurred, nurses who were told to self-quarantine were later asked to return to work, according to the Washington State Nurses Association, raising fears that they could further spread the virus if they had contracted it.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nThe association, which represents more than 16,000 registered nurses in the state, surveyed its members and reported that 40 percent of the nurses who responded said they lacked access to adequate protective equipment. And more than half said they did not feel prepared to provide care for a patient with known or suspected case of the virus, which causes a disease known as Covid-19.\n\nThe union said nurses at other hospitals around the state have also reported concerns about lack of equipment. \"Some have expressed concern that they themselves or colleagues have been in close contact with Covid-19 patients and yet are being told to continue working,\" the union said.\n\nThe California Nurses Association, a statewide union that has grown into the largest organization of nurses in the country, with representation of 155,000 nurses, is scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday afternoon to demand access to \"the highest level of protection\" for nurses on the front lines. It also plans to demand training and clear plans for how to handle patients suspected of having the virus.\n\n\"Employers shall plan for a surge of patients with possible or confirmed Covid-19, including plans to isolate, cohort, and to provide safe staffing,\" the union said in a statement. \"Any nurse/health care worker who is exposed to Covid-19 will be placed on precautionary leave for at least 14 days and will maintain pay and other benefits during the full length of that leave.\"\n\nSome nurses at other hospitals have reported being asked to take their personal paid leave to cover periods of mandatory quarantine. California has one of the strictest nurse-to-patient ratios in the country, with one nurse for every two sick patients. Some nurses said they were concerned that hospitals would struggle to meet that quotient if too many were forced into quarantine.\n\nTraining for how to use protective gear, nurses said, is almost as important as the gear itself, because taking it off incorrectly can result in spreading dangerous fluids from a sick patient.\n\n\"It used to be that you'd get a full day training,\" said Gerard Brogan, the director of nursing practice at the California Nurses Association. \"Now, they will send a nurse and doctor to the internet to learn how to don and doff a hazmat suit.\"\n\nA nurse at a hospital run by Tenet Healthcare in Orange County who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals, said staff members have not been told what to do if a possible coronavirus patient walks into the emergency room. The nurse said some doctors have ridiculed staff who have raised concerns.\n\n\"It's been pretty disturbing what is happening,\" said the nurse, who is among the most experienced nurses at the hospital. \"Some doctors have been walking through the hospital for weeks with respirator masks. Others have been brushing it off like, 'If you think this is a big deal, you are a conspiracy theorist and you are weak.'\"\n\nMs. Managhebi, the clinical nurse in California, said nurses have asked that N95 masks be made available on the supply carts in their units, rather than having to ask a manager or an assistant manager for one, as is the current practice.\n\nShe also said nurses wanted the UC Davis hospital to adopt a detailed set of protocols about how they should handle suspected coronavirus cases, similar to a plan for Ebola that stipulated everything from the elevator that would be used to transport a patient to the specific staff members who would treat the patient.\n\nBut, Ms. Managhebi said, \"They responded to our request and said it wasn't necessary at this time.\"\n\nMitch

"title": "Coronavirus in N.Y.: Driver for Taxi or Ride Services Tests Positive", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nA man who drives for taxi or ride-hailing services in Queens has tested positive for the coronavirus, and the discovery of the new case prompted more than 40 doctors, nurses and other workers at a hospital there to go into self-quarantine over concerns that they might have been exposed, officials said on Saturday.\n\nThe man, 33, walked into St. John's Episcopal Hospital in the Far Rockaway section of Queens on Tuesday and reported flu-like symptoms. He went home and returned later when his symptoms worsened, an official said.\n\nOn Friday night, the man tested positive for the coronavirus. Dozens of workers at the hospital are now in isolation and are being tested.\n\n\"This is a new case,\" said Councilman Donovan Richards Jr., a Democrat who represents Far Rockaway. \"And the first in Queens.\"\n\n\"Obviously, 40 people are out,\" Mr. Richards said. \"The hospital will need to replace those people temporarily. They will need money to do that. They need supplies. We need to keep the health care up and running.\"\n\nTom Melillo, a hospital spokesman, said the patient remained in quarantine at the hospital on Saturday.\n\nMr. Melillo said hospital officials are monitoring everyone who may have been exposed to the patient.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the man drives a yellow taxi or works for ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft.\n\nHealth officials said they were also seeking to determine whether the driver may have exposed passengers.\n\nNew York State now has nearly 50 people who have tested positive for the illness, most of them in Westchester County, just north of New York City.\n\nThe new case in Queens appears to put the total for the city at five.\n\nOn Friday, New York City officials asked the federal government to send more diagnostic kits for the coronavirus, saying in a letter that the city's limited capacity to test had \"impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.\"\n\nPublic health workers and government officials have linked a majority of the state's cases to a cluster in Westchester that first came to the authorities' attention after a New Rochelle resident was confirmed as New York's second coronavirus patient.\n\nIn tracing people who had contact with the man, a partner at a small Midtown Manhattan law firm, disease detectives learned that he had attended synagogue services before becoming infected.\n\nPublic health officials closed the synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, and asked that anyone who had attended services, a bat mitzvah or a funeral there recently isolate themselves as a precaution.\n\nAs of Friday, New York officials said they had asked about 4,000 people in the state who might have been exposed to the virus to isolate themselves at home.\n\nAbout 2,700 of that group were in New York City, and most of them had recently returned from five countries where the outbreak has been most severe: China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea.\n\nAt least 44 people in New York State had been placed under mandatory quarantine as of Friday, including 33 in Westchester County, nine in New York City, one in Nassau County on Long Island and one in Erie County in Western New York.\n\nNew Jersey officials said on Friday that four people in the state had tested positive for the virus: a 32-year-old man, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 30s, all from Bergen County near New York; and a man in his 60s from Camden County, in the southern part of the state.\n\nAlso on Friday, Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut said that an employee of a Danbury hospital who lives in Westchester County had tested positive for the virus.\n\nAs of Saturday, the coronavirus outbreak had sickened more than 102,000 people, killed nearly 3,500 and been detected in at least 92 countries.\n\nIn the United States, more than 300 cases of the virus had been confirmed, and at least 17 people had died,

all the authority they need, and will provide specific guidance to their troops as the situation continues to evolve,\" Mr. Esper said. \"My No. 1 priority remains to protect our forces and their families.\"\n\nGen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Defense Department was trying to plan for all possible scenarios related to coronavirus, including the possibility that the disease could become a global pandemic.\n\n\"The United States military looks at a wide variety of scenarios,\" General Milley said at the news conference with Mr. Esper. He said military laboratories were working on a vaccine.\n\nThe Defense Department's response is important because the American military has more than 75,000 troops stationed in countries that are experiencing outbreaks, including South Korea, Japan, Italy and Bahrain. Several American bases sit next to cities where the virus is spreading, and those bases employ civilian workers. Many American troops live off base as well. Last week, an American soldier in South Korea tested positive for the virus, the military's first active-duty case.\n\nDuring the news conference, General Milley said American troops were particularly well prepared to face the virus because the U.S. military for the most part tended to be young and healthy.\n\nBut the Pentagon nonetheless has canceled several joint military exercises, including in South Korea and in Israel, because of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe U.S. military is going ahead with another set of exercises -- one of its largest in recent years in Europe.

Stop touching your face!\n\nOne of the more difficult challenges in public health has been to teach people to wash their hands frequently and to stop touching the facial mucous membranes -- the eyes, nose and mouth, all entry portals for the new coronavirus and many other germs.\n\n\"Scratching the nose, rubbing your eyes, leaning on your chin and your fingers go next to your mouth -- there's multiple ways we do it,\" said Dr. Nancy C. Elder, a professor of family medicine at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland who has studied face touching among doctors and clinic staff members. \"Everybody touches their face, and it's a difficult habit to break.\"\n\nAs communities prepare for the spread of coronavirus around the globe, the primary advice from health officials is for people to wash their hands. But a number of health researchers say the public health message also should include a more forceful warning about face touching.\n\n\"The C.D.C. and W.H.O. still say something like 'avoid' touching your eyes, nose and mouth,\" said Dr. William P. Sawyer, a family physician in Sharonville, Ohio, and creator of HenrytheHand.com, which promotes hand and face hygiene. \"The advice should be 'absolutely do not touch them!' If you never touch your facial mucous membranes, you're less likely to be sick again from any viral respiratory infection.\"\n\nTo understand why hand hygiene and face touching can make a meaningful difference during a pandemic, consider how a virus can spread. An infected person rides in an elevator, touching buttons both outside and inside the elevator or maybe sneezing during the ride. When that person leaves, microscopic droplets containing the virus stay behind. The next people who press the same buttons or touch a surface pick up the virus on their hands, then scratch their noses or rub their eyes.\n\n\"Eyes, nose, mouth -- all those mucous membranes are the portal into the body for a virus like Covid-19 or SARS,\" said Mary-Louise McLaws, professor of epidemiology, health care infection and infectious diseases control at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.\n\n\"I was in a conference yesterday watching people, and in just about two minutes I counted a dozen times that I saw someone touching mucous membranes,\" Dr. McLaws said. \"It is a very common practice. We rub our eyes, scratch our nose, touch our mouth -- the general community needs to be aware of how often they are touching their face.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Answers to your most common questions:\n\nUpdated Feb. 26, 2020\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How worried should I be?\n\nNew outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are renewing fears of a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that Americans should brace for the likelihood that the virus will spread to the United States. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe C.D.C. has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan, Italy and Iran. The agency also has advised against all nonessential travel to South Korea and China. How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n\nKeep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand. Have a support system in place for elderly family members. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 80,000 people in at least 33 countries, including Italy, Iran and South Korea. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is probably transmitted through sneezes, coughs and contaminated surfaces. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have been working with officials in China, where growth has slowed. But this week, as confirmed cases spiked on two continents, experts warned that the world was not ready for a major outbreak.\n\nDr. McLaws was the senior author of a 2015 study on face touching that documented the alarming number of times we do it. While medical students attended a lecture, the researchers filmed them and counted the number of times they touched any part of their faces. Over the course of an hour, students touched their faces, on average, 23 times. Nearly half of the touches were to the eyes, nose or mouth -- what infectious disease researchers call \"the T-zone.\"\n\nOther studies of primary care doctors, people doing office work, and students riding a simulated rail car have all found similar rates of touching the T-zone.\n\n\"I was really surprised,\" Dr. McLaws said. \"By touching your mucous membranes, you're giving a virus 11 opportunities every hour if you've touched something infectious.\"\n\nThe risk of picking up a virus by hand-to-face contact depends on a number of factors, including the type of virus, whether the surface was nonporous, how long ago the virus was left behind, how much time the infected person spent in the area and the temperature and humidity levels.\n\nThe World Health Organization notes that while we don't know how long the new coronavirus survives on surfaces, it seems to behave like other coronaviruses -- which is unsettling news. A recent study from the Journal of Hospital Infection found that similar coronaviruses have been shown to survive on surfaces for as long as nine days under ideal conditions. That's far longer than the flu virus, which typically can survive under ideal conditions only up to 24 hours on hard surfaces. Public Health England says that, based on studies of other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, \"the risk of picking up a live virus from a contaminated surface\" under real-life conditions \"is likely to be reduced significantly after 72 hours.\"\n\nIn general, a virus will survive the longest on nonporous surfaces made of metal and plastics -- including door knobs, counters and railings. A virus will die sooner on fabrics or tissues. Once on your hand, a virus begins to lose potency, but it will probably live long enough for you to touch your face. Although more study is needed of coronavirus, in one study of rhinovirus, which causes the common cold, a small dose of virus was placed on a participant's finger. An hour later, about 40 percent of the virus was still viable. After three hours, 16 percent could still be detected.\n\nWe also know from the 2003 epidemic of SARS, a more deadly coronavirus than the one currently spreading, that the virus was often transmitted from surface contact. In one Hong Kong hotel, an infected doctor who checked into his room on the ninth floor before going to the hospital for treatment left a trail of virus that infected at least seven people who also had rooms on the ninth floor, who then went on to spread the disease elsewhere. The doctor, who died from the infection, was later identified as a \"super spreader\" linked to about 4,000 cases of SARS that occurred during the epidemic.\n\nThe good news is that frequent hand washing can make a meaningful difference in lowering your risk. During the SARS epidemic, hand-washing reduced the risk of transmission by 30 to 50 percent. But after washing your hands, you must still be mindful about face touching, Dr. Sawyer said.\n\n\"Your hands are only clean until the next surface you touch,\" he said. \"When you reach for the door knob or hand railing, you've recontaminated your hand with something. If you touch your mucous membranes, then you could inoculate yourself inadvertently with that organism. If there is one behavior change that could prevent infection, it's do not touch your T-zone.\"\n\nBut it's not easy to stop face touching. In fact, many people say that the more they think about it, the more their eyes twitch and their nose itches. A number of memes have emerged on social media from people who say that ever since the warnings about coronavirus, they can't stop touching their own faces.\n\nOnly humans and a few primates (gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzees) are known to touch their faces with little or no awareness of the habit. (Most animals touch their faces only to groom or swat away a pest.) German researchers analyzed the brain's electrical activity before and after spontaneous face touching, and their findings suggested that we touch our faces as a way to relieve stress and manage our emotions.\n\nTo break the face-touching habit, try using a tissue if you need to scratch your nose or rub your eyes. Wearing makeup may reduce face touching, since it may make you more mindful of not smudging it. One study found that women touched their faces far less when they wore makeup. Another solution: Try to identify triggers for face touching, like dry skin or itchy eyes, and use moisturizers or eye drops to treat those conditions so you are less likely to rub or scratch your face.\n\nIt also may help to wear glasses to create a barrier to touching your eyes. Gloves or mittens can also make you more mindful of not touching your face (and can make it more difficult to put your finger in your nose or your eye.). Although gloves, too, can become contaminated, viruses don't live as long on fabric or leather.\n\nGiven that face touching is a long-ingrained habit, it makes sense to remain vigilant about frequent hand washing and wipe down your desk, phones and community surfaces. Carry hand sanitizer and use it often. The more mindful you are about regular hand washing, the more mindful you will be about your hands and what they are touching.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

"title": "Criticized for Coronavirus Response, Trump Points to Obama Administration", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Trump sought to deflect criticism of his administration's response to the coronavirus onto his predecessor on Wednesday, complaining that a federal regulation adopted under President Barack Obama made it harder to enact widespread testing for the virus.\n\n\"The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place at a much more accurate and rapid fashion,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That was a decision we disagreed with. I don't think we would have made it, but for some reason it was made. But we've undone that decision.\"\n\nNo coronavirus issue has attracted as much attention as testing, which even now has lagged behind other countries dealing with the virus. Local health agencies have complained that a lack of coronavirus tests have hindered their abilities to identify patients, and tight restrictions imposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on who could be tested have meant that some infected patients waited days before a diagnosis.\n\nThe last of those restrictions were lifted by Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Trump raised the testing issue during a meeting with airline executives convened at the White House to discuss the effect of the outbreak on their industry. He appeared to be referring to a regulation that limited the ability of laboratories run by states, universities and private companies to conduct medical screenings not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. On Saturday, the F.D.A. commissioner, Stephen M. Hahn, allowed those labs to use tests they independently developed after submitting evidence that they work before the F.D.A. completes its review.\n\nDr. Robert Redfield, the C.D.C. director, said the regulatory change was quickly making tests more available. \"It's really very, very important,\" Dr. Redfield said at the White House event with Mr. Trump. \"It's what's changed the availability of testing overnight.\"\n\nDozens of labs have now applied for emergency approval under the F.D.A. decision.\n\nUnder fire for his handling of the outbreak, Mr. Trump appeared eager to focus attention on the Obama administration, making a point of using the former president's name in his comments to reporters. He did not explain why his administration did not change the rule during his first three years in office or before this past weekend, two months into the outbreak.\n\nMr. Obama did not immediately respond, but he separately posted a message on Twitter urging Americans to follow advice from the C.D.C. \"Protect yourself and your community from coronavirus with common sense precautions: wash your hands, stay home when sick and listen to the @CDCgov and local health authorities,\" he wrote. \"Save the masks for health care workers. Let's stay calm, listen to the experts, and follow the science.\"\n\nMr. Trump, joining a meeting that had been set to be led by Mr. Pence, sought to reassure Americans that the outbreak was under control and portrayed the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of flights to other countries like China as a boon for domestic travel.\n\n\"A lot of people are doing domestic business now,\" the president said. \"They're staying in this country. They feel safe. If you look at the percentage, we have a very small percentage\" of infections.\n\nAsked if he considered it safe to fly, Mr. Trump pointed at the executives around his table: \"Where these people are flying, it's safe to fly.\"\n\nBut the airline executives made clear that they were struggling to persuade passengers of that. \"Right now, the fear is almost worse than the virus,\" Nicholas Calio, the president and chief executive of Airlines for America, the trade association for leading passenger and cargo airlines, told Mr. Trump, gently pressing him to do more to reassure the traveling public.\n\nMr. Trump did not directly offer any additional help. \"Yeah, no, we're doing a good job,\" he responded.\n\nBut the famously germ-phobic president said he was doing his part by following medical advice on how to avoid becoming infected. \"I haven't touched my face in weeks,\" he said. \"In weeks. I miss it.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_baker@nytimes.com", "name": "Peter Baker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlines_for_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airlines for America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/us/politics/04dc-trumpvirus/04dc-trumpvirus-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5573825", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 8194, "pinterest": 12}, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 8206, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1467282460", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-02", "time": "01:30:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-02T01:30:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-02T01:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/nyregion/new-york-coronvirus-confirmed.html", "title": "Coronavirus in N.Y.: First Case Confirmed in New York State", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily Coronavirus newsletter.\n\nGov.

Dr. Fauci explained that antiviral drugs were being studied to see if they might make the illness less severe. The president also said the disease would go away in the spring. Dr. Fauci said maybe so, but because it was caused by a new virus, there was no way to tell.\n\nExperts like Dr. Fauci should be the ones who speak to the public during epidemics, said Representative Donna E. Shalala of Florida, who was his boss during the Obama administration, when she led the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\"I think Tony is playing the same exact role that he has in the past -- to make sure the science is accurate and clear,\" Ms. Shalala said. \"During a health emergency, it's the scientists and physicians that are the credible people to the American public, not politicians.\"\n\n\"I used to make him wear his white coat when talking to the public,\" she added. \"I used to make them all wear their white coats so people were reassured that they are real doctors.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Dr. Fauci appeared on at least two television news shows, warning that as the virus spread -- there were 450 cases in 33 states -- some stricter measures to isolate the infected might be considered. He also offered advice for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions who are most at risk, saying they should avoid cruises and plane flights and large gatherings.\n\nAt a recent Congressional subcommittee hearing, one representative asked Dr. Fauci if he had a twin, because he seemed to be everywhere lately. Another offered medical advice: lemon, honey and bourbon for his voice, which has been hoarse for weeks from endless rounds of talking to lawmakers, scientists, health officials and reporters.\n\nIf Dr. Fauci has become the explainer-in-chief of the coronavirus epidemic, it is in part because other government scientists have left a vacuum, avoiding the news media spotlight or being reined in by the Trump administration and accused of exaggerating the threat from the virus. When reporters call Dr. Fauci, he calls them back.\n\nDr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is famous for being unknown: He has given few interviews or public talks outside those required by administration news conferences. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the C.D.C.'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who warned on Feb. 25 that the coronavirus was likely to spread in the United States, and that \"this could be bad,\" came under fire from the administration and has toned down her advisories.\n\n\"Nancy Messonnier told it like it is,\" said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the former director of the C.D.C. \"And she was 100 percent right, and they silenced the messenger.\"\n\nThe C.D.C. has made few of its other scientists available for interviews about the coronavirus. And it is now facing sharp criticism for long delays in providing states with kits to test for the virus, and for setting such tight limits on the tests performed at its headquarters in Atlanta that some diagnoses were delayed or missed, possibly leaving infected people to spread the virus to others.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nDr. Fauci, 79, does not seem to be in the cross hairs. Although he was recently told he must clear his many TV, radio and print interviews through the White House, he has said that he has not been muzzled.\n\n\"You don't want to go to war with a president,\" Dr. Fauci told Politico. But he thinks the public needs solid, understandable medical information, especially during crises. He makes a point of not trying to \"razzle-dazzle\" audiences with his knowledge, he told an interviewer in 2015, adding that his education at a Jesuit high school and college taught him intellectual rigor and the value of public service. As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, Dr. Fauci has lasted through six presidents, and has declined multiple requests to lead his agency's parent organization, the National Institutes of Health. He has led federal efforts to combat diseases caused by emerging viruses, including H.I.V., SARS, the 2009 swine pandemic, MERS, Ebola and now the new coronavirus.\n\nHe was an architect of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, started in 2003 by President George W. Bush, to fight H.I.V. globally.\n\nIn 2001, after anthrax was mailed to Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Bush administration tried initially to minimize the threat, but Dr. Fauci was characteristically blunt.\n\n\"This is material that is quite formidable, that is infecting people with inhalation anthrax, infecting them in the absence of direct contact,\" he said. \"You can call it whatever you want to call it with regard to grade and size or weaponized or not weaponized. The fact is, it is acting like a highly efficient bioterrorist agent.\"\n\nPrevious disease outbreaks have kept him on the lookout for new pathogens, and in January, reports of unexplained pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, set off alarms in his head.\n\n\"Even before we knew it was a coronavirus, I said it certainly sounds like a coronavirus-SARS type thing,\" he said. \"As soon as it was identified, I called a meeting of top-level people and said, 'Let's start working on a vaccine right now.'\"\n\nHe is among the most highly paid federal employees, earning about $400,000 a year, more than the vice president or the chief justice of the Supreme Court. He oversees a 2020 budget of $4.75 billion, which is $769 million less than last year's after being cut by the Trump administration.\n\nUnflappable though Dr. Fauci may seem, the new coronavirus worries him, especially its spread in the Seattle area and the toll it is taking in a nursing home there. He said he thought it was still possible to stop the disease, but health authorities would have to know where it was to do that, and he said the lack of testing capacity was a huge obstacle.\n\nTest kits sent by the C.D.C. to states were flawed, and it has taken weeks to begin replacing them. And strict regulations from the Food and Drug Administration hampered outside labs' efforts to begin to do their own tests.\n\nBut Dr. Fauci declined to join the chorus of blame against the C.D.C.\n\n\"It's so easy to play Monday morning quarterback,\" he said. \"Every element of the federal government was working full-speed to try to get this out and get things going.\"\n\n\"What I really want to concentrate on is the idea of getting enough tests out there to get an evidence-based foundation of where we are in this country,\" he said. \"Seattle is of concern. We need to know the extent of the community spread.\"\n\nAt times in the past, Dr. Frieden said, Dr. Fauci may have over-promised a bit in his enthusiasm for projects of his that have yet to pan out -- an H.I.V. vaccine, and a universal flu vaccine that would provide long-lasting immunity to multiple strains so that people would not need another shot every year.\n\n\"It's the role you have to play to get money from the Hill, and the role of a researcher to be eternally optimistic about a cure being around the corner,\" Dr. Frieden said. \"He's very effective at asking for money from Congress.\"\n\nHe is also a fair-minded colleague, Dr. Frieden added. During West Africa's Ebola epidemic in 2014, after two nurses treating a patient who had traveled to the United States became infected, the C.D.C. was harshly criticized for not having helped hospitals to prepare better. Dr. Fauci did not pile on.\n\n\"Not everything we did was perfect,\" said Dr. Frieden, who then headed the C.D.C. \"There are many people in similar roles as Tony who might have taken advantage of that for the interest of their institution, and Tony was always honorable.\"\n\n\"If we did something wrong he was frank about that,\" he continued. \"When we were getting attacked unfairly, he defended us. That's very unusual behavior in the bureaucratic situation you see in Washington sometimes. I think that's why Tony is so respected.\"\n\nDuring the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the U.S. government and its health agencies were a frequent target of criticism and protests, blamed for inaction on potential treatments and inadequate funding for research and medical care.\n\nWhen AIDS activists demonstrated outside his institute in 1988, demanding a chance to try experimental drugs, Dr. Fauci surprised the leaders by inviting them into his office. He wound up working with them to develop new ways to expand access without compromising the clinical trials that were urgently needed to determine which drugs worked -- an approach that was later applied to research in other diseases as well.\n\n\"There are a lot of world class scientists, but Tony has a special set of skills,\" Ms. Shalala said. \"An ability to communicate, high integrity and an understanding of politics -- and to know to stay out of politics in order to protect scientists.\"\n\nDr. Fauci acknowledged that his age puts him in one of the groups at highest risk for becoming severely ill from a coronavirus infection. But it has not slowed him down. He sleeps only about five hours a night, works most of his waking hours and jumps on the Metro to get around the Washington, D.C., area, from his office to the Capitol and the White House. Most days, he runs or power walks 3.5 miles.\n\n\"I'm not worried about myself,\" he said. \"I'm worried about the job I have to do.\"\n\nAndrew Jacobs contributed reporting.

Salman and an uncle of the crown prince. He was for a time the great hope of family members and other critics who hoped he might try to block Prince Mohammed's ascension to the throne, but he had shown no signs of seeking to do that.\n\nThe former crown prince who was arrested, Mohammed bin Nayef, is also the former interior minister and a longtime favorite of Washington.\n\nHe had already effectively been under house arrest since he was removed from those roles by the current crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in 2017. It was unclear why he was detained.\n\nHis younger brother, Prince Nawaf bin Nayed, was also detained.\n\nThe detentions come at a touchy moment for the kingdom and the royal family.\n\nThe apparently unilateral decision of Crown Prince Mohammed to halt visits to Mecca in response to the coronavirus -- a move with few if any precedents in Islamic history -- has stirred grumbling. His plans to modernize the Saudi economy have shown little progress so far.

The nursing home described a continuing crisis even as a strike team from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including doctors and nurses, arrived on site to help the facility.\n\nThe home had received 45 virus testing kits as of Saturday afternoon, Mr. Killian said, which was not enough for the 63 residents still inside Life Care and dozens of staff members who have continued working at the facility through the outbreak.\n\n\"We cannot make any promises that further exposure in the facility is not happening,\" Mr. Killian said.\n\nSix residents still living inside the facility, where visitors have been restricted from entering, have developed symptoms, he said. And 70 of the facility's 180 workers have also developed symptoms but are no longer coming to work.\n\nLeaders including Vice President Mike Pence and Dow Constantine, the King County executive, have vowed to bring extraordinary government resources to help the facility in recent days, as illnesses and deaths were reported. The center has been associated at least 44 cases of coronavirus and the deaths of the 13 residents as well as one visitor -- accounting for most of the deaths from the virus in the United States.\n\nFederal and state guidance over who may be tested for the virus has expanded in recent days, though much uncertainty remains about who will be tested. Washington State's health department has said that there are no restrictions on who can get tested but it also has said that not everyone needs it. Officials from the state's health department and the federal Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately return messages seeking comment Saturday.\n\nOfficials identified the coronavirus outbreak at the facility a week ago, though testing has since revealed that a patient who went to the hospital earlier was also infected, Mr. Killian said.\n\n\"Within our population, we have seen some results that have frankly concerned us with how quickly symptoms have shown, become acute and led to even death,\" Mr. Killian said.\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, Mr. Pence visited Washington State and vowed to bring the full resources of the federal government to help, noting, in particular, that he would work to make sure that the Kirkland nursing home and other facilities for older adults around the country were safe.\n\nMr. Constantine has said that the county, too, would provide extensive support, including looking for ways to get equipment so that residents could be moved out of Life Care into family homes if possible.\n\nAlong with the test kits, resources in the region have been limited in other ways. Nurses have expressed concern about the availability of protective equipment. On Saturday, blood banks in the Seattle area were strained. The banks rely on donors to supply hospitals, but local leaders have urged people to telecommute and for other groups, like people 60 and older, to stay at home.\n\nCurt Bailey, who leads the nonprofit Bloodworks Northwest, said the coronavirus outbreak has led to a confluence of factors unlike anything the organization has ever seen: Businesses, telling employees to work from home, have canceled blood drives; seniors, among the most frequent donors, have been staying home; some people are avoiding group gatherings.\n\n\"It has the potential to become extremely dangerous,\" Mr. Bailey said. He encouraged the public to visit donation centers.\n\nMr. Bailey said the nonprofit has tried to keep an overall blood supply that could last about four days, but he worries that the continuing trends could lead to a shortage for a facility that supplies some 90 hospitals in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nA national network could help support the supplies in the Northwest, Mr. Bailey said, but as coronavirus spreads, he worries that those other banks will face their own resource strains.\n\nWhile blood is vital to those needing surgery and those fighting cancer, Mr. Bailey said coronavirus patients themselves who end up in critical care may also need blood support.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

deaths are reported.In the province where the virus emerged, the only new cases are in Wuhan.The epidemic grows at an alarming rate in Europe.China says its exports tumbled as the outbreak took hold.South by Southwest leads a long list of canceled events.Everyone on the Grand Princess cruise ship will be tested, after 21 tested positive.How to quarantine yourself. (Don't even pet the dog.)U.S. cases pass 300, and the first East Coast deaths are reported.\n\nAuthorities across the United States reported 307 cases of coronavirus and 17 deaths as of Friday, with Florida reporting the first deaths on the East Coast. The number of infections does not count the 21 people who have tested positive aboard a cruise ship off California.\n\nFlorida officials on Friday night said there had been two deaths in the state related to the coronavirus. Both of the people who died had traveled internationally, they said.\n\nHawaii reported its first confirmed infection, a person who had been on the cruise ship, the Grand Princess.\n\nThe West Coast has borne the brunt of the toll in the United States. Washington State has recorded the most coronavirus cases, more than 80, and the highest number of deaths, 14. Most of the fatal cases emerged from a Seattle-area nursing home. Officials in King County, Wash., said 15 residents of the facility, Life Care Center, had been taken to hospitals over the past 24 hours.\n\nTwo residents of other Seattle-area complexes that largely serve elderly people have now also been hospitalized and tested positive, officials said, identifying them as Issaquah Nursing & Rehabilitation Center and Ida Culver House Ravenna.\n\nTracking Every Coronavirus Case in the U.S.: Full Map\n\nMaps show the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and the number of cases and deaths by state.\n\nIn the province where the virus emerged, the only new cases are in Wuhan.\n\nHubei, the Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, reported on Saturday that for two consecutive days, the province had seen no new infections outside its capital, Wuhan. The news confirmed that China's new cases and deaths are increasingly concentrated in that city, where the virus emerged, while the rest of the province -- and the rest of the country -- are largely spared.\n\nHubei reported 74 new infections on Saturday, all in Wuhan. China also recorded 24 cases in people who had arrived from abroad, including 17 in Gansu, a northwest Chinese province. Excluding the infections in Wuhan and among arrivals from abroad, there was only one other new infection in the rest of China.\n\nChina also reported 28 deaths among those with the virus, all in Hubei Province. By comparison, there were 49 deaths from the virus in Italy on Friday.\n\nThe downward trend in China is a result of an all-out effort by the government to contain the spread of the disease, which has come at a great cost to the country's economy and its social life. Since January, the government has enacted nationwide quarantine and travel restrictions and placed Hubei under a strict lockdown, effectively penning in 56 million people.\n\nThe new numbers reflect a steep decline from just a few weeks earlier. At one point in early February, Hubei reported more than 1,400 new cases outside Wuhan in one day.\n\nOne of the government-appointed Chinese researchers working to control the outbreak told the state-run newspaper People's Daily on Thursday that, based on the data, he expected Wuhan to hit zero new infections later this month.\n\nThe epidemic grows at an alarming rate in Europe.\n\nThe number of infections climbed past 7,300 in Europe on Friday -- more than doubling in just three days.\n\nFrance, Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and others each recorded their biggest one-day increases in cases. More than 30 European countries now have cases; 10 of them have at least 100 each.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nA member of the French Parliament tested positive for the virus. Doctors in Britain warned that the already-strained health care system there could be overwhelmed as the outbreak grows, and the country had its second coronavirus death.\n\nIn Italy, with the worst outbreak outside of Asia, the toll rose on Friday to more than 4,600 cases, 197 of them fatal, increases of almost 800 infections and 49 deaths from the day before. Only China has had more people die from the new coronavirus.\n\nPope Francis has had a cold for over a week, and on Thursday, a Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, said that the pontiff's illness was \"running its due course.\"\n\nHe also told reporters that the Vatican was \"studying measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19,\" the disease caused by the new coronavirus, that could affect coming activities involving the pope.\n\nGermany, France and Spain, with the next-largest outbreaks in Europe, reported more than 1,700 cases combined, up from fewer than 1,200 on Thursday. In Switzerland, the confirmed caseload doubled, to more than 200.\n\nOutside Europe, in Iran's outbreak, one of the world's largest, the government reported more than 4,700 infections, an increase of more than 1,200 from the day before.\n\nEdouard Philippe, the French prime minister, announced a 15-day school closure in two regions, Oise and Haut-Rhin.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 102,000 people in at least 83 countries.\n\nChina says its exports tumbled as the outbreak took hold.\n\nChina's trade has suffered as the epidemic crippled factory production, paralyzed much of the country's trucking industry and created temporary backlogs at ports.\n\nExports from China, the world's largest manufacturer and its second largest economy, tumbled 17.2 percent in the first two months of this year compared to the same period last year, according to data released Saturday morning by the General Administration of Customs. Imports fell 4 percent.\n\nChina's imports of meat, soybeans, medicines and medical equipment offset declines in imports of semiconductors, as the country's electronics factories shut down for weeks.\n\nThe timing of Lunar New Year celebrations affected the data, making it hard to compare either January or February separately to the same months last year. The weeklong holiday fell in late January this year and was in early February last year.\n\nCompanies try every year to export and import as much as possible before the holiday. Such shipments in early January, when the Chinese authorities were still concealing the spread of the disease, may have dampened the steepness of this year's drop.\n\nThe decline reflected two problems: fewer goods were being produced, and what was being made could not be transported. Gao Gao, a deputy secretary general of the Chinese government's National Development and Reform Commission, said at a news briefing on Friday morning that 80 percent of China's logistics companies had told the government that they had been severely affected.\n\nBy the end of February, only 70 percent of the industry's trucks and other vehicles were operating, partly because many drivers are stranded far from their employers by quarantines and other obstacles, Mr. Gao said. China is trying to address the problem by ordering that once drivers complete a 14-day quarantine upon their return from their hometowns at the end of holidays, they do not have to undergo additional quarantines in cities that they visit while driving cargo.\n\nSouth by Southwest leads a long list of canceled events.\n\nThe 34th annual edition of South by Southwest, the annual festival of music, film and technology in Austin, Tex., that has become a global draw, was ordered canceled on Friday by local officials over fears about the spread of coronavirus.\n\nFestival organizers and government officials had come under intense pressure in recent days to pull the plug, with more than 50,000 people signing an online petition and a growing list of tech companies -- among them Apple, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok -- announcing their withdrawal.\n\nThe festival was to have run from March 13-22, with events spread across bars and party spaces in Austin, in addition to the main conference activities.\n\nThe cancellation is perhaps the largest collateral damage of the virus so far on the international cultural calendar. Last year, South by Southwest's various events had a combined attendance of 417,000, including 159,000 who came to the music portion, according to festival figures.\n\nTwo other large-scale, multiday gatherings were also called off or pushed back on Friday: Emerald City Comic Con, a convention that draws thousands of people to Seattle each year, was postponed until the summer; and the Ultra Music Festival, an electronic dance music event held annually in Miami, where city officials blocked the event from going on.\n\nEveryone on the Grand Princess cruise ship will be tested, after 21 tested positive.\n\nAll of the 3,533 people aboard a cruise ship idling off San Francisco will be tested for the coronavirus, after 19 crew members and two passengers tested positive, Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday.\n\nThe ship, the Grand Princess, had been halted off the coast on Wednesday, until passengers with possible coronavirus symptoms or exposure could be tested. On Thursday, a Coast Guard helicopter flew testing kits to the ship and flew samples for 46 people back to shore.\n\n\"Twenty-one of those on the ship tested positive for the coronavirus, 24 tested negative and one test was inconclusive,\" Mr. Pence said at a White House news briefing -- blindsiding the passengers and the ship's operators.\n\n\"We have developed a plan which will be implemented this weekend to bring the ship into a noncommercial port,\" he added. \"All passengers and crew will be tested for the coronavirus. Those that need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those that require additional medical attention will receive it.\"\n\nMr. Pence said the Defense Department was working to locate a California military base where passengers on the ship could be tested. Two air bases in the state have been used to house quarantined Americans repatriated from Asia.\n\nShortly after Mr. Pence's briefing, the ship captain came over the loudspeaker and apologized that passengers were getting updates from television news rather than him. The captain said that he had not received any advance notice about the news briefing and that the ship would notify individuals of their test results \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe Princess cruise line said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials had told the doctor on board of the results as Mr. Pence was speaking.\n\nPresident Trump, speaking at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said he would have preferred not to let the passengers disembark onto American soil. \"I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault,\" he said. \"And it wasn't the fault of the people on the ship either. Okay? It wasn't their fault either. And they are mostly Americans.\"\n\nHe added that, after all, he had authorized federal health officials to make the decision.\n\nHow to quarantine yourself. (Don't even pet the dog.)\n\nIf you're returning from an area that's had a coronavirus outbreak, or if you've been in close contact with someone who tests positive, you may be asked to isolate yourself at home for two weeks, the presumed incubation period for the coronavirus.\n\nIt's not easy to lock yourself away from your family and friends. These are the basics.\n\nIsolation If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your elderly aunt and even your pets. If you don't have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it's absolutely essential. Don't take the bus, subway or even a taxi.\n\nMasks If you must be around other people -- in your home, or in a car, because you're on your way to see a doctor (and only after you've called first) -- wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.\n\nHygiene Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven't just washed them.\n\nDisinfecting Don't share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.\n\nHousehold members When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you're touching anything that might carry the patient's bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The elderly members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.\n\nReporting was contributed by Eliza Shapiro, Katie Rogers, Roni Caryn Rabin, Keith

You bet. Here's how.", "body": "When a video of Naomi Campbell cleaning her airplane seat and wearing a mask and gloves was shared online last year, it made the rounds because her behavior seemed exaggerated. (\"Clean everything you touch,\" Campbell said in the video.)\n\nMajor airlines, including Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, say they clean their planes to varying degrees between flights, and that plane cleanliness is a priority. But some travelers, including apparently Campbell, prefer the comfort of knowing they've also taken measures of their own to sanitize their airplane space.\n\nThere's been increased attention on this in recent weeks, with the unsettling spread of the coronavirus around the world.\n\n\"The airplane and airplane seat is a public space, and we know that germs can live on surfaces for a long time, so it doesn't hurt to clean it,\" said Aaron Milstone, associate hospital epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nHere are some tips for cleaning your area of a plane and keeping healthy on a flight.\n\nKeep your hands clean and stop touching your face\n\n\"Wiping down surfaces on a plane won't hurt, as long as it doesn't give you a false sense of security,\" Andrew Mehle, associate professor of medical microbiology and immunology at the University of Wisconsin Madison, said, stressing that sanitizing your space on a plane should be done in conjunction with washing hands and following other best practices.\n\nViral particles, the transmission vehicle of the coronavirus, must travel within mucus or saliva, and they must enter through eyes, nose or mouth. While the coronavirus can last on surfaces like tray tables, touch screens, door handles and faucets -- one study found that other coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS stay on metal, glass and plastic for up to nine days -- a disinfectant on a hard surface, or soap while washing your hands, will kill the virus.\n\nHowever, most people tend to touch their faces more often than they realize. Doing so after touching a surface where droplets from when someone sneezed or coughed can lead to the virus being passed on.\n\nSo first things first: Wash your hands.\n\n\"It's just as important to think about where your hands have been and to wash your hands,\" said Mehle.\n\nWash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or long enough to sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice, and if that's not possible, then use a generous amount of hand sanitizer.\n\nChoose a window seat\n\nA study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window. Researchers studied passengers and crew members on 10 three- to five-hour flights and observed that people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.\n\n\"Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,\" said Vicki Stover Hertzberg, a professor of biostatistics and bioinformatics at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University and one of the lead researchers on the study. \"Be vigilant about your hand hygiene.\"\n\nDisinfect hard surfaces\n\nWhen you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seat-belt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.\n\n\"It's not bad to wipe down the area around you, but it's worth remembering that the coronavirus is not going to jump off the seat and get into your mouth,\" Milstone said. \"People should be more careful of touching something dirty then putting their hands on their faces.\"\n\nDisinfecting wipes typically say on the packaging how long a surface needs to stay wet in order for them to work. That time can range from 30 seconds to a few minutes. In order for the wipes to work, you need to follow those time requirements.\n\nHertzberg added that if there's a touch-screen television, you should use a tissue when touching the screen. Using a paper towel or tissue ensures that there's a barrier between a surface that might have droplets and your hands, which will likely make their way to your face.\n\n\"Someone who has been sick and coughing might have touched the door and the faucet, so use wipes in the bathroom, then use paper towels to open the door and to close the faucet, then throw those in the trash on the way out,\" said Bernard Camins, the medical director for infection prevention at the Mount Sinai Health System.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html", "title": "Miscommunication, Confusion and Fear Mar White House Response to Coronavirus", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- After weeks of conflicting signals from the Trump administration about the coronavirus, the government's top health officials decided late last month that when President Trump returned from a trip to India, they would tell him they had to be more blunt about the dangers of the outbreak.\n\nIf he approved, they would level with the public.\n\nBut Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, got a day ahead of the plan. At noon on Feb. 25, just as Mr. Trump was boarding Air Force One in New Delhi for his flight home, she told reporters on a conference call that life in the United States was about to change.\n\n\"The disruption to everyday life might be severe,\" she said. Schools might have to close, conferences could be canceled, businesses might make employees work from home. She had told her own children, she said, to prepare for \"significant disruption to our lives.\"\n\nThe stock market plummeted, cable news blared apocalyptic headlines and by the time Mr. Trump landed at Joint Base Andrews early the next morning, his critics were accusing him of sowing confusion on an issue of life or death.\n\nThe president immediately got on the phone with Alex M. Azar II, his secretary of health and human services. That call scared people, he shouted, referring to Ms. Messonnier's warnings. Are we at the point that we will have to start closing schools? the president added, alarmed, according to an official who heard about the call.\n\nTo health officials, the message needed to change with the outbreak. \"The epicenter was shifting\" as the number of cases outside China surpassed those inside, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the C.D.C. \"The issue of what this might mean to us became more important.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, the Trump administration's attempts to forestall an outbreak of a virus now spreading rapidly across the globe was marked by a raging internal debate about how far to go in telling Americans the truth. Even as the government's scientists and leading health experts raised the alarm early and pushed for aggressive action, they faced resistance and doubt at the White House -- especially from the president -- about spooking financial markets and inciting panic.\n\n\"It's going to all work out,\" Mr. Trump said as recently as Thursday night. \"Everybody has to be calm. It's going to work out.\"\n\nHealth experts say that telling people to remain calm is an effective message in an epidemic, and it is appropriate that it come from the president. Clear, honest communication is also crucial, and the United States has at times criticized China and other governments for being less than transparent.\n\nBut from Mr. Trump's first comments on the virus in January to rambling remarks at the C.D.C. on Friday, health experts say the administration has struggled to strike an effective balance between encouraging calm, providing key information and leading an assertive response. The confused signals from the Trump administration, they say, left Americans unprepared for a public health crisis and delayed their understanding of a virus that has reached at least 28 states, infected more than 300 people and killed at least 17.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nA Very Big Deal\n\nMr. Azar was at his home in Bethesda, Md., on Friday, Jan. 3, when Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C.'s director, called to tell him China had potentially discovered a new coronavirus. Mr. Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive who helped manage the response to earlier SARS and anthrax outbreaks, told his chief of staff to make sure that the National Security Council was aware.\n\nThis is a very big deal, Mr. Azar told him.\n\nThe Trump administration had eliminated the global health unit that had been part of the National Security Council, but within days, a team was meeting daily in the basement of the West Wing, pleading with Chinese officials to allow doctors from the C.D.C. into their country.\n\nFor weeks, the Chinese refused offers of public health cooperation. \"China nice-talked it for a month,\" said Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, a top official at the Department of Homeland Security who was working on the coronavirus effort. \"'Oh, well, thank you for the offer. Blah, blah.'\"\n\nOn Saturday, Jan. 18, a day after the C.D.C. dispatched 100 people to three American airports to screen travelers coming from Wuhan, China, Mr. Azar made his first call to Mr. Trump about the virus, dialing him directly at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate. The president insisted on talking about e-cigarettes first, but Mr. Azar steered him to the virus.\n\nFour days later, during a two-day trip to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, the president chose to focus on the positive.\n\n\"We have it under control,\" he said. \"It's going to be just fine.\"\n\nOn the evening of Jan. 28, a new kind of crisis broke out in the skies.\n\nThe State Department had ordered the evacuation of the American Consulate in Wuhan and a 747 was in the air. But as it headed for the United States with hundreds of passengers who possibly carried the virus, administration officials in Washington were in a frantic scramble about where it should land.\n\nDr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response, tried to secure some kind of military base in California, but was struggling to cut through Pentagon red tape. In a panic, his staff started booking hundreds of rooms at three hotels in the Los Angeles area, asking for full floors so they could separate potentially infected evacuees from other guests.\n\nOne idea was to land the plane at the Ontario airport outside Los Angeles, and officials went so far as to schedule, then cancel, a briefing for some members of the California congressional delegation. After hours of wrangling, and with the plane still in the air, Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, said the plane could land at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, which had space to house all of the passengers.\n\nInside the White House, a debate broke out, centered on concerns that had become ever-present since the virus first emerged: How would the government's actions be perceived by the public? And what would the president think?\n\nAt issue was whether to impose a federal quarantine order on the evacuees to prevent them from leaving for 14 days. Such authority had not been used since a smallpox outbreak in 1969. But officials had to find some way to make sure the passengers did not leave the base until it was clear they were not infected.\n\nMr. Azar pushed for the order but others were wary, concerned it could cause panic. They decided to ask the passengers to voluntarily stay at the military base. One woman balked, so California officials, who use quarantine authority more often, stepped in and forced the passengers to stay.\n\nTime to Provoke China?\n\nBy the end of January, the virus was veering out of control in China, the source of 23,000 visitors to the United States each day. Any one of them could be the trigger for a new and undetected American outbreak.\n\nOver four days in the White House Situation Room, the nation's top public health and national security officials engaged in a fierce debate over whether to take the extraordinary step of banning travel from China.\n\nPublic health officials were initially wary. Experts have long recommended against restricting travel during outbreaks, arguing that it is often ineffective and can stymie the response by limiting the movements of doctors and other health professionals trying to contain the disease. A ban would anger China, they worried, ending any hope of cooperation with American medical teams.\n\nOfficials at the National Security Council and Department of Homeland Security argued that China had already proved unwilling to cooperate. A third group inside the White House was worried that the move would incite panic and could roil the financial markets.\n\nBy Thursday, Jan. 30, the public health officials had come around. Mr. Azar, Dr. Redfield and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed that a ban on travel from the epidemic's center could buy some time to put into place prevention and testing measures. \"There was so much we didn't know about this virus,\" Dr. Redfield said in an interview. \"We were rapidly understanding it was much more transmissible, that it had a great ability to go global.\"\n\nThe debate moved that afternoon to the Oval Office, where Mr. Azar and others urged the president to approve the ban. \"The situation has changed radically,\" Mr. Azar told Mr. Trump.\n\nOthers in the room urged being more cautious, arguing that a ban could have unforeseen consequences. \"This is unprecedented,\" warned Kellyanne Conway, the president's counselor. Mr. Trump was skeptical, though he would later claim that everyone around him had been against the idea. The two countries were in delicate trade negotiations. Was this the time to provoke China? he asked. And what about the consequences on the economy?\n\nThe president sided with his more aggressive aides, and announced the ban next day.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump was publicly upbeat about the effects of the virus. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire in early February, as the World Health Organization was announcing new cases by the tens of thousands, he said of the coronavirus, \"By April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.\"\n\nIn fact, the fight against the virus was already beginning to stumble.\n\nA system used to track travelers returning from China went offline just as state officials were told to begin monitoring them. Mr. Azar said at a congressional hearing that he needed at least 300 million respirator masks for health care workers, but the national emergency stockpile, the government's reserve of disaster supplies, held only 12 million, and many of those had expired.\n\nAnd a C.D.C. coronavirus test distributed to state labs had a flawed component that led to sometimes inconclusive results, crippling the nation's testing capacity for weeks, a problem the administration is still struggling to solve despite repeated promises from Mr. Trump and his aides.\n\nAmericans stranded in Japan on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, were finally returned home Feb. 17, but the president became enraged when he learned that 14 of the passengers had tested positive for the virus in the process of being transferred to government planes.\n\nHe later said that he was worried that bringing back people who tested positive for the virus would increase the public tally of people infected in the United States.\n\nThe month ended with a whistle-blower's claim that workers from the Department of Health and Human Services had been sent to greet returning Americans from China at two military bases in California without the personal protective gear that is required for anyone coming into contact with potentially exposed patients. None of the workers tested positive for the virus, but the allegation shook Congress.\n\n'I Like the Numbers Being Where They Are.'\n\nThe president's motorcade pulled onto the main C.D.C. campus in Atlanta just before 4:30 p.m. on Friday, passing protesters holding signs that said \"Have faith in science\" and \"We need a vaccine against Trump.\"\n\nTen weeks after the virus first emerged in China, the total number of confirmed cases in the world surged past 100,000 and public health experts warned darkly that the outbreak was far from over. The United States, they said, faces weeks, if not months, of uncertainty and continued disruptions in education, businesses, commerce, medicine, government and daily life.\n\n\"Time matters,\" Dr. Redfield said in an interview on Friday.\n\nLast week, Vice President Mike Pence was given control of the public messaging, and although Mr. Pence has had some mixed messages of his own -- he promised more tests before they were available -- the White House has since displayed more discipline. Mr. Pence holds twice daily conference calls with officials from across the country, and a virus task force he leads issues daily talking points, with comment from the health professionals, to make sure the message is consistent.\n\nBut the president still has his bullhorn. During his visit to the C.D.C., Mr. Trump told reporters that he was not inclined to let 21 people who tested positive for the virus on a cruise ship off the coast of California onto American soil.\n\n\"They would like to have the people come off,\" he said. \"I would like to have the people stay.\" The president said he would allow health experts to make the final decision, but he made clear again where he stood.\n\nHis concern? It would increase the tally for the number of people infected in the United States. \"Because I like the numbers being where they are,\" the president said.\n\nMichael D.

crisis.\n\n\"Who would have thought?\" he asked during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nerve center for the government's response to the outbreak. \"Who would have thought we would even be having the subject?\"\n\nActually, quite a few people would have thought, and did -- including the officials in his own White House who were in charge of preparing for just such a pandemic only to have their office shut down in a reorganization in 2018. \"The threat of pandemic flu is the No. 1 health security concern,\" one of the officials said the day before that happened two years ago. \"Are we ready to respond? I fear the answer is no.\"\n\nFor a president who lives in the moment, rarely planning too far ahead, the coronavirus has proved to be a leadership challenge he was not prepared for either. The outbreak that has rattled the nation does not respond to Mr. Trump's favorite instruments of power: It cannot be cowed by Twitter posts, it cannot be shot down by drones, it cannot be overcome by party solidarity, it cannot be overpowered by campaign rally chants.\n\nMr. Trump, who is at his strongest politically when he has a human enemy to attack, has seemed less certain of how to take on an invisible killer. The role of calming natural leader is not one that has come easily as he struggles to find the balance between public reassurance and Panglossian dismissiveness. He has predicted that the virus will \"miraculously\" disappear on its own with warmer weather, suggested a vaccine will be available soon and insisted anyone who wants to be tested can be -- all overstated or inaccurate.\n\nHe has expressed an astonishing lack of knowledge while at the same time claiming to be a medical savant. He has treated the crisis as a partisan battle, wearing his red Keep America Great campaign cap to the C.D.C. and calling the governor presiding over the state with the highest death toll a \"snake.\" He even admitted that he wanted to leave passengers stranded on a cruise ship rather than see statistics for the number of cases on American soil go up because it would look bad.\n\n\"If we really want to talk about what is going to potentially create panic in this country, it's an administration that's just not being straight with the American public about the extent of this epidemic and the real-life consequences that could be put upon Americans,\" Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nDr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a prominent cardiologist who performed a heart transplant on former Vice President Dick Cheney and later wrote a book with him, said he was convinced that the Trump administration failed to move more quickly to test for the virus after it emerged in China because the White House did not want to admit the scope of the threat.\n\n\"When the story is finally written,\" he said on Sunday, \"we'll come to understand that tens of thousands of lives were placed at risk because of a political decision made by the president.\"\n\nMr. Trump, who was spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, rejected the criticism on Sunday, pointing to the travel restrictions he imposed early on China, later adding limits or warnings to other affected places like Iran and parts of South Korea and Italy.\n\n\"We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus,\" he wrote on Twitter moments after arriving at his golf club in West Palm Beach on a warm day made for duffing. \"We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!\"\n\nAfter initially brushing off warnings by his health secretary as \"alarmist,\" Mr. Trump in the last two weeks has taken a more assertive public role on the coronavirus, assigning Vice President Mike Pence to lead the government efforts and making multiple appearances to signal that he takes the threat seriously.\n\nBut he has also taken a business-as-usual approach to the rest of his schedule, refusing to cancel campaign rallies, fund-raisers or social events even as other large gatherings of Americans are scrubbed. Asked by a reporter on Saturday night if he was worried that infections were getting closer to the White House, Mr. Trump said, \"No, I'm not concerned at all.\"\n\nThe president then went inside Mar-a-Lago to host a lavish birthday party for the former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Donald Trump Jr. and turns 51 on Monday, a preview perhaps of the celebration that may be held next month when Melania Trump turns 50. Among those spotted at the revelry were boldface names from Mr. Trump's circle, including Mr. Pence, Lindsey Graham, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Tucker Carlson and Matt Gaetz.\n\nMr. Trump happily introduced his visitor, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, to Mr. Carlson and other guests in a video shared on social media, boasting that he \"gave him a good gift\" by not imposing tariffs on Brazil and \"that made him much more popular.\" Mr. Bolsonaro laughed and said, \"S\u00ed.\" A smiling Mr. Pence turned to the camera and playfully repeated, \"S\u00ed.\"\n\nThe first lady did not make the trip to Florida, but she faced a fiddling-while-Rome-burns blowback of her own over the weekend after posting online photographs of herself in a hard hat overseeing the privately financed construction of a new tennis pavilion at the White House.\n\n\"I encourage everyone who chooses to be negative & question my work at the @WhiteHouse to take time and contribute something good & productive in their own communities,\" she wrote on Twitter on Saturday, adding her anti-bullying slogan, \"#BeBest.\"\n\nBy the president's own account, the coronavirus has been an education for him. He has acknowledged that \"I didn't know people died from the flu\" -- tens of thousands, in fact, each year in the United States -- even though, as The Washington Post pointed out, his own grandfather died of influenza during the 1918 epidemic.\n\nBut he has credited himself with instinctive understanding of the science. \"I like this stuff. I really get it,\" he said at the C.D.C. on Friday. \"People are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, 'How do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.\"\n\nMr. Trump rejected criticism of the slow distribution of test kits, framing it in terms evoking his battle against impeachment. \"The tests are all perfect,\" he told reporters, \"like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right?\" -- a reference to the rough transcript of his telephone call with Ukraine's president that led to his own impeachment for abuse of power.\n\nThe president's less-than-perfect pronouncements, however, left public health officials straining to reconcile them on the Sunday talk shows. Asked on CNN's \"State of the Union\" about a White House aide's assertion that the coronavirus had been \"contained,\" Dr. Jerome M. Adams, the surgeon general, said: \"Well, this is a novel virus. It's a new situation. And the messaging, quite frankly, is hard.\"\n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also appeared to walk back the president's claim that \"anyone who wants a test can get a test,\" saying on \"Fox News Sunday\" that it would actually be up to a doctor.\n\nMr. Trump has become such a polarizing figure that even when he is not necessarily wrong, many do not trust him. On Sean Hannity's Fox News show last week, he called the World Health Organization's estimated fatality rate of 3.4 percent \"a false number,\" saying \"my hunch\" was that it would be under 1 percent. It sounded as if he were substituting his uneducated \"hunch\" for the judgment of professionals.\n\nBut in fact, he was reflecting what he had been told by health experts, including Dr. Fauci and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C. director, who have concluded that once the full scope of unreported infections is known, the number of deaths will most likely represent a smaller share, possibly \"considerably less than\" 1 percent. The W.H.O. has also said the rate may fall.\n\nStill, at his appearance at the C.D.C., Mr. Trump had no explanation for why his White House shut down the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense established at the National Security Council in 2016 by President Barack Obama after the 2014 Ebola outbreak, stammering to suggest the coronavirus had been a surprise.\n\n\"Well, I just don't think -- I just don't think that somebody is going to -- without seeing something, like we saw something happening in China,\" Mr. Trump said. \"As soon as they saw that happening, they essentially -- not from the White House. I mean, you know, we don't need a lab in the White House. But they saw something happening.\"\n\nElizabeth Cameron set up the global health security directorate at the White House for Mr. Obama before turning it over to Rear Adm. R. Timothy Ziemer, who ran it for Mr. Trump until May 2018, when he was pushed out and the directorate folded into other parts of the National Security Council. Had it still been around, it would have been charged with preparing for exactly the situation now facing the country.\n\n\"I think it would have made a difference,\" Ms. Cameron said on Sunday. \"Monitoring and preparing for every eventuality and having a person and a directorate accountable for that is really important and could have been important in this case.\"\n\nChris Cameron

Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nBOSTON -- When an employee of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire showed signs of possible coronavirus last week, a medical worker who had examined him told him to avoid contact with others, pending further tests. Instead, he went to a mixer at a crowded music venue.\n\nThree days later, he was confirmed as the state's first coronavirus case.\n\nAnd now a second case has been confirmed -- a \"close contact\" of the patient's -- raising new questions about what should happen when suspected coronavirus patients ignore requests to self-quarantine.\n\nThe man, who had come down with flu-like symptoms after a trip to Italy, has now been officially ordered by New Hampshire's health commissioner to isolate himself at home.\n\n\"The individual is complying now,\" said Jake Leon, communications director for the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nNews that a health care worker could have exposed students at the event last Friday night, a mixer for doctors and Dartmouth College students, swiftly reverberated on the nearby campus.\n\nStudents learned of a possible exposure in an email sent out by the university on Tuesday, which revealed that a man who later tested positive for coronavirus had attended the mixer held for students at the college's Tuck School of Business on Feb. 28. The event occurred on the same day that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had issued a new Italy travel advisory, warning all those who had recently been to the country to stay home and monitor their health for 14 days.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nAcross the country, thousands of travelers returning from places with substantial outbreaks of the virus have been asked to stay home and avoid contact with others for 14 days, a request that largely relies on the honor system. As the virus spreads, many worry that the recommendations are not always followed.\n\nIn the New Hampshire case, the man went to the doctor on Friday with a fever and respiratory symptoms and was tested for a range of possible ailments, health authorities said. Doctors advised him to quarantine himself, but did not test him for coronavirus until Monday. He arrived at the social event hours after the warning on Friday.\n\nDartmouth College officials, in a message to students, said an investigation was underway to trace the close contacts of the individual, and said no Dartmouth students were considered close contacts to the patient at this time. It was unclear whether the second patient who tested positive had attended the mixer or was exposed at another time.\n\n\"The general vibe is we are all pretty concerned that this medical professional showed up to the event, despite being told to self-isolate,\" said Christie Harrison, a first-year Tuck student who sang with the band that performed at the mixer on Friday night. She estimated that about a hundred business school students attended, along with 30 or 40 resident physicians associated with Dartmouth-Hitchcock, an academic medical center located near Dartmouth College.\n\n\"We all were just excited to have one of the last few parties of the quarter and be off campus,\" Ms. Harrison said. She said investigators appear to have made efforts to trace those who interacted with the man at the mixer, and have asked them to self-quarantine. Those who did not interact with him, like herself, were simply told to monitor their health and alert authorities if they came down with symptoms, she said.\n\n\"The college was really great at communicating all of that to us, in a timely manner,\" Ms. Harrison said. \"The college has been really transparent with us throughout the process.\"\n\nGunnar Esiason, a Tuck student who considered going to the mixer on Friday night, but did not, said he nonetheless felt distressed about the potential exposures because he has underlying health issues. \"In my opinion, it is shocking that a health care worker would do this, if it is in fact true,\" said Mr. Esiason. He has since left campus and was planning to take exams remotely.\n\nThe mixer was hosted at the Engine Room, a music and comedy venue in White River Junction, just across the border in Vermont. According to a message on the club's Facebook page, owners received a call from Dr. Benjamin Chan, an epidemiologist with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, informing them that an individual who tested positive for coronavirus had attended the event on Friday night. Vermont health authorities had also been in touch.\n\nThe management said it was in the process of professionally cleaning the facility and had canceled at least three events that were to be held there this week.\n\nAngry patrons wrote back on Facebook that the coronavirus patient should be jailed or fined.\n\nBut it appears that the patient was under no legal obligation to stay home at the time. Under New Hampshire law, a person who refuses to comply with a formal isolation order issued by the health commissioner is guilty of a misdemeanor. In other states, refusing to comply is a felony. But on Friday, the patient had not been diagnosed, and had merely been advised by a health care worker to stay home. The formal isolation order was issued after the mixer, after the patient was tested on Monday and the results were determined \"presumed positive,\" state authorities said.\n\nNew Hampshire officials have made clear in their public statements that they feel the patient acted irresponsibly. But he does not appear to have broken the law.\n\n\"You can't bring criminal charges for being a bonehead or just not doing what you were told was advisable to do,\" said Wendy Parmet, faculty director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern University. \"It's not illegal to ignore the advice of your health care provider, or even the health department, until officials follow the particular procedures to issue a formal health order, and those procedures vary by state.\"\n\nThere is a downside to punishing a single individual in such a case, she said.\n\n\"We certainly don't want people to think that they shouldn't get tested because if they do, they'll open themselves up to criminal liability, or a policeman at the door enforcing quarantine,\" she said. \"Those are consequences that deter testing, treatment and compliance.\"\n\nThe second New Hampshire patient who tested positive for coronavirus, also a man from Grafton County, is also under isolation at home.",

Sneezes? Sex? How the Coronavirus Can and Cannot Spread", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nA delicate but highly contagious virus, roughly one-900th the width of a human hair, is spreading from person to person around the world. The coronavirus, as it's known, has already infected people in at least 60 countries.\n\nBecause this virus is so new, experts' understanding of how it spreads is limited. They can, however, offer some guidance about how it does -- and does not -- seem to be transmitted.\n\nIf I cross paths with a sick person, will I get sick too?\n\nYou walk into a crowded grocery store. A shopper has coronavirus. What puts you most at risk of getting infected by that person?\n\nExperts agree they have a great deal to learn, but four factors likely play some role: how close you get; how long you are near the person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much you touch your face. (Of course, your age and health are also major factors.)\n\nWhat's a viral droplet?\n\nIt is a droplet containing viral particles. A virus is a tiny codependent microbe that attaches to a cell, takes over, makes more of itself and moves on to its next host. This is its \"lifestyle,\" said Gary Whittaker, a professor of virology at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nA \"naked\" virus can't go anywhere unless it's hitching a ride with a droplet of mucus or saliva, said Kin-on Kwok, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care.\n\nThese mucus and saliva droplets are ejected from the mouth or nose as we cough, sneeze, laugh, sing, breathe and talk. If they don't hit something along the way, they typically land on the floor or ground.\n\nTo get access to your cells, the viral droplets must enter through the eyes, nose or mouth. Some experts believe that sneezing and coughing are likely the primary forms of transmission. Professor Kwok said talking face-to-face or sharing a meal with someone could pose a risk.\n\nJulian Tang, a virologist and professor at the University of Leicester in England who is researching coronavirus with Professor Kwok, agreed.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\n\"If you can smell what someone had for lunch -- garlic, curry, etc. -- you are inhaling what they are breathing out, including any virus in their breath,\" he said.\n\nHow close is too close?\n\nChristian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said it's best to stay three feet from a sick person.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that standing within six feet could carry risk.\n\nHow long is too long to be near an infected person?\n\nIt's not yet clear, but most experts agree that more time equals more risk.\n\nWill you know a person is sick?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nKeep in mind that if you do get sick, most symptoms are as mild as a cold or the flu. Still, others who are infected with coronavirus never fall ill at all. (Technically, COVID-19 is the name for the sickness caused by the respiratory virus.)\n\nBut the flip side of this is that it can be hard to tell who is capable of spreading coronavirus.\n\nIn a growing number of cases, people without symptoms have infected others. The W.H.O. still believes that most of those who have spread coronavirus were clearly ill at the time of transmission, Mr. Lindmeier said.\n\nCan the virus last on a bus pole, touch screen or other surface?\n\nYes. After numerous people who attended a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong fell ill, the city's Center for Health Protection collected samples from the site. Restroom faucets and the cloth covers over Buddhist texts tested positive for coronavirus, the agency said.\n\nTechnically, the virus widely known as the coronavirus is just the latest of many similarly shaped viruses. (Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, which resemble a crown or the sun's corona.) A study of other coronaviruses found they remained on metal, glass and plastic for two hours to nine days.\n\nWhether a surface looks dirty or clean is irrelevant. If an infected person sneezed and a droplet landed on a surface, a person who then touches that surface could pick it up. How much is required to infect a person is unclear.\n\nREAD: How to disinfect your space on an airplane.\n\nCoronaviruses are relatively easy to destroy, Professor Whittaker said. Using a simple disinfectant on a surface is nearly guaranteed to break the delicate envelope that surrounds the tiny microbe, rendering it harmless.\n\nAs long as you wash your hands before touching your face, you should be OK, because viral droplets don't pass through skin.\n\nIf you are concerned about getting sick from someone who might have sneezed onto a product you've ordered that's made in China, don't worry. In the time it takes to get to the United States, you should be safe, and if you are really concerned, you can clean the surface with a disinfectant or wash your hands after touching it.\n\nDoes the brand or type of soap you use matter?\n\nNo, several experts said.\n\nMy neighbor is coughing. Should I be worried?\n\nThere is no evidence that viral particles can go through walls or glass, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.\n\nHe said he was more concerned about common spaces than dangers posed by vents, provided there is good air circulation in a room.\n\nAn infected neighbor might sneeze on a railing and if you touched it, \"that would be a more natural way to get it from your neighbor,\" he said.\n\nCan I get it from making out with someone?\n\nKissing could definitely spread it, several experts said.\n\nThough coronaviruses are not typically sexually transmitted, it's too soon to know, the W.H.O. said.\n\nIs it safe to eat where people are sick with coronavirus?\n\nIf a sick person handles the food or it's a high-traffic buffet, then risks cannot be ruled out -- but heating or reheating food should kill the virus, Professor Whittaker said.\n\nDr. Jha concurred.\n\n\"As a general rule, we haven't seen that food is a mechanism for spreading,\" he said.\n\nCan my dog or cat safely join me in quarantine?\n\nThousands of people have already begun various types of quarantines. Some have been mandated by health officials, and others are voluntary and primarily involve staying home.\n\nCan a cat or dog join someone to make quarantine less lonely?\n\nProfessor Whittaker, who has studied the spread of coronaviruses in animals and humans, said he's seen no evidence that a person could be a danger to their pet.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

expands testing for people who fear they have been infected.Death toll in the U.S. rises to nine after two earlier deaths in Washington State are tied to the virus.Production disrupted, India curbs the export of key drugs. Facebook gives global health officials free advertising to combat misinformation. As Chinese hospitals focus on the coronavirus, other patients are ignored. N.B.A.'s African league postpones start of its inaugural season. U.S. expands testing for people who fear they have been infected.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would lift all restrictions on testing for the coronavirus, and would release new guidelines to fast-track testing for people who fear they have the virus, even if they are displaying mild symptoms.\n\nThe guidelines \"make it clear that any American can be tested, no restrictions, subject to doctor's orders,\" Mr. Pence told reporters at the White House. The federal government had promised to ramp up testing after drawing criticism for strictly limiting the tests in the first weeks of the outbreak.\n\n\"The estimates we're getting from industry right now -- by the end of this week, close to a million tests will be able to be performed,\" the head of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Stephen Hahn, said at a White House briefing on Monday.\n\nSome companies and public health officials cast doubt on the government's assurances, saying in some cases that tests under development are still weeks from approval.\n\nAnd even if a million test kits were available, public health laboratories say they would not be able to process nearly that many within a week. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that public health labs can test 15,000 people daily, though that figure is expected to grow.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 93,100 people in at least 76 countries.\n\nDeath toll in the U.S. rises to nine after two earlier deaths in Washington State are tied to the virus.\n\nTwo people who died last week in the Seattle area were infected with coronavirus, officials said on Tuesday, suggesting that the virus had spread in that region days earlier than health officials had previously known.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nThat brought the death toll in Washington State, and in the United States, to nine. So far, those deaths have all been in the Seattle area.\n\nThe confirmation of additional deaths adds to an escalating emergency in a region that has rapidly emerged as a focal point for the virus in the United States, where there have now been at least 120 cases of coronavirus in more than a dozen states, as local health authorities from coast to coast raced to assess the risk to schools, medical centers and businesses.\n\nThe other deaths, all announced over the last few days, included residents of a nursing care facility in Kirkland, a Seattle suburb.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Amazon emailed its staff in the Seattle area saying it learned that an employee in one of its many office buildings in the South Lake Union neighborhood tested positive for the virus. \"The employee went home feeling unwell on Tuesday, February 25 and has not entered Amazon offices since that time,\" the email said.\n\nHealth officials in North Carolina announced that state's first case of coronavirus on Tuesday afternoon. They said the patient there had traveled to Washington and been \"exposed at a long-term care facility\" where there was an outbreak, an apparent reference to the Life Care nursing center in Kirkland, Wash.\n\nThe North Carolina patient was said to be doing well and isolated at home in Wake County.\n\nProduction disrupted, India curbs the export of key drugs.\n\nThe spreading coronavirus may soon affect people's health in a different way: The outbreak is starting to hurt the supply of essential drugs.\n\nDrug makers are struggling to get raw ingredients for common antibiotics and vitamins from Chinese factories, which were closed for weeks as China battled to contain the coronavirus. Now, even as some of China's factories have restarted, shortages of some drugs may develop.\n\nThe disruption is being felt most acutely in India, where the authorities on Tuesday ordered the country's vast pharmaceutical industry to stop exporting 26 drugs and drug ingredients, most of them antibiotics, without government permission.\n\nThat's a problem for the rest of the world, which relies on India's drug makers for much of its supply of generic drugs. India exported about $19 billion of drugs last year and accounted for about one-fifth of the world's exports of generics by volume, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation.\n\nFacebook gives global health officials free advertising to combat misinformation.\n\nFacebook said on Tuesday it was taking measures to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by partnering with the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and governments around the world.\n\nThe social network said it had been working with different groups over the past month to use its ample resources for global aid during the outbreak by offering insight into the behavior of the 2.9 billion people who use its products, or the ability to spread correct information about how to deal with and prevent the virus.\n\n\"We're focused on making sure everyone can access credible and accurate information,\" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in a post to his Facebook page. \"This is critical in any emergency, but it's especially important when there are precautions you can take to reduce the risk of infection.\"\n\nIf someone now searches for the coronavirus on Facebook, they will see a pop-up on the site directing them to the W.H.O. website or a local health authority for the most up-to-date information. The company is also handing out free advertising to global health agencies -- including unlimited free advertising for the W.H.O. -- to spread information on how to combat the virus.\n\nFacebook has played a role in the spread of misinformation around the coronavirus since the outbreak began. Some people have posted ads claiming false cures and other bogus information to turn a profit. Conspiracy theorists have used the company's platforms -- including Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp -- to spread misleading information around how the disease is spread. Facebook said it was doing what it could to identify and limit such activity.\n\nAs Chinese hospitals focus on the coronavirus, other patients are ignored.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak is straining China's already overburdened health care system, and many patients with other illnesses are now falling through the cracks.\n\nIn Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak, many hospitals have been converted into facilities for treating only patients with the coronavirus. Elsewhere, other facilities have closed amid shortages of medical workers or rejected patients because of fears of cross-infection in the wards.\n\nElective surgeries have been postponed indefinitely. Many cities have imposed travel restrictions and quarantine requirements that, for many critically ill patients, mean delays they cannot afford.\n\nWith the daily tally of new coronavirus infections now on the decline, Chinese officials have begun to tout the country's efforts to combat the epidemic as a victory.\n\nBut the outbreak is straining a health care system that was overburdened even before the coronavirus surfaced, and many patients with other illnesses are now falling through the cracks. The concern is the country's containment efforts may be saving some lives at the expense of others.\n\nChen Xi, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Yale School of Public Health, said he thought it was likely that preventable deaths from strokes, heart attacks and other acute diseases could outnumber the lives saved from treating coronavirus patients.\n\nN.B.A.'s African league postpones start of its inaugural season.\n\nJoining many other sports organizations altering schedules in response to the spread of the coronavirus, the Basketball Africa League -- the professional association in Africa that is backed by the N.B.A. -- announced on Tuesday that it was postponing the start of its inaugural season. The league, which consists of 12 teams across Africa, was set to begin play on March 13 in Dakar, Senegal.\n\n\"Following the recommendation of the Senegalese government regarding the escalating health concerns related to the coronavirus, the B.A.L.'s inaugural season will be postponed,\" Amadou Gallo Fall, the league's president, said in a statement. \"I am disappointed we are not able to tip off this historic league as scheduled but look forward to the highly anticipated launch of the B.A.L. at a later date.\"\n\nAs the N.B.A. continues trying to expand around the globe, the B.A.L. is viewed as a pipeline for future talent.\n\nReporting was contributed by Amy Qin, Sui-Lee Wee, Katie Rogers, Christina Goldbaum, Vindu Goel, Reed Abelson, Sopan Deb, Mike Isaac, Karen Weisse, and Sarah

"Opinion | 'I Love the World But I Cannot Stay'", "body": "Generally, I don't think about death during the day. My schedule is full and I focus on what is right before my eyes. It's usually only when I go to funerals that I reflect upon deaths past, present and future; most of the time I think about life. Still, about once a month I wake in the night and know with absolute clarity that I will soon be gone.\n\nI have always felt my own finitude. My father had his first stroke at 45 and died at 54. My mother died of diabetes at 74. I am 72. I would like to attend my last grandchild's high school graduation and meet at least one great-grandchild. However, with my family history, that is unlikely. Now, with the news filled with stories of the coronavirus, I am reminded of the many random diseases that can strike suddenly and lethally.\n\nLike almost all my peers, I want to die young as late as possible. I don't want to live beyond my energy level. I don't want to suffer dementia or lie helpless in a hospital. I want to die while I still believe that others love me and that I am useful.\n\nI have done what I can to prepare for my death. I have a will, a health care proxy and medical directives. I've had many conversations with my family and my doctor about end-of-life decisions. My mnemonic device for all of them is, \"If in doubt, snuff me out.\"\n\nWhile death is inevitable, our attitudes about it are not. We can be sanguine or gloomy, solicitous of others or self-absorbed. We can approach our deaths with fear and resistance or with curiosity and a sense of mission.\n\nFacing death offers us an opportunity to work with everything we have within us and everything we know about the world. If we have been resilient most of our lives, most likely we will cope well with our own dying. It is frightening, of course, but it is our last chance to be a role model, even a hero.\n\nI'd like to face death with the courage of my grandmother. The last time I visited her she was recently widowed and dying from leukemia. She lay in bed in her small home in eastern Colorado. I could see she was in pain and could barely move, but when I asked about her health, she replied: \"Let's talk about you. How is college going this year?\"\n\nWhen I complimented her on her courage, she said simply, \"I am going to be in pain and die soon no matter how I behave, so I might as well be cheerful.\"\n\nBy the time we are in our 70s, we are likely to have witnessed many people dying. I've seen my parents and my husband's parents die \"bad deaths\" with months of suffering and too much medical intervention, and I've witnessed peaceful deaths in rooms filled with love. Most of us boomers know how to behave at a bedside and have a sense of how we want to act when it's our turn to be the one in bed.\n\nWe also have had decades of observing the rituals of death -- hospitals and hospice, funerals, burials and the communal meals afterward. From these experiences, we have learned what we do and don't want when it's our turn. We may continue some of these traditions, but we will also design our own. Some of my friends with terminal illnesses have hosted goodbye parties in parks or at our local blues bar. Wakes with dancing, music and storytelling are back in style. Many of us want pine box coffins, green burials or cremations with our ashes tossed in beautiful places.\n\nWhat happens after death is a popular topic among people I know. Opinions range from, \"We turn into dirt,\" to \"I will see the face of God.\" My writer friends want heaven to have a good library. One friend believes we will return to the place we were before we were born.\n\nJean Nordhaus wrote, \"The dead are all around us / feathering the air with their wings.\" A therapist who lost her young, cello-playing husband told me she feels his presence and knows they are still deeply connected in spirit. She finds that many people are afraid to die because they have no language for the numinous, however she is certain that neither life nor relationships end with death.\n\nI feel death may not be as big a change as we suppose. Rather, it might be like crossing a river.\n\nI like to think that my relatives and friends will be waiting for me on the other side. I like to imagine grassy banks and flower-filled pastures shining in the sun. I like to think a lot of things, but I don't know for sure.\n\nI am not a particularly mystical person, but I have had mystifying experiences. When my Aunt Grace died, I drove to the Ozarks for her funeral. Her little house was surrounded by pink surprise lilies -- what my cousins called \"naked ladies.\" The next spring, even though I had not planted them and they had never come up before, surprise lilies popped up in my garden. The year after that they popped up again but in different places. I concluded that Aunt Grace was greeting me. If I wanted to send a message after death, I would do it with flowers, too.\n\nI love the world but I cannot stay. Death is democratic and we will all participate in its enactment. I will miss the beauty all around me. I have taken so much pleasure in the natural world, in people, and in books, music and art, in cups of coffee and lolling cats. If I knew that I had a month left to live, I wouldn't spend my time much differently than I do now.\n\nAll of my life I have loved snow.\n\nWhen I was a girl in the 1950s, snow fell often in the long winters of western Nebraska. I remember one winter when, after the streets were plowed, mountains of snow 10 feet tall stood in the middle of the streets. As a young mother, my favorite days were snow days when our family could stay home and play board games. I would make soup and popcorn. I relished taking my children outside to do the things that I had done in the snow as a girl. I loved falling asleep with my family safe on a blizzardy night when the streets were impassable and a blanket of peace covered our town.\n\nNow, snow has become a profoundly spiritual experience. When it snows, I sit by my window and watch it fall. I go deep into its purity and softness.\n\nSnow falls inside and outside of me. It settles my brain and calms my body.\n\nI hope death feels like watching the snow grow thicker and thicker. Doctors call dying of a morphine overdose being \"snowed.\" I would not mind this at all. I would like to disappear in a whiteout.\n\nMary Pipher is a clinical psychologist in Lincoln, Neb., and the author of \"Women Rowing North: Navigating Life's Currents and Flourishing as We Age.\"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

"title": "First U.S. College to Close Classrooms as Virus Spreads. More Could Follow.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nSEATTLE -- The University of Washington said on Friday that it would cancel in-person classes and have students take courses and finals remotely while the Seattle area grapples with a growing coronavirus outbreak, in a move that other colleges around the country are preparing to follow if the virus becomes more widespread.\n\nOver the last few days, a growing number of universities have mobilized emergency planning teams to envision what a shutdown would look like, especially if students bring the virus back with them from spring break, which starts Friday on many campuses.\n\nAlready, some students have been warned that they should be prepared to learn online, as many students studying abroad in Europe and Asia have been forced to do.\n\nThe level of concern rose on Thursday with the announcement that a junior at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee who had been studying in Italy had tested positive for the virus after his study abroad program was canceled and he returned to his hometown, Chicago. The University of California, Los Angeles, also said three of its students were being tested and self-isolating off campus.\n\n\"I'm like on the run from the virus,\" said Zara Khan, a junior at the University of California, Berkeley, who left a study abroad program in Florence for London five days ago. \"I could go back to the States,\" she said on Friday, \"but that's not even safe anymore.\"\n\nThe University of Washington, with 50,000 students on three campuses across the Seattle region, was apparently the first college in the United States to make the shift to online classes amid virus concerns. It said the change would begin Monday and continue through the remainder of the winter quarter, which ends March 20. The university's president, Ana Mari Cauce, said she was hopeful that normal classes would resume during the spring quarter.\n\nThe announcement was the most sweeping decision yet for leaders in the Seattle area rushing to contain the spread of coronavirus, which has been linked to 13 deaths and 75 infections in the state -- all but one announced over the past week.\n\n\"Our goal is to complete this academic quarter with as little disruption to our students and their educational progress as possible,\" Ms. Cauce said.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nOther universities have warned their students to be prepared for similar actions if they become necessary. Duke University sent a campuswide alert on Thursday laying out extensive guidance for students leaving for spring break, advising them to avoid unnecessary travel and stay away from events or venues with a lot of people.\n\nThe note said the school was bracing for the possibility that on-campus classes would have to end if a student or teacher got infected, and students could be forced to finish the semester remotely. \"We hope this will not be necessary but want to be prepared,\" Duke said.\n\nConcern that classes could be canceled after spring break is rampant on many campuses, with shutdown rumors spread from student to student by text message and reinforced by professors who have been told by administrators to start thinking about putting their classes online.\n\nAn email sent by the dean of Yale College on March 3 caught the attention of some students when it said, \"And if you will be traveling home for spring break, consider bringing any items you will want with you if your return to campus is delayed.\"\n\nWhen some students began to interpret that as a warning that the school could close, Yale officials denied any plans to close and warned against spreading panic.\n\n\"In making any decisions about new actions we might take in response to Covid-19, such as the implementation of social distancing or a full or partial closure, Yale leadership will rely on guidance from federal, state and local authorities, and from our own faculty and staff experts,\" said Karen Peart, a Yale spokeswoman.\n\nBut students and professors said it was hard not to think that spring break could be a turning point.\n\n\"Spring break is actually what's making the timing of the spread especially alarming, because everyone's leaving,\" said Kahlil Greene, Yale's undergraduate student body president. \"Everyone's dispersing and then everyone's coming back together. In many people's minds, that makes it more likely that something is going to happen on campus.\"\n\nSome colleges are encouraging students not to travel. Schools like Duke, New York University and the University of Chicago are asking students and faculty to register their travel plans, even locally, on a web-based form developed for emergencies like earthquakes and terrorist attacks. And many universities have canceled school-sponsored spring break trips abroad.\n\nThe University of Chicago, Fordham and others sent email messages to families in recent weeks saying they would support students who wanted to remain in the dorms over spring break, to avoid the risks of traveling. The University of Pennsylvania is adding extra dining hours for students who want to stay.\n\nMany universities are also discouraging trips to China, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan, where the infection is more severe, and asking students and faculty members to isolate themselves for two weeks if they return from those countries.\n\nSyracuse University said on Friday that it was watching travel warnings from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention closely, and would re-evaluate whether to continue study abroad programs in places like the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Chile.\n\nAlexandra Lupo, a junior at Fordham, had been in Italy for about two months studying in Florence, a popular destination for study abroad students interested in art and culture, when she learned that her program was being shut down.\n\nCoronavirus was spreading, administrators said in a surprise meeting. Everyone should leave the city by March 1.\n\nInstead of giving up and going back home to New Jersey, Ms. Lupo decided she would fly off to London with a friend she had met in the program. Over spring break, she and her friend will be traveling to Amsterdam and Dublin.\n\n\"I'm lucky I was still able to do that with everything that was going on,\" Ms. Lupo said.\n\nNot every student studying abroad was so fortunate. Several N.Y.U. students bound for Shanghai saw their program canceled after coronavirus swept through China, so some transferred to Florence -- until it was shut down.\n\nSince returning from Italy to her home in Weston, Conn., Molly Morris, a student at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., has been following her doctor's advice to stay away from other people and monitor her temperature. She is not allowed to go to the grocery store or exercise class.\n\nAfter her isolation period, at the end of next week's spring break, she plans to go to New York City for her mother's birthday, to visit some museums and restaurants.\n\nSome students are hoping to salvage at least the minimum accomplishment of getting credit for their courses through online learning. But students and instructors alike describe the remote courses as improvisational and primitive.\n\n\"It's a bit of a disaster,\" said Marilynn Johnson, a history professor at Boston College whose study abroad program in Venice was shut down. \"I feel like I'm teaching out to the void.\"\n\nBut it may be good preparation for what is to come.\n\n\"Everybody's making contingency plans back in the U.S. over spring break,\" Dr. Johnson said. \"I think people are anticipating that the same thing may happen in the U.S. that's happening in Europe. They're suddenly going to come back and find out that there's a ban on large gatherings, and that the universities have suspended in-person classes.\"\n\nHer colleagues, she said, are posting \"tips and tricks\" for online teaching in a shared Google Doc.\n\nOne professor in Florence, who was teaching an Italian language immersion class until his students left, has been going around the city filming scenes and using them for his online lessons. \"He's a funny man, so it's funny, but it's sad we're not there,\" said Ayden Mallory, an N.Y.U. student who returned from Florence. But she is finding it hard to motivate herself to study Italian when she is in \"cold, cold Boston.\"\n\nShe thinks about how this whole episode will seem when she looks back on it some day. \"I feel sometimes sad, sometimes angry, sometimes laughing,\" she said. \"But it also feels monumental as well.\"\n\nMike Baker reported from Seattle and Anemona Hartocollis from New York.

"Coronavirus: How to stop touching your face. (It's important.)", "body": "Now that we know that it's bad to touch our faces, how do we break a habit that most of us didn't know we had?\n\nThroughout the day, we touch a lot of surfaces -- doorknobs, elevator buttons, subway poles -- where viruses, including the new coronavirus, can linger for days. From there, microbes can piggyback on our fingertips to our noses, mouths or eyes, all of which are entry portals for the coronavirus, as well as other viruses and germs.\n\nIt took the coronavirus outbreak to make many of us aware of just how often we reach for our faces.\n\n\"It's a very difficult habit to break because we all do it, and oftentimes we're not even aware we're doing it,\" said Dr. Vanessa Raabe, assistant professor in the department of medicine at NYU Langone Health.\n\nWhen you feel the urge to scratch an itch, rub your nose or adjust your glasses, grab a tissue and use that instead of your fingers.\n\nIf you feel you have to sneeze, but don't have a tissue handy, aim your sneeze into your elbow rather than your hand, health experts say. Sneezing into your hand makes it more likely that you will pass your germs on to other people or objects around you.\n\nIdentify triggers.\n\nRaabe of NYU Langone Health offered this suggestion: \"Be cognizant of triggers.\"\n\nPause throughout the day to notice compulsive behavior. Once you're more aware of when and why you're touching your face, addressing the root cause can be an effective solution. If you find yourself rubbing your eyes because they are dry, use moisturizing drops. If you are using your hand as a chin rest or to adjust your hair, be aware of that, Raabe said.\n\nRelated: Coronavirus: Here's what to do (and not do) as the virus looms\n\nDr. Justin Ko, a clinical associate professor of dermatology at Stanford Health, said he tells patients who wear contact lenses to consider wearing glasses instead to discourage them from rubbing their eyes. \"Similarly,\" he said, \"while masks are not very effective for preventing virus transmission, they can be quite helpful for providing a physical barrier against touching the nose or mouth.\"\n\nPutting Post-it notes around the house, or on your desktop, could also serve as helpful reminders.\n\nKeep your hands busy.\n\nKeeping your hands occupied with a stress ball or other object can reduce instances of touching your face and minimize triggers, doctors said. Of course, don't forget to regularly clean and sanitize that object. If you don't have a stress ball to squeeze, mail to sort or laundry to fold, you could lace your hands together in your lap or find another way to actively engage them so you are not bringing them to your face as much.\n\nUsing scented soap or lotion could also help, said Zach Sikora, a clinical psychologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. When you bring your hands close to your face, that smell could make you more aware of your actions.\n\nWe know it's hard. President Donald Trump has struggled with it, too. \"I haven't touched my face in weeks! Been weeks,\" Trump said Wednesday at a meeting of airline chief executives. \"I miss it.\"\n\nChill.\n\n\"My general advice would be that people should try to reduce their stress overall, as opposed to obsessively worrying about what they touch,\" said Stew Shankman, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University. \"Stress impacts your immune system, and the more you're stressed, the more you're reducing your body's ability to fight off infections.\"\n\nHe said he worried about the effects of using ritualistic behaviors, like snapping a rubber band on your wrist each time you touch your face. It is more effective, he said, to try to be in the present moment, practicing meditation and mindfulness exercises and focusing on your breathing.\n\nAs long as your hands are clean, touching your face isn't catastrophic. \"It's a natural behavior we all do,\" Shankman said. \"It's not the end of the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

"As Coronavirus Spreads South in Italy, Top Official in Rome Tests Positive", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nROME -- The coronavirus outbreak that has paralyzed and disrupted economic and social life in Italy spread to the top of Italian politics on Saturday as the leader of the governing coalition's Democratic Party announced he had contracted the virus.\n\n\"Well, it's arrived,\" Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of the Democratic Party, said in a Facebook video posted Saturday that was confirmed as legitimate by a spokesman. \"I also have the coronavirus.\"\n\nThe infection of Mr. Zingaretti represented a new stage in Italy's outbreak, the largest in Europe and the most deadly outside China and which had been concentrated in the country's wealthy and industrious north.\n\nAfter the government's decision last week to close all of Italy's school, the infection of Mr. Zingaretti, who is based in Rome, where he is also the president of the region of Lazio, provided vivid proof that the virus was no longer a matter of northern exposure, and that the entire country was now grappling with a public health emergency.\n\nMr. Zingaretti, the head of the country's largest center-left party and one of the two parties leading Italy, has daily contact with the highest echelon of the political class in the capital, as well as his party's rank and file members and the many Italians he has met on the campaign trail in the course of Italy's regional elections.\n\nAlready some members of Italy's Parliament who come from the locked down areas in the Lombardy region have been quarantined to try to slow the spread of the virus, but the infection of a highly prominent figure like Mr. Zingaretti raised the prospect that more of Italy's political class had been exposed.\n\n\"Certainly a politician meets and hugs many people,\" said Giovanni Rezza, director of the infective illness department at the National Health Institute. \"There is a risk of diffusion.\"\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nElected officials privately expressed concern that the country's Parliament, with many representatives from the infected north, could be a new theater of contagion.\n\nIn Italy, the toll rose on Friday to more than 4,600 cases, 197 of them fatal, with increases of almost 800 infections and 49 deaths from the day before. Only China has had more people die after contracting the new coronavirus.\n\n\"I have always said no panic, we will combat this,\" said Mr. Zingaretti, who has a reputation for understatement. Wearing a sweater and looking relaxed, he added that he hoped to give a \"good example\" to Italians by following \"to the letter\" the advice of the doctors and scientists. He concluded that he would continue to fight for the country, but \"from home.\"\n\nLast week, the president of the Lombardy region, where most of the country's infections have occurred, posted a Facebook video in which he put a mask on after learning one of his close collaborators had contracted the virus. Political opponents criticized the video as dramatic and unnecessarily raising alarm.\n\nMr. Zingaretti sought to convey a calmer demeanor.\n\n\"I'm well, and so it was decided home isolation,\" Mr. Zingaretti said, adding that he would separate himself, and that his family would follow all the advised precautions, as stipulated by Italian protocols for infected people. Italian health officials, he said, had already begun contacting people with whom he worked closely.\n\nMr. Zingaretti has held meetings at the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome, which has been treating coronavirus cases. He also went there to show support to the Lazio region's coronavirus task force, according to Luigi Telesca, a spokesman for Mr. Zingaretti, who said aides to the party leader believed he had contracted the virus there.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Mr. Zingaretti had a slight fever and felt a burning sensation in his eyes, Mr. Telesca said.\n\nAfter his symptoms were reported to health authorities, they ordered a coronavirus test for Mr. Zingaretti and the result was positive.\n\nThe vast majority of those who died in Italy after contracting the virus were elderly and many had serious underlying conditions and were destabilized by the virus, according to health experts. Italy, which has won of the world's most aged populations, has already suffered enormously from the virus, with economic production slowed or outright halted in the northern regions that serve as the country's economic engine.\n\nMilan, the most vibrant city in the country, has become ghostly. The service sector has been hit hard, with hotels closing entire floors for lack of business, restaurateurs looking sadly over empty tables and taxi drivers waiting in long lines for fares that do not come.\n\nLast week the government announced a huge support package of $7.5 billion euros, or about $8.5 billion, in addition to \u20ac900 million announced last week for families and business damaged by the virus.\n\nChurches have had to cancel mass. Schools are closed everywhere, prompting anxiety about child care, especially among working class parents who do not have the ability to work from home. Parents who do stay at home have found themselves struggling to teach division and grammar lessons.\n\nBut the virus has clearly now gained access to the more exclusive halls of power in Rome.\n\nThe Vatican on Friday confirmed its first case of the virus and shut some offices and closed its health clinic for sterilization. A Vatican official was put into a protective quarantine after a priest in Rome tested positive for the virus.\n\nPope Francis, 83, who lost part of a lung from a respiratory illness in his youth, has been suffering from a cold, though the Vatican has said he has no other illnesses. They have declined to say whether he has been tested for the virus.\n\nAccording to the guidelines by the Italian government, Francis should limit visitors and stay home. On Friday, Francis expressed his \"closeness to those who are ill\" with the virus and to health care workers.\n\nOn Saturday, the Vatican announced that the papal events in St. Peter's Square that are typically open to the public, including the pope's Sunday blessing and the Wednesday general audience, will instead be live streamed from the library of the Vatican's apostolic palace \"to avoid the risk of spreading\" the virus, a Vatican statement said.\n\nAfter Mr. Zingaretti announced his illness, expressions of solidarity, a rare element in Italy's bitter and divisive politics, came from across the political spectrum.\n\n\"My hope for a speedy recovery,\" Matteo Salvini, the leader of the nationalist League party, who has criticized the government's response to the crisis and sought to cause the coalition's collapse, said on Twitter. \"It's not normal to do polemics when health is in question.\"\n\nElisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

viruses in the lab or treating sick people in the hospital. He's a mathematician at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and he uses math to understand outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, SARS, influenza and now Covid-19. His goal is to design better ways to control outbreaks.\n\nIn an eerie coincidence, he wrote a book called \"The Rules of Contagion,\" before the current outbreak, which has been published in Britain and will be released in September in the United States. In it he talks about the math of contagion involving not only physical diseases, but also ideas, rumors and even financial crises.\n\nIn a recent experiment for the 100th anniversary of the 1918 flu, he worked with another mathematician and BBC presenter, Hannah Fry, of University College London, to create a documentary, \"Contagion: The BBC Four Pandemic,\" using a phone app to track social contacts and map how an infection might spread.\n\nThe news of coronavirus epidemics around the world involve a flood of numbers that are a challenge for any nonscientist to digest. I asked Dr. Kucharski to help us navigate some of these numbers, and to tell us which ones we should pay attention to. We talked on the phone and corresponded by email this week. This is an edited version of our back and forth.\n\nWe hear a lot about the percentage of sick people who are dying. Is that the case fatality rate?\n\nThe case fatality rate measures the risk that someone who develops symptoms will eventually die from the infection.\n\nAnd how is that rate calculated?\n\nIdeally, we would monitor a large group of people from the point at which they develop symptoms until they later die or recover, then calculate the proportion of all these cases who had died.\n\nSo can we just look at the total number of deaths and the current number of cases?\n\nThe problem with just dividing the total number of deaths and total number of cases is that it doesn't account for unreported cases or the delay from illness to death. The delay is crucial: If 100 people arrive at hospital with Covid-19 on a given day, and all are currently still alive, it obviously doesn't mean that the fatality rate is 0 percent. We need to wait until we know what happens to them eventually.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nAny deaths will be people who got sick two to three weeks ago, so it's not simply deaths at the moment divided by cases at the moment. Plus some cases might be missed: If you have two deaths from two cases, as happened in Iran last month, that most likely means you've missed a bunch of cases.\n\nWe've seen all sorts of numbers for fatality rates. Does the latest estimate of 3.4 percent globally make sense?\n\nEarly on, people looked at total current cases and deaths, which, as I said, is a flawed calculation, and concluded that the case fatality rate must be 2 percent based on China data. If you run the same calculation on yesterday's totals for China, you get an apparent CFR (case fatality rate) of near 4 percent. People are speculating that something is happening with the virus, where it actually is just this statistical illusion that we've known about from Day 1. I'd say on best available data, when we adjust for unreported cases and the various delays involved, we're probably looking at a fatality risk of probably between maybe 0.5 and 2 percent for people with symptoms.\n\nI had a short Twitter thread explaining this (and predicting the rise) a couple of weeks ago:\n\nWhat about another number we hear about all the time, R, the reproductive number, or how many people a given patient is likely to infect. Why is it important and what goes into calculating it?\n\nAt its simplest, R is the answer to the question: How worried should we be about infection? If R is above one, each case, on average, is giving it to at least one other person. You're going to see growth.\n\nIf it's less than one, then a group of infected people are generating less infection. From a policy-planning point of view, it gives you a very clear objective. For example, in the Ebola response in 2014, it was a really prominent part of the response. The aim was to get R below one.\n\nThat seems very simple and straightforward, but you write that it's more complicated than it seems. In your book you say that to calculate R you've got to know duration, opportunity, transmission probability and susceptibility (the \"DOTS\"). Let's take them one by one. What is duration?\n\nHow long someone is infectious. If someone is infectious twice as long, then that's twice as long that they are around to spread infection.\n\nDo we know what the duration is for this coronavirus?\n\nOn average, we'd probably be looking at a week or two. Of course, if people get hospitalized, then they're not in the community spreading infection in the same way.\n\nThe second component is opportunity. How do you determine that?\n\nThat's a measure of how many people you come into contact with for every day you're infectious. With something like flu, you're not infectious very long but a lot of your interactions could potentially spread it. Whereas with something like HIV, the duration is much longer but the number of sexual partners you have relative to the number of conversations you have is obviously much lower.\n\nAnd transmission probability?\n\nThis is a measure of the chance the infection will get across during an interaction. For example, during a sexual encounter, the virus won't necessarily get across.\n\nFinally there's susceptibility. How do you determine that?\n\nSusceptibility measures the chance the person at the other end of the interaction will pick up the infection and become infectious themselves.\n\nOnce you've got numbers for these four components, what's the equation to come up with R?\n\nIf you multiply them together, you get the reproduction number. So if you scale up or scale down any one of these things, it directly affects the value of R.\n\nHow does this knowledge help public health planning?\n\nGenerally, susceptibility is the easiest one to reduce if we have things like vaccines. If we don't, then we have to think about targeting the other aspects of transmission, such as reducing opportunities through social distancing, or probability of transmission during things like handshakes by encouraging hand washing.\n\nWhat if you're not in public health, but are thinking about your own personal chances and what your behavior should be?\n\nIf you imagine you've got a reproduction number of two, each person's infecting two others, on average. But some situations are more likely to spread infection than others. We've found for things like Covid-19, it's close-knit interactions that seem to be most important.\n\nWhat we need to think about -- and what a lot of our modeling is certainly thinking about -- is not just how much transmission is happening, but where is that transmission happening. If you're going to change your behavior, think how to reduce those risky situations as much as possible.\n\nIf you were the average person, what would you pay attention to -- in terms of the news and the numbers?\n\nOne signal to watch out for is if the first case in an area is a death or a severe case, because that suggests you had a lot of community transmission already. As a back of the envelope calculation, suppose the fatality rate for cases is about 1 percent, which is plausible. If you've got a death, then that person probably became ill about three weeks ago. That means you probably had about 100 cases three weeks ago, in reality. In that subsequent three weeks, that number could well have doubled, then doubled, then doubled again. So you're currently looking at 500 cases, maybe a thousand cases.\n\nI think the other thing that people do need to pay attention to is the risk of severe disease and fatality, particularly in older groups, in the over-70s, over-80s. Over all we're seeing maybe 1 percent of symptomatic cases are fatal across all ages. There's still some uncertainty on that, but what's also important is that 1 percent isn't evenly distributed. In younger groups, we're talking perhaps 0.1 percent, which means that when you get into the older groups, you're potentially talking about 5 percent, 10 percent of cases being fatal.\n\nIn thinking about social behavior and thinking about your interactions, the question should be, \"How do we stop transmission getting into those groups where the impact could be really severe?\"", "source":

"Opinion | Why Biden Is the Change Candidate", "body": "If you want to oust President Trump this fall and then achieve far-reaching changes such as universal health care, who should you vote for?\n\nUntil last week, the answer for many was Bernie Sanders, the champion of a \"political revolution\" that includes Medicare for All. But increasingly there's a sense that in practice the real \"change candidate\" may be Joe Biden -- because he has a better chance of winning the presidency and helping to elect a Democratic Congress -- and that's why he was the big winner on Super Tuesday.\n\nThis was a triumph of pragmatism, an embrace by voters of a candidate they like rather than one they love, and that's why Biden is now apparently the Democratic front-runner.\n\n\"I'm here to report that we are very much alive,\" Biden announced after his Super Tuesday victories. Until South Carolina voters weighed in on Saturday, people were checking his campaign to see if rigor mortis was setting in.\n\nAngry Bernie voters may protest furiously that it was the \"establishment\" that revived Biden to seize a prize that seemed theirs. But that's wrong. Biden's rescuers weren't party elders but a marginalized constituency that is often taken for granted: Southern blacks.\n\nIt was black voters who gave Biden a huge win in South Carolina on Saturday, reviving his fortunes and clarifying his role as the alternative to Sanders. It obviously helped that Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar exited the race and, along with Beto O'Rourke, endorsed Biden in time for Super Tuesday (and Klobuchar may end up Biden's running mate, while Buttigieg could end up in a Biden cabinet). But this wasn't a coronation; it was a groundswell among moderates fearful that a Sanders nomination would be a Republican dream.\n\nWe in the pundit world are awful at predictions, and we should all be humbled by the conventional wisdom of 2016 that Trump was unelectable. Still, Sanders is the single most liberal member of the Senate, according to GovTrack, and old-timers remember what happened to Barry Goldwater on the right and George McGovern on the left. Democratic members of the House -- who presumably know something about their own districts -- say that it would be harder for them to win with Sanders at the top of the ticket.\n\nAt a dinner with a dozen Democratic House members recently, I was struck by how worried some were that a Sanders nomination would cost them any chance of a Democratic Senate and might even hand the House itself back to Republicans.\n\nI'm closer to some of Sanders's positions than to Biden's, and I particularly admire Sanders's leadership and authenticity on human rights issues like Yemen. But I don't think Sanders would be able to accomplish his aims as president any more than he has been able to as a senator (he was a primary sponsor of only seven bills that became law, and they are mostly insignificant items, such as naming post offices or designating \"Vermont Bicentennial Day\").\n\nWhat the Democrats need to stage a revolution, or even a healthy evolution, is to win not only the presidency but also the House and the Senate. Democrats flipped the House in 2018 with moderate candidates running on a practical, limited agenda, while progressives running in swing districts did poorly, and that's a lesson for 2020.\n\nWinning the Senate for Democrats got tougher with Roy Moore's defeat in the Republican primary in Alabama on Tuesday, for Moore would have made it easier for Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, to be re-elected. The betting markets suggest that Republicans have a better chance of winning the House than the Democrats do the Senate.\n\nRepublicans sometimes seemed giddy about the prospect of a Sanders nomination. Trump's tweets suggested that he was terrified of Biden and Mike Bloomberg, and it's no accident that Republicans were calling for investigations into the Biden family rather than into allegations about the Sanders family and Burlington College.\n\nIn Arizona, when Senator Martha McSally tried to discredit her Democratic rival, Mark Kelly, her strategy was to release an ad accusing him of being a \"Bernie Bro.\" Being a \"Biden Bro\" conjures something less frightening.\n\nBiden is plodding and uncharismatic, but he has solid working-class credentials and he's also one of the most decent people in politics. His empathy is hard-won from the pain of the loss of two children. Samantha Power, the former ambassador to the United Nations, says Biden would give out his private cellphone number to strangers who had suffered great personal loss, saying: If you feel low and have no place to turn, call me.\n\nI think the Democrats with Biden have a good chance of winning the presidency, holding the House and perhaps taking the Senate. An economic slowdown seems likely because of the coronavirus, which also highlights Trump's administrative incompetence. And Republican rhetoric about Democrats as socialists -- the theme of CPAC this year was \"America vs. Socialism\" -- is laughable if Biden is on top of the ticket.\n\nSo while Biden's proposals aren't as soaring as Sanders's, nor as comprehensive as I would like, they strike me as more achievable. In that sense, Biden may be the real candidate of change.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
