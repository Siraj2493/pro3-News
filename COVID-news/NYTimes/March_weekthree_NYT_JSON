Cooks who can usually name every spice in a restaurant dish can't smell curry or garlic, and food tastes bland. Others say they can't pick up the sweet scent of shampoo or the foul odor of kitty litter.\n\nAnosmia, the loss of sense of smell, and ageusia, an accompanying diminished sense of taste, have emerged as peculiar telltale signs of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and possible markers of infection.\n\nOn Friday, British ear, nose and throat doctors, citing reports from colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other symptoms, to slow the disease's spread. The published data is limited, but doctors are concerned enough to raise warnings.\n\n\"We really want to raise awareness that this is a sign of infection and that anyone who develops loss of sense of smell should self-isolate,\" Prof. Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, wrote in an email. \"It could contribute to slowing transmission and save lives.\"\n\nShe and Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT UK, a group representing ear, nose and throat doctors in Britain, issued a joint statement urging health care workers to use personal protective equipment when treating any patients who have lost their senses of smell, and advised against performing nonessential sinus endoscopy procedures on anyone, because the virus replicates in the nose and the throat and an exam can prompt coughs or sneezes that expose the doctor to a high level of virus.\n\nTwo ear, nose and throat specialists in Britain who have been infected with the coronavirus are in critical condition, Dr. Hopkins said. Earlier reports from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus first emerged, had warned that ear, nose and throat specialists as well as eye doctors were infected and dying in large numbers, Dr. Hopkins said.\n\nThe British physicians cited reports from other countries indicating that significant numbers of coronavirus patients experienced anosmia, saying that in South Korea, where testing has been widespread, 30 percent of 2,000 patients who tested positive experienced anosmia as their major presenting symptom (these were mild cases).\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Lawmakers' disagreements threaten a sweeping federal economic stabilization package. Governors plead for masks and ventilators, and Trump outlines response. New York State now has roughly 5 percent of the world's cases. See more updates More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nThe American Academy of Otolaryngology on Sunday posted information on its website saying that mounting anecdotal evidence indicates that lost or reduced sense of smell and loss of taste are significant symptoms associated with Covid-19, and that they have been seen in patients who ultimately tested positive with no other symptoms.\n\nThe symptoms, in the absence of allergies or sinusitis, should alert doctors to screen patients for the virus and \"warrant serious consideration for self isolation and testing of these individuals,\" the academy said. The organization has reminded its members that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged all clinicians to prioritize urgent and emergency visits for the next several weeks and to reschedule elective and routine procedures.\n\n\"There is evolving evidence that otolaryngologists are among the highest risk group when performing upper airway surgeries and examinations,\" said a notice posted on the academy's website on Friday. \"A high rate of transmission of Covid-19 to otolaryngologists has been reported from China, Italy and Iran, many resulting in death.\"\n\nDr. Rachel Kaye, an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Rutgers, said colleagues in New Rochelle, N.Y., which has been the center of an outbreak, first alerted her to the smell loss associated with the coronavirus, sharing that patients who had first complained of anosmia later tested positive for the coronavirus. \"This raised a lot of alarms for me personally,\" Dr. Kaye said, because those patients \"won't know to self quarantine.\"\n\n\"Most ENTs have on their own accord tried to scale down,\" she said, adding that her department at Rutgers had already started using personal protective equipment and stopped performing nonessential exams.\n\nIn the areas of Italy most heavily affected by the virus, doctors say they have concluded that loss of taste and smell is an indication that a person who otherwise seems healthy is in fact carrying the virus and may be spreading it to others.\n\n\"Almost everybody who is hospitalized has this same story,\" said Dr. Marco Metra, chief of the cardiology department at the main hospital in Brescia, where 700 of 1,200 inpatients have the coronavirus. \"You ask about the patient's wife or husband. And the patient says, 'My wife has just lost her smell and taste but otherwise she is well.' So she is likely infected, and she is spreading it with a very mild form.\"\n\nA study from South Korea, where widespread testing has been done, found that 30 percent of some 2,000 patients who tested positive for the coronavirus reported experiencing anosmiaHendrik Streeck, a German virologist from the University of Bonn who went from house to house in the country's Heinsberg district to interview coronavirus patients, has said in interviews that at least two-thirds of the more than 100 he talked to with mild disease reported experiencing loss of smell and taste lasting several days.\n\nAnother physician who studied a cluster of coronavirus patients in Germany said in an email that roughly half of the patients had experienced a smell or taste disorder, and that the sensory loss usually presented after the first symptoms of respiratory illness, but could be used to distinguish people who should be tested.\n\nDr. Clemens Wendtner, a professor of medicine at the Academic Teaching Hospital of Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, said that the patients regained their ability to smell after a few days or weeks, and that the loss occurred regardless of how sick they got or whether they were congested. Using nasal drops or sprays did not help, Dr. Wendtner said.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nSeveral American patients who have had symptoms consistent with the coronavirus, but who have not been tested or are still awaiting test results, described losing their senses of smell and taste, even though their noses were clear and they were not congested.\n\nAndrew Berry, 30, developed a fever and body aches about 10 days ago, and then a sore throat and debilitating headaches. He tested negative for influenza and has not gotten the result of a coronavirus test taken four days ago, but his physician was convinced that he had the virus, he said.\n\nNow, Mr. Berry said, he literally cannot smell the coffee.\n\n\"Even with a clear nose, I just realized I couldn't smell the food that I was cooking, and I couldn't taste the food that I was making,\" said Mr. Berry, a tattoo artist based in Orlando, Fla. He was cooking a plantain dish with onions and vinegar, yet he could not smell it.\n\nAmy Plattmier, a woman from Brooklyn, was not tested for the coronavirus during a recent illness, but her husband then became sick and had a positive test. Ms. Plattmier said she usually had a very sensitive nose, but now could barely smell anything -- not the bleach she was using to clean the counters, which usually makes her feel nauseated, or the dog's accident in the bathroom, which she cleaned up.\n\nMr. Berry has also lost some weight, because he has not had much of an appetite. \"Hopefully it's not a prolonged effect,\" he said. \"I can imagine it changes the quality of life.\"\n\nDavid Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from London.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

"title": "Coronavirus Ravages 7 Members of a Single Family, Killing 2", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nGrace Fusco -- mother of 11, grandmother of 27 -- would sit in the same pew at church each Sunday, surrounded by nearly a dozen members of her sprawling Italian-American family. Sunday dinners drew an even larger crowd to her home in central New Jersey.\n\nNow, her close-knit clan is united anew by unspeakable grief: Mrs. Fusco, 73, and four of her children are hospitalized with coronavirus. Two children who contracted the virus have died in the last week.\n\nMrs. Fusco's eldest child, Rita Fusco-Jackson, 55, of Freehold, N.J., died Friday with the virus, a relative said. Her eldest son, Carmine Fusco, of Bath, Pa., died on Wednesday, said the relative, Roseann Paradiso Fodera.\n\nThree of the four siblings who remain hospitalized are in critical condition, Ms. Paradiso Fodera said.\n\nMrs. Fusco, of Freehold, is \"gravely ill\" and breathing with help from a ventilator, said Ms. Paradiso Fodera, a lawyer who is Mrs. Fusco's cousin and is serving as a family spokeswoman.\n\n\"My cousin Grace doesn't realize her two oldest children have passed,\" she said.\n\nNearly 20 other relatives are quarantined at their homes, praying in isolated solitude, unable to mourn their deep collective loss together.\n\n\"If they're not on a respirator, they're quarantined,\" Ms. Paradiso Fodera said.\n\n\"It is so pitiful,\" she added. \"They can't even mourn the way you would.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, five New Jersey residents had died after contracting the virus, which has infected at least 427 people statewide. Nationwide, at least 7,047 people across every state, plus Washington, D.C., and three U.S. territories, have tested positive for coronavirus, and at least 121 have died, according to a New York Times database.\n\nBut the virus's devastating toll on a single family is considered as rare as it is perplexing.\n\n\"They're young and they don't have any underlying conditions,\" Ms. Paradiso Fodero said.\n\nMrs. Fusco and four of her children are being treated at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold, about an hour south of Manhattan, relatives said. Mr. Fusco died at a Pennsylvania hospital near his home, Ms. Paradiso Fodera said.\n\nThe family has deep ties to the horse-racing industry near Freehold Raceway. Some trained horses. Others raced them. The children's father, Vincenzo L. Fusco, did both, according to his obituary.\n\nA person who had contact with a man who died in New Jersey on March 10, becoming the state's first coronavirus-related fatality, had attended a recent Fusco family gathering, the state's health commissioner, Judith M. Persichilli, has said.\n\nThe first New Jersey man to die has been identified by a close friend and the harness track where he worked, Yonkers Raceway, as John Brennan.\n\nMs. Paradiso Fodera said the gathering was a routine Tuesday dinner.\n\n\"A party to most people was a regular dinner to them,\" she said before counting names on a family tree that listed 27 grandchildren.\n\nThe gathering is believed to be the source of the virus, and information about the number of people infected there led to a new intensity in Ms. Persichilli's warnings over the weekend against even small get-togethers with friends or relatives.\n\n\"I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to take personal responsibility and to avoid even small gatherings,\" Ms. Persichilli said during a press briefing on Sunday.\n\nDr. James Matera, chief medical officer of CentraState Medical Center, said he had discussed the uniqueness of treating so many members of the same family with the state's health commissioner and officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHe said officials are in the process of evaluating the patients' medical histories to look for clues about why the disease might have progressed so rapidly, and been so potent.\n\n\"I don't know if it's a strain thing,\" Dr. Matera said. \"I would consider these particular people to be unusual.\"\n\nMs. Fusco-Jackson died a day before her test for coronavirus came back positive on Saturday evening.\n\nHer relatives are urging officials at CentraState or the C.D.C. to conduct an autopsy to learn more about how the virus killed Ms. Fusco-Jackson. She had been in good health, they said, and taught religious education classes at the Roman Catholic church where many members of the large extended family worshiped, St. Robert Bellarmine in Freehold.\n\nMs. Fusco-Jackson, a mother of three, also sang in the choir, coordinated parish weddings and volunteered in the church's gardening club, the pastor, Msgr. Sam Sirianni, said.\n\nShe had attended a retreat for students preparing for the sacrament of confirmation on Feb. 29, but her contact with participants was minimal, the church said on Facebook.\n\n\"I can't tell you enough about her,\" Monsignor Sirianni said on Wednesday in an interview. \"She was always willing to assist and to lead.\"\n\nThe family was among the founding members of the church, he added.\n\n\"Until this virus came, they were still the family that would gather for Sunday dinner,\" Monsignor Sirianni said. \"If grandma was there, everybody came.\"\n\nThe church has since been deep-cleaned, and Monsignor Sirianni, like all members of the parish staff, is operating under quarantine based on possible exposure.\n\n\"It means I turn to the Lord even more,\" Monsignor Sirianni said. \"What came to mind last week was. 'Lord save your people.' And that's been one of my mantras when I go to pray.\"\n\nHe said he was struggling to come to terms with being unable to visit the sick at CentraState.\n\nIn addition to those who have tested positive for coronavirus at CentraState, a midsize hospital that operates as a nonprofit, 27 community members who have been tested for the virus but are awaiting results are hospitalized under observation, Dr. Matera said on Wednesday.\n\nHe said the lengthy turnaround time for test results leaves patients in the dark and burdens the hospital's limited resources. Patients who might ultimately test negative for coronavirus, and be healthy enough to leave the hospital, are instead being kept in isolation.\n\nIf tests were returned more quickly, more patients could be discharged.\n\n\"That opens up beds,\" Dr. Matera said. \"It lowers the anxiety of the staff.\"\n\nMs. Fusco-Jackson's relatives also believe that speedier test results could have made a difference in her care.\n\n\"They didn't treat her as a confirmed case because everything is so delayed,\" Ms. Paradiso Fodera said. \"It's a big bureaucracy. The testing result time is important.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tracey_tully@nytimes.com", "name": "Tracey Tully",

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/health/coronavirus-young-people.html", "title": "Younger Adults Comprise Big Portion of Coronavirus Hospitalizations in U.S.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nAmerican adults of all ages -- not just those in their 70s, 80s and 90s -- are being seriously sickened by the coronavirus, according to a report on nearly 2,500 of the first recorded cases in the United States.\n\nThe report, issued Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that -- as in other countries -- the oldest patients had the greatest likelihood of dying and of being hospitalized. But of the 508 patients known to have been hospitalized, 38 percent were notably younger -- between 20 and 54. And nearly half of the 121 patients who were admitted to intensive care units were adults under 65, the C.D.C. reported.\n\n\"I think everyone should be paying attention to this,\" said Stephen S. Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. \"It's not just going to be the elderly. There will be people age 20 and up. They do have to be careful, even if they think that they're young and healthy.\"\n\nThe findings served to underscore an appeal issued Wednesday at a White House briefing by Dr. Deborah Birx, a physician and State Department official who is a leader of the administration's coronavirus task force. Citing similar reports of young adults in Italy and in France being hospitalized and needing intensive care, Dr. Birx implored the millennial generation to stop socializing in groups and to take care to protect themselves and others.\n\n\"You have the potential then to spread it to someone who does have a condition that none of us knew about, and cause them to have a disastrous outcome,\" Dr. Birx said, addressing young people.\n\nIn the C.D.C. report, 20 percent of the hospitalized patients and 12 percent of the intensive care patients were between the ages of 20 and 44, basically spanning the millennial generation.\n\n\"Younger people may feel more confident about their ability to withstand a virus like this,\" said Dr. Christopher Carlsten, head of respiratory medicine at the University of British Columbia. But, he said, \"if that many younger people are being hospitalized, that means that there are a lot of young people in the community that are walking around with the infection.\"\n\nThe new data represents a preliminary look at the first significant wave of cases in the United States that does not include people who returned to the country from Wuhan, China, or from Japan, the authors reported. Between Feb. 12 and March 16, there were 4,226 such cases reported to the C.D.C., the study says.\n\nThe ages were reported for 2,449 of those patients, the C.D.C. said, and of those, 6 percent were 85 and older, and 25 percent were between 65 and 84. Twenty-nine percent were aged 20 to 44.\n\nThe age groups of 55 to 64 and 45 to 54 each included 18 percent of the total. Only 5 percent of cases were diagnosed in people 19 and younger.\n\nThe risk of a patient requiring hospitalization or dying of the infection caused by the coronavirus increased with age, as has been the pattern in other countries.\n\nThe report included no information about whether patients of any age had underlying risk factors, such as a chronic illness or a compromised immune system. So, it is impossible to determine whether the younger patients who were hospitalized were more susceptible to serious infection than most others in their age group.\n\nBut experts said that even if younger people in the report were medical outliers, the fact that they were taking up hospital beds and space in intensive care units was significant.\n\nAnd these more serious cases represent the leading edge of how the pandemic is rapidly unfolding in the United States, showing that adults of all ages are susceptible and should be concerned about protecting their own health, and not transmitting the virus to others.\n\nThe youngest age group, people 19 and under, accounted for less than 1 percent of the hospitalizations, and none of the I.C.U. admissions or deaths. This dovetails with data from other countries so far. This week, however, the largest study to date of pediatric cases in China found that a small segment of very young children may need hospitalization for very serious symptoms, and that one 14-year-old boy in China died from the virus.\n\nOf the 44 people whose deaths were recorded in the report, 15 were age 85 or older and 20 were between the ages of 65 to 84. There were nine deaths among adults age 20 to 64, the report said.\n\nSome of the patients in the study are still sick, the authors noted, so the results of their cases are unclear. Data was missing for a number of the cases, \"which likely resulted in an underestimation of the outcomes,\" the authors wrote. Because of the missing data, the authors presented percentages of hospitalizations, I.C.U. admissions and deaths as a range. The report also says that the limited testing available in the United States so far makes this report only an early snapshot of the crisis.\n\nStill, the authors wrote, \"these preliminary data also demonstrate that severe illness leading to hospitalization, including I.C.U. admission and death, can occur in adults of any age with Covid-19.\"\n\nRoni Caryn Rabin contributed reporting.", "source":

Map: Cases Now Reported in All 50 States", "body": "The coronavirus has now been identified in all 50 U.S. states, and more than 140 deaths in the country have been linked to the illness. Those known deaths, all from the past three weeks, come as the number of diagnoses has surged into the thousands as the virus has spread and as testing has expanded significantly. On Wednesday morning, more than 1,000 new cases were announced in New York State.\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, at least 8,264 people across every state, plus Washington, D.C., and three U.S. territories, have tested positive for coronavirus, according to a New York Times database, and at least 147 patients with the virus have died.\n\nAs the United States scrambled to understand the scope of an escalating public health crisis, life in many states has come to a standstill: Schools and businesses have closed. Parties, meetings and sporting events have been canceled. In some places, residents have been ordered to stay inside.\n\nRead about how the virus upended one small American town.\n\nAs the death toll surpassed 140 on Wednesday, the danger that the coronavirus poses -- especially to older people and those with health problems -- became even more clear.\n\nAt least 35 of the deaths were connected to a single nursing center in Washington, and residents of other long-term care facilities -- in Kansas, South Carolina and at least two other centers in Washington -- have also died.\n\nSee our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak for the latest news.\n\nSeveral hundred new cases are now being identified each day, including more than 1,300 on Tuesday. The pace of diagnosis is expected to quicken as the virus spreads and testing becomes more widely available. More state and private labs have started running tests for the coronavirus in recent days, increasing the capacity to identify new patients after weeks of delays and test kit shortages.\n\nThe outbreak looks vastly different today than it did just a couple of weeks ago. At the start of March, 70 cases had been reported in the United States, most of them tied to overseas travel. Since then, new cases have poured in by the hundreds and thousands, including more than 2,500 between the start of Tuesday and midday Wednesday. The virus is now spreading in parts of the country where it had not been identified as recently as 10 days ago, including Louisiana, which now has at least 257 known cases.\n\nThe New York Times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track details about every confirmed case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest information our journalists are gathering from around the country.\n\nThe number of patients treated in the United States remains a small fraction of those with the virus overseas, where thousands of people have died and tens of thousands have been infected.\n\nSee our maps tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world.\n\nAs about 100 new patients have been identified each recent day in Washington State, officials there have scrambled to impose restrictions on public gatherings and slow the transmission rate.\n\nWith hospitals stretched thin, officials in King County, which includes Seattle, announced the acquisition of a motel to use as an isolation area. They also purchased a \"fully self-contained tent, with flooring and heat\" to hold more people with the illness. And with more than 60 deaths reported in the state, officials banned gatherings of more than 50 people and ordered the closure of theaters, fitness clubs and bars.\n\n\"We are at a critical moment in this crisis,\" the King County executive, Dow Constantine, said in a statement. He added: \"Go to work if you must. But hunker down if you are able. Postpone anything you can. Treat the next two weeks as a period of self-quarantine, to protect yourself and the lives and health of your loved ones and the entire community.\"\n\nWashington is not the only West Coast state to be hit hard. Community spread of the virus has been reported in many parts of California, where local officials were among the first to cancel large gatherings, and in Oregon, where several cases have been linked to a home for veterans. Most of the first patients on the West Coast traveled in China or were passengers on two cruise ships where outbreaks emerged. But as the virus has circulated widely within those states, and as the number of diagnoses has increased from a few-dozen to many hundreds, officials have been unable to pinpoint how most of the newest patients became ill.\n\nAs more U.S. patients were diagnosed without any history of overseas travel, it became clear that people were being exposed in schools, offices and medical facilities. Among the latest cases: A person in southwest Missouri who had traveled to another part of the country, and three people in Nevada who had contact with a previous coronavirus patient.\n\nSince announcing their first case of coronavirus on March 1, health officials in New York State have raced to contain the virus's spread as the number of confirmed diagnoses has surged past 2,300.\n\nMany of the early cases there were traced to a man from Westchester County who attended public gatherings before knowing he had the coronavirus. The National Guard has been deployed in New Rochelle, the center of that outbreak.\n\nIn addition to Westchester County, patients were being treated in several New York City boroughs, on Long Island and in more than a dozen other counties. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, warned that intensive care units would soon be full and asked President Trump to send the Army Corps of Engineers to retrofit university dorms and other buildings to house those patients. Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Trump accused the other of not doing enough to control the virus.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time before our state's ICU beds fill up.,\" Mr. Cuomo wrote Monday on Twitter.\n\nSince the first coronavirus deaths in the United States were reported on Feb. 29 in King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, officials there have continued to announce fatal cases of the illness.\n\nBy Tuesday, 35 deaths had been tied to the Life Care Center nursing facility in Kirkland, Wash., where dozens of residents, staff members and visitors were sickened. Many of those cases involved older people with other health problems that made them especially vulnerable to coronavirus. Cases have also been reported at other nursing facilities in the Seattle area.\n\nAmong the people in the United States who have died from coronavirus, almost all have been in their 70s, 80s or 90s. The youngest known fatality was a man in his 40s.\n\nWhile the majority of deaths tied to coronavirus have been in Washington, more and more states have reported fatal cases in recent days. In New York, seven deaths have been announced since Saturday. In Indiana, the state's first fatality was made public on Monday. And in South Carolina, a resident of a long-term care facility died shortly after being diagnosed, the first coronavirus-related death in that state.\n\n\"This is an example of the importance of taking precautions to protect those at higher risk, like the elderly and people with serious underlying health conditions,\" said Dr. Brannon Traxler of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nForty-three Americans who spent time aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where the virus spread among passengers and crew members as it was docked in Japan, were later treated in the United States, receiving care at hospitals in California, Texas, Nebraska, Utah and Washington State.\n\nSeveral residents of Maryland, Iowa, Texas and Virginia who tested positive for the virus contracted it on an Egyptian cruise of the Nile River, state and local officials said. And at least 21 people who traveled on a leg of a Grand Princess cruise from San Francisco in February have tested positive in the United States.\n\nAt least 21 more coronavirus patients sailed on a subsequent Grand Princess cruise that arrived in California last week. Others on that ship who had not tested positive were sent to quarantine on military bases. By this week, those passengers had started to be sent home to self-quarantine, including 29 people from Wisconsin who arrived there on Sunday.\n\n\"We're glad to finally have our folks back home in Wisconsin,\" the state's governor, Tony Evers, said in a statement. \"These individuals have gone through a harrowing experience full of uncertainty and fear.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

Coronavirus", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- Senator Richard M. Burr sold hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock in major companies last month, as President Trump and others in his party were still playing down the threat presented by the coronavirus outbreak and before the stock market's precipitous plunge.\n\nThe stocks were sold in mid-February, days after Mr. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, wrote an opinion piece for Fox News suggesting that the United States was \"better prepared than ever before\" to confront the virus.\n\nTwo weeks after the sales, Mr. Burr spoke at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington to a nonpartisan group called the Tar Heel Club, warning that the virus could soon cause a major disruption in the United States.\n\nThe gathering, which drew fewer than 100 people, included representatives from the North Carolina governor's office, as well as staff members from other congressional offices in the state.\n\n\"There's one thing that I can tell you about this -- it is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything we have seen in recent history,\" Mr. Burr said, according to a recording obtained by NPR, which reported on his remarks on Thursday. \"It's probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Senate Republican plan includes corporate tax cuts, limits on paid leave and $1,200 checks for taxpayers. Italy's death toll soars, surpassing China's, as other nations in Europe report upticks. Trump administration's plea to states: Keep mum about unemployment stats. See more updates More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nHe added: \"Every company should be cognizant of the fact that you may have to alter your travel. You may have to look at your employees and judge whether the trip they're making to Europe is essential or whether it can be done on video conference.\"\n\nMr. Burr has long pushed for the United States to better prepare for the threat presented by pandemics, including sponsoring legislation that Congress passed in 2006 called the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act.\n\n\"His message has always been, and continues to be, that we must be prepared to protect American lives in the event of a pandemic or bio-attack,\" Caitlin Carroll, a spokeswoman for Mr. Burr, said in a statement. \"Since early February, whether in constituent meetings or open hearings, he has worked to educate the public about the tools and resources our government has to confront the spread of coronavirus.\"\n\nIn a series of posts on Twitter, Mr. Burr accused NPR of twisting his comments into a \"tabloid-style hit piece.\" He argued that the report made him look duplicitous for sharing information at a publicly advertised event that was consistent with the message members of the Trump administration were then trying to promulgate. He did not address his stock sales.\n\nAs the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr receives regular briefings on threats to the United States, including the coronavirus. He is also a member of the Senate health committee, which in January hosted a briefing with top Trump administration officials open to all senators.\n\nThe record of Mr. Burr's stock transaction shows he and his wife sold 33 different stocks on Feb. 13, which were collectively worth $628,000 to $1.7 million, according to the disclosures filed with the secretary of the Senate. Those sales include as much as $150,000 worth of stock in two hotel chains, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Extended Stay America. The value of both companies has declined significantly in recent weeks. He also sold as much as $65,000 worth of stock in Park Hotels & Resorts.\n\nCongress began requiring its members to disclose their stock sales in 2012, when it passed a law called Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, which was intended to prevent lawmakers from using inside information to profit. The forms do not require lawmakers to record their actual earnings from those sales, just a range of the value of each transaction.\n\nDetails of Mr. Burr's stock sales were first reported by the Center for Responsive Politics, which maintains a database of congressional stock transactions.\n\nThe sales by Mr. Burr appear to represent a significant share of his stock holdings, according to his most recent annual financial report.\n\nThe virus outbreak first surfaced in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan. By mid-February, Mr. Trump continued to play down the threat.\n\n\"I think the numbers are going to get progressively better as we go along,\" Mr. Trump said on Feb. 19.\n\nAides to Mr. Burr said that the decision to sell the stocks was a private one, which took place long before the stock market plunged and evidence of a widespread health threat emerged in the United States.\n\nLiberal groups quickly sought to capitalize on the sales, suggesting that Mr. Burr should give up his office and advancing unsupported claims that he may have broken the law.\n\n\"Senator Burr needs to resign immediately,\" said Zach Hudson, a spokesman for American Bridge, a Democratic advocacy group. \"His conduct as detailed by this report represents a gross violation of the public's trust and he must be held accountable for his behavior that appears criminal.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_lipton@nytimes.com",

On Friday night, the authorities tightened the nationwide lockdown, closing parks, banning outdoor activities including walking or jogging far from home.\n\nThe tragedy of Italy now stands as a warning to its European neighbors and the United States, where the virus is coming with equal velocity. If Italy's experience shows anything, it is that measures to isolate affected areas and limit the movement of the broader population need to be taken early, put in place with absolute clarity, then strictly enforced.\n\nDespite now having some of the toughest measures in the world, Italian authorities fumbled many of those steps early in the contagion -- when it most mattered as they sought to preserve basic civil liberties as well as the economy.\n\nItaly's piecemeal attempts to cut it off -- isolating towns first, then regions, then shutting down the country in an intentionally porous lockdown -- always lagged behind the virus's lethal trajectory.\n\n\"Now we are running after it,\" said Sandra Zampa, the under secretary at the Ministry of Health, who said Italy did the best it could given the information it had. \"We closed gradually, as Europe is doing. France, Spain, Germany, the U.S. are doing the same. Every day you close a bit, you give up on a bit of normal life. Because the virus does not allow normal life.\"\n\nSome officials gave in to magical thinking, reluctant to make painful decisions sooner. All the while, the virus fed on that complacency.\n\nGovernments beyond Italy are now in danger of following the same path, repeating familiar mistakes and inviting similar calamity. And unlike Italy, which navigated uncharted territory for a Western democracy, other governments have less room for excuses.\n\nItalian officials, for their part, have defended their response, emphasizing that the crisis is unprecedented in modern times. They assert that the government responded with speed and competence, immediately acting on the advice of its scientists and moving more swiftly on drastic, economically devastating measures than their European counterparts.\n\nBut tracing the record of their actions shows missed opportunities and critical missteps that have left the country in its worse state since World War II.\n\nIn the critical early days of the outbreak, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and other top officials sought to down play the threat, creating confusion and a false sense of security that allowed the virus to spread.\n\nThey blamed Italy's high number of infections on aggressive testing of people without symptoms in the north, which they argued only created hysteria and tarnished the country's image abroad.\n\nEven once the Italian government considered a universal lockdown necessary to defeat the virus, it failed to communicate the threat powerfully enough to persuade Italians to abide by the rules, which seemed riddled with loopholes.\n\n\"It is not easy in a liberal democracy,\" said Walter Ricciardi, a World Health Organization board member and a top adviser to the health ministry, who argued that the Italian government acted on the scientific evidence made available to it.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak With climbing state caseloads, the federal government is under pressure. Governors set out new rules of life as strain builds in New York City's hospitals. 103 American passengers remain stranded on the Silver Shadow cruise liner. See more updates More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nHe said the Italian government had moved at a much faster clip, and took the threat much more seriously, than its European neighbors or the United States.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that the health minister had struggled to persuade his government colleagues to move more quickly and that the difficulties of navigating Italy's division of powers between Rome and the regions resulted in a fragmented chain of command and inconsistent messages.\n\n\"In times of war, like an epidemic,\" that system presented grave problems, he said, adding that it perhaps delayed the imposing of restrictive measures.\n\n\"I would have done them 10 days before, that is the only difference.\"\n\nIt Could Never Happen Here\n\nFor the coronavirus, 10 days can be a lifetime.\n\nOn Jan. 21, as top Chinese officials warned that those hiding virus cases \"will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity,\" Italy's culture and tourism minister hosted a Chinese delegation for a concert at the National Academy of Santa Cecilia to inaugurate the year of Italy-China Culture and Tourism.\n\nMichele Geraci, Italy's former under secretary in the economic development ministry and a booster of closer relations with China, had a drink with other politicians but looked around uneasily.\n\n\"Are we sure we want to do this?\" he said he asked them. \"Should we be here today?\"\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, Italian officials say certainly not.\n\nMs. Zampa, the health ministry under secretary, said in retrospect she would have closed everything immediately. But in real time, it wasn't that clear.\n\nPoliticians across the spectrum worried about the economy and feeding the country, and found it difficult to accept their impotence in the face of the virus.\n\nMost importantly, Italy looked at the example of China, Ms. Zampa said, not as a practical warning, but as a \"science fiction movie that had nothing to do with us.\" And when the virus exploded, Europe, she said, \"looked at us the same way we looked at China.\"\n\nBut already in January, some officials on the right were urging Mr. Conte, their former ally and now political enemy, to quarantine schoolchildren in the northern regions who were returning from holidays in China, a measure aimed at protecting schools. Many of those children were from Chinese immigrant families.\n\nMany liberals criticized the proposal as populist fear-mongering. Mr. Conte declined the proposal and responded that the northern governors should trust the judgment of education and health authorities whom, he said, had proposed no such thing.\n\nBut Mr. Conte also demonstrated that he was taking the threat of contagion seriously. On Jan. 30, he blocked all flights in and out of China.\n\n\"We are the first country in Europe to adopt such a precautionary measure,\" he said.\n\nOver the next month, Italy responded swiftly to coronavirus scares. Two sick Chinese tourists and an Italian returning from China received care from a prominent infectious disease hospital in Rome. A false alarm led authorities to briefly confine passengers on a cruise ship docked outside of Rome.\n\n'Patient One,' Super-spreader\n\nWhen a 38-year-old man went to the emergency room at a hospital in Codogno, a small town in the Lodi province of Lombardy, with severe flu symptoms on Feb. 18, the case did not set off alarms.\n\nThe patient declined to be hospitalized and went home. He got sicker and returned to the hospital a few hours later and was admitted to a general medicine ward. On Feb. 20, he went into intensive care, where he tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe man, who became known as Patient One, had had a busy month. He attended at least three dinners, played soccer and ran with a team, all apparently while contagious and without heavy symptoms.\n\nMr. Ricciardi said Italy had the bad luck of having a super spreader in a densely populated and dynamic area who went to the hospital not once, but twice, infecting hundreds of people, including doctors and nurses.\n\n\"He was incredibly active,\" Mr. Ricciardi said.\n\nBut he also had not had any direct contacts with China, and experts suspect he contracted the virus from another European, meaning Italy did not have an identifiable patient zero or a traceable source of contagion that could help it contain the virus.\n\nThe virus had already been active in Italy for weeks by that time, experts now say, passed by people without symptoms and often mistaken for a flu. It spread around Lombardy, the Italian region that has by far the most trade with China and the home of Milan, the country's most culturally vibrant and business-centered city.\n\n\"Who we call 'Patient One' was probably 'Patient 200,' \" said Fabrizio Pregliasco, an epidemiologist.\n\nOn Sunday, Feb. 23, the number of infections clicked passed 130 and Italy sealed off 11 towns with police and military checkpoints. The last days of Venice Carnival were canceled. The Lombardy region closed its schools, museums and movie theaters. The Milanese made a run on the supermarkets.\n\nBut while Mr. Conte again commended Italy for its firm hand, he also sought to downplay the contagion, attributing the high numbers of infected to Lombardy's overzealous testing.\n\n\"We have been the first country in the European Union to opt for more rigorous and strict controls in airports and cities,\" he said in an address to the nation. \"We have more people infected because we made more swabs.\"\n\nThe next day, as infections surpassed 200, seven people died and the stock market plunged, Mr. Conte and his health aides doubled down.\n\nHe blamed the Codogno hospital for the spread, saying it had handled things in \"a not-completely-proper way\" and argued that Lombardy and Veneto, another northern region, were inflating the severity of the problem by diverging from global guidelines and testing people without symptoms.\n\nAs Lombardy officials scrambled to free up hospital beds, and the number of infected people rose to 309 with 11 dead, Mr. Conte said on Feb. 25 that \"Italy is a safe country and probably safer than many others.\"\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Conte's office offered an interview on the condition that he could answer questions in writing. When sent questions, including those about his past statements, he declined to respond.\n\nMixed Messages Sow Confusion\n\nReassurances from leaders confused the Italian population.\n\nOn Feb. 27, Mr. Zingaretti posted his aperitivo picture. That same day, the country's foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, the former leader of one of the governing parties, the Five Star Movement, held a news conference in Rome.\n\n\"In Italy, we went from the risk of an epidemic to an infodemic,\" Mr. Di Maio said, disparaging media coverage that highlighted the threat of the contagion, and adding that only \"0.089 percent\" of the Italian population was quarantined.\n\nIn Milan, only miles from the center of the outbreak, the mayor, Beppe Sala, publicized a ''Milan Doesn't Stop'' campaign, and the Duomo, the city's landmark cathedral that is a draw for tourists, reopened. People went out.\n\nBut on the sixth floor of the regional government headquarters in Milan, Giacomo Grasselli, who is the coordinator of the intensive care units throughout Lombardy, saw the numbers going up and quickly realized that it would be impossible to treat all the sick if the infections continued unabated.\n\nHis task force worked to match the sick to beds in intensive-care units in the nearest possible hospitals and appropriate dwindling resources.\n\nAt one of the daily meetings of about 20 health and political officials, he told the regional president, Attilio Fontana, about the growing numbers.\n\nAn epidemiologist showed the curves of infection. There was a catastrophe facing the region's well-respected health system.\n\n\"We need to do something more,\" Mr. Grasselli told the room.\n\nMr. Fontana, who had been pressing the central government for tougher action, agreed. He said that the mixed messages from Rome and the easing of restrictions had led Italians to believe \"that everything was a joke, and they kept living as they used to.\"\n\nHe said he appealed for tougher national measures in video conferences with the prime minister and other regional presidents, arguing that climbing numbers of cases threatened to collapse the hospital system in the north, but that his requests were repeatedly turned down.\n\n\"They were convinced that the situation was less serious and they did not want to hurt our economy too much,\" said Mr. Fontana.\n\nThe government started providing some economic assistance, which would later be followed by a 25 billion euro ($28 billion) relief package, but the nation became divided between those who saw the threat and those who didn't.\n\nMs. Zampa said that it was around that time that government learned that infections in the town of V\u00f2, the virus epicenter of the Veneto region, had no epidemiological link to the Codogno outbreak.\n\nShe said that the health minister, Mr. Speranza, and Mr. Conte deliberated about what to do and within the day, they decided to close down much of the north.\n\nIn a surprise 2 a.m. news conference on March 8, when 7,375 people had already tested positive for coronavirus and 366 had died, Mr. Conte announced the extraordinary step of restricting movement for about a quarter of the Italian population in the northern regions that serve as the country's economic engine.\n\n\"We are facing an emergency,\" Mr. Conte said at the time. \"A national emergency.\"\n\nA draft of the decree, leaked to Italian media on Saturday night, pushed many Milan residents to rush to the train station in crowds and attempt to leave the region, causing what many later considered a dangerous wave of contagion toward the south.\n\nYet the following day, most Italians were still confused about the severity of the restrictions.\n\nTo clarify the issue, the interior ministry issued \"auto-certification\" forms that would allow people to travel in and out of the locked-down area for work, health or \"other\" necessities.\n\nIn the meantime, some regional governors independently ordered people coming from the newly locked-down area to self quarantine. Others didn't.\n\nThe broader restrictions in Lombardy also effectively lifted the quarantine on Codogno and other \"red zone\" towns linked to the original outbreak. Checkpoints disappeared. Local mayors complained that their sacrifices had been wasted.\n\nThree days later, on March 11, when the positive cases reached 12,462 and the death toll climbed to 827, Mr. Conte toughened the restrictions and extended them nationally.\n\nBut by then, some experts say, it was already too late.\n\nLocal Experiments\n\nItaly is still paying the price of those early mixed messages by scientists and politicians. The staggering number of deaths announced in recent days -- more than 1,500 in the last three days -- are of people infected during the confusion of a week or two ago.\n\nRoberto Burioni, a prominent virologist at the San Raffaele University in Milan, said that people had felt safe to go about their usual routines and he attributed the spike in cases last week to \"that behavior.\"\n\nThe government has urged national unity in obeying its restrictive measures. But on Saturday, hundreds of mayors from the hardest-hit areas told the government those measures were fatally insufficient.\n\nLeaders in the north are desperate for the government to crack down harder.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Fontana complained that the 114 troops the government deployed were insignificant, and that at least 1,000 should be sent. He said in an interview that the government needed to stop messing around and \"apply rigid measures.\"\n\n\"My idea is that if we had shut everything in the beginning, for two weeks, probably now we would be celebrating victory,\" he said.\n\nHis political ally, Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto region, pre-empted the national government with his own crackdown, and said that Rome needed to enforce \"a more drastic isolation,\" including closing all stores and prohibiting public activities other than commuting to work.\n\n\"Walks should be banned,\" he said.\n\nMr. Zaia has some credibility on the issue. As new infections have proliferated around the country, they have significantly dropped in V\u00f2, a town of about 3,000 people that was one of the first quarantined and which had the country's first coronavirus death.\n\nSome government experts attributed that turnaround to the strict quarantine that had been in place for two weeks. But Mr. Zaia had also ordered blanket tests there, in defiance of international scientific guidelines and the national government. The government has argued that testing people without symptoms is a drain on resources.\n\n\"At least this slows down the virus' speed,'' Mr. Zaia said, arguing that testing helped identify potentially contagious people without symptoms. ''And slowing down the virus' speed allows the hospitals to breathe.''\n\nIf not, the overwhelming number of patients would crater health care systems and cause a national catastrophe.\n\nAmericans and others, he said, \"need to be ready.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_horowitz@nytimes.com", "name": "Jason

public leadership shown by Cuomo, Trudeau and Merkel.\n\nIn a time of global emergency, we need calm, directness and, above all, hard facts. Only the opposite is on offer from the Trump White House. It is therefore time to call the president's news conferences for what they are: propaganda.\n\nWe may as well be watching newsreels approved by the Soviet Politburo. We're witnessing the falsification of history in real time. When Donald Trump, under the guise of social distancing, told the White House press corps on Thursday that he ought to get rid of 75 to 80 percent of them -- reserving the privilege only for those he liked -- it may have been chilling, but it wasn't surprising. He wants to thin out their ranks until there's only Pravda in the room.\n\nSometimes, I stare at Deborah Birx during these briefings and I wonder if she understands that this is the footage historians will be looking at 100 years from now -- the president rambling on incoherently, vainly, angrily, deceitfully, while she watches, her face stiff with the strangled horror of a bride enduring an inappropriate toast.\n\nIf the public wants factual news briefings, they need to tune in to those who are giving them: Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose addresses appear with English subtitles on Deutsche Welle. They should start following the many civic-minded epidemiologists and virologists and contagion experts on Twitter, like Harvard's Marc Lipsitch and Yale's Nicholas Christakis, whose threads have been invaluable primers in a time of awful confusion.\n\nThese are people with a high tolerance for uncertainty. It's the president's incapacity to tolerate it -- combined with his bottomless need to self-flatter and preserve his political power -- that leads, so often, to his spectacular fits of deception and misdirection. At his Thursday news conference, a discussion of chloroquine and other experimental therapies formed the core of his remarks, when those drugs and therapies are untested and unproven and, in some cases, won't be ready for several months, as NBC's Peter Alexander pointed out the following day.\n\n\"What do you say to Americans who are scared?\" Alexander pressed.\n\n\"I say that you're a terrible reporter,\" Trump answered.\n\nOnly a liar -- and a weak man with delusions of competence -- would be so unnerved by the facts.\n\nCompare this to Andrew Cuomo, who takes questions at his news conferences calmly and systematically -- and, more to the point, has a substantive response when asked the same questions about anxiety. He hears it. He relates to it. He says it's real.\n\n\"People are in a small apartment, they're in a house, they're worried, they're anxious. Just, be mindful of that,\" the governor said Friday. \"Those three-word sentences can make all the difference: 'I miss you. I love you. I'm thinking about you. I wish I was there with you. I'm sorry you're going through this. I'm sorry we're going through this.' \"\n\nOn Friday, Cuomo said something else that was quite striking, as he was issuing his executive order for nonessential workers in New York to stay home, other than to run errands or exercise outside. \"If someone wants to blame someone or complain about someone, blame me,\" he said. \"There is no one else who is responsible for this decision.\"\n\nCuomo is nothing if not politically shrewd. He knows full well how this comment compares to Mr. Trump's \"I don't take responsibility at all.\"\n\nBut telling the media that they're peddling fake news is straight from the playbook of the political gangsters of the last century. So many of Trump's moves are.\n\nHaving each of his cabinet members fulsomely thank him for his leadership and congratulate him for his \"farsightedness\" before each of their remarks: Check. Making sure each one stays on a message, even if that message has nothing to do with his or her purview: Check.\n\n(Alex Azar may have been the worst offender, speaking Friday to the urgency of closing the southern border. He's the secretary of health and human services, not homeland security. Yet he was parroting Trump's message about the coronavirus, one specifically tailored to the base: We're keeping brown immigrants from spreading it.)\n\nHow about Orwellian doublespeak? Ooooooh, check. Trump and his team are continually deploying words and phrases that disguise a reality that suggests the opposite. Vice President Mike Pence talks about a \"strong and seamless\" partnership with the states, when at the same time Mr. Trump is trolling the states, telling Cuomo to get his own respirators.\n\nPence speaks relentlessly of a \"whole of government approach,\" when in fact the government is hollowed out -- defunded to fight pandemics, denuded of experts -- and broken in shards, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sidelined in this fight, and the president's task force now mutely competing with a shadow group run by the president's son-in-law.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said he cherished journalism, and his secretary of state complained about disinformation on Twitter. There are simply too many two-plus-two-is-five moments to count.\n\nBut most dangerous of all is Trump's insistence that things are fine, or will be shortly, that they'll be stronger and better and greater than ever. We don't have any evidence that this is true, and the president finds any suggestion to the contrary quite rude. When a journalist pointed out to him on Thursday that the economy had all but ground to halt, Trump cut him off.\n\n\"What's the rest of your question?\" he snapped. \"We know that. Everybody in the room knows that.\"\n\nHere's the truth: Things might be hard -- unfathomably hard -- for months, perhaps even north of a year. Anyone who's reading or listening to other sources of news besides the president knows that. It takes sensitivity and strength and intelligence to speak truthfully to the public about imminent hardship, the prospect of enduring pain.\n\nSo I listen to Justin Trudeau, a sci-fi experience, a dispatch from an alternate universe that prioritizes the needs and anxieties of the middle class. There's no talk of bailouts of airlines and cruise ships. He speaks about immediate needs: The kids will be all right. There'll be food. You won't be booted out of your home. Not how our president is speaking right now, but it's a road map for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020 to follow.\n\nAnd I listen to Cuomo, who says the same thing. His news conference on Friday was about the practical things, knowing the entire state -- country, globe -- had just taken a precipitous slide down Maslow's hierarchy of needs, with food, shelter and safety now topmost on many people's minds. No one can evict you for 90 days. We're getting hospital beds. We're recruiting doctors and nurses in training to fight this fight, and we're coaxing medical professionals out of retirement.\n\nThen he spoke from the heart. One of his daughters was in quarantine. \"To tell you the truth, I had some of the best conversations with her that I've ever had,\" Cuomo said. She was alone for two weeks. \"We talked about things in depth that we didn't have time to talk about in the past,\" he continued, \"or we didn't have the courage or the strength to talk about in the past -- feelings I had, about mistakes I had made along the way that I wanted to express my regret and talk through with her.\"\n\nHe was expressing fallibility. Imagine that.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- Senator Richard M. Burr sold hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock in major companies last month, as President Trump and others in his party were still playing down the threat presented by the coronavirus outbreak and before the stock market's precipitous plunge.\n\nThe stocks were sold in mid-February, days after Mr. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, wrote an opinion piece for Fox News suggesting that the United States was \"better prepared than ever before\" to confront the virus.\n\nTwo weeks after the sales, Mr. Burr spoke at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington to a nonpartisan group called the Tar Heel Club, warning that the virus could soon cause a major disruption in the United States.\n\nThe gathering, which drew fewer than 100 people, included representatives from the North Carolina governor's office, as well as staff members from other congressional offices in the state.\n\n\"There's one thing that I can tell you about this -- it is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything we have seen in recent history,\" Mr. Burr said, according to a recording obtained by NPR, which reported on his remarks on Thursday. \"It's probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Staying at home \"is not a permanent state,\" California's governor says. Trump administration's plea to states: Keep mum about unemployment stats. Senate Republican plan includes corporate tax cuts and checks for taxpayers. See more updates More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nHe added: \"Every company should be cognizant of the fact that you may have to alter your travel. You may have to look at your employees and judge whether the trip they're making to Europe is essential or whether it can be done on video conference.\"\n\nMr. Burr has long pushed for the United States to better prepare for the threat presented by pandemics, including sponsoring legislation that Congress passed in 2006 called the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act.\n\n\"His message has always been, and continues to be, that we must be prepared to protect American lives in the event of a pandemic or bio-attack,\" Caitlin Carroll, a spokeswoman for Mr. Burr, said in a statement. \"Since early February, whether in constituent meetings or open hearings, he has worked to educate the public about the tools and resources our government has to confront the spread of coronavirus.\"\n\nIn a series of posts on Twitter, Mr. Burr accused NPR of twisting his comments into a \"tabloid-style hit piece.\" He argued that the report made him look duplicitous for sharing information at a publicly advertised event that was consistent with the message members of the Trump administration were then trying to promulgate. He did not address his stock sales.\n\nAs the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Burr receives regular briefings on threats to the United States, including the coronavirus. He is also a member of the Senate health committee, which in January hosted a briefing with top Trump administration officials open to all senators.\n\nThe record of Mr. Burr's stock transaction shows he and his wife sold 33 different stocks on Feb. 13, which were collectively worth $628,000 to $1.7 million, according to the disclosures filed with the secretary of the Senate. Those sales include as much as $150,000 worth of stock in two hotel chains, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Extended Stay America. The value of both companies has declined significantly in recent weeks. He also sold as much as $65,000 worth of stock in Park Hotels & Resorts.\n\nCongress began requiring its members to disclose their stock sales in 2012, when it passed a law called Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, which was intended to prevent lawmakers from using inside information to profit. The forms do not require lawmakers to record their actual earnings from those sales, just a range of the value of each transaction.\n\nDetails of Mr. Burr's stock sales were first reported by ProPublica and the Center for Responsive Politics, which maintains a database of congressional stock transactions.\n\nThe sales by Mr. Burr appear to represent a significant share of his stock holdings, according to his most recent annual financial report.\n\nThe virus outbreak first surfaced in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan. By mid-February, Mr. Trump continued to play down the threat.\n\n\"I think the numbers are going to get progressively better as we go along,\" Mr. Trump said on Feb. 19.\n\nAides to Mr. Burr said that the decision to sell the stocks was a private one, which took place long before the stock market plunged and evidence of a widespread health threat emerged in the United States.\n\nLiberal groups quickly sought to capitalize on the sales, suggesting that Mr. Burr should give up his office and advancing unsupported claims that he may have broken the law.\n\n\"Senator Burr needs to resign immediately,\" said Zach Hudson, a spokesman for American Bridge, a Democratic advocacy group. \"His conduct as detailed by this report represents a gross violation of the public's trust and he must be held accountable for his behavior that appears criminal.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_lipton@nytimes.com",

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/health/coronavirus-restrictions-us.html", "title": "Harsh Steps Are Needed to Stop the Coronavirus, Experts Say", "body": "Terrifying though the coronavirus may be, it can be turned back. China, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that, with furious efforts, the contagion can be brought to heel.\n\nWhether they can keep it suppressed remains to be seen. But for the United States to repeat their successes will take extraordinary levels of coordination and money from the country's leaders, and extraordinary levels of trust and cooperation from citizens. It will also require international partnerships in an interconnected world.\n\nThere is a chance to stop the coronavirus. This contagion has a weakness.\n\nAlthough there are incidents of rampant spread, as happened on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, the coronavirus more often infects clusters of family members, friends and work colleagues, said Dr. David L. Heymann, who chairs an expert panel advising the World Health Organization on emergencies.\n\nNo one is certain why the virus travels in this way, but experts see an opening nonetheless. \"You can contain clusters,\" Dr. Heymann said. \"You need to identify and stop discrete outbreaks, and then do rigorous contact tracing.\"\n\nBut doing so takes intelligent, rapidly adaptive work by health officials, and near-total cooperation from the populace. Containment becomes realistic only when Americans realize that working together is the only way to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n\nIn interviews with a dozen of the world's leading experts on fighting epidemics, there was wide agreement on the steps that must be taken immediately.\n\nThose experts included international public health officials who have fought AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, flu and Ebola; scientists and epidemiologists; and former health officials who led major American global health programs in both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nAmericans must be persuaded to stay home, they said, and a system put in place to isolate the infected and care for them outside the home. Travel restrictions should be extended, they said; productions of masks and ventilators must be accelerated, and testing problems must be resolved.\n\nBut tactics like forced isolation, school closings and pervasive GPS tracking of patients brought more divided reactions.\n\nIt was not at all clear that a nation so fundamentally committed to individual liberty and distrustful of government could learn to adapt to many of these measures, especially those that smack of state compulsion.\n\n\"The American way is to look for better outcomes through a voluntary system,\" said Dr. Luciana Borio, who was director of medical and biodefense preparedness for the National Security Council before it was disbanded in 2018.\n\n\"I think you can appeal to people to do the right thing.\"\n\nIn the week since the interviews began, remarkable changes have come over American life. State governments are telling residents they must stay home. Nonessential businesses are being shuttered.\n\nThe streets are quieter than they have been in generations, and even friends keep a wary distance. What seemed unthinkable just a week ago is rapidly becoming the new normal.\n\nWhat follows are the recommendations offered by the experts interviewed by The Times.\n\nScientists must be heard\n\nThe White House holds frequent media briefings to describe the administration's progress against the pandemic, often led by President Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, flanked by a rotating cast of officials.\n\nMany experts, some of whom are international civil servants, declined to speak on the record for fear of offending the president. But they were united in the opinion that politicians must step aside and let scientists both lead the effort to contain the virus and explain to Americans what must be done.\n\nJust as generals take the lead in giving daily briefings in wartime -- as Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf did during the Persian Gulf war -- medical experts should be at the microphone now to explain complex ideas like epidemic curves, social distancing and off-label use of drugs.\n\nThe microphone should not even be at the White House, scientists said, so that briefings of historic importance do not dissolve into angry, politically charged exchanges with the press corps, as happened again on Friday.\n\nInstead, leaders must describe the looming crisis and the possible solutions in ways that will win the trust of Americans.\n\nAbove all, the experts said, briefings should focus on saving lives and making sure that average wage earners survive the coming hard times -- not on the stock market, the tourism industry or the president's health. There is no time left to point fingers and assign blame.\n\n\"At this point in the emergency, there's little merit in spending time on what we should have done or who's at fault,\" said Adm. Tim Ziemer, who was the coordinator of the President's Malaria Initiative from 2006 until early 2017 and led the pandemic response unit on the National Security Council before its disbanding.\n\n\"We need to focus on the enemy, and that's the virus.\"\n\nStop transmission between cities\n\nThe next priority, experts said, is extreme social distancing.\n\nIf it were possible to wave a magic wand and make all Americans freeze in place for 14 days while sitting six feet apart, epidemiologists say, the whole epidemic would sputter to a halt.\n\nThe virus would die out on every contaminated surface and, because almost everyone shows symptoms within two weeks, it would be evident who was infected. If we had enough tests for every American, even the completely asymptomatic cases could be found and isolated.\n\nThe crisis would be over.\n\nObviously, there is no magic wand, and no 300 million tests. But the goal of lockdowns and social distancing is to approximate such a total freeze.\n\nTo attempt that, experts said, travel and human interaction must be reduced to a minimum.\n\nItaly moved incrementally: Officials slowly and reluctantly closed restaurants, churches and museums, and banned weddings and funerals. Nonetheless, the country's death count continues to rise.\n\nThe United States is slowly following suit. International flights are all but banned, but not domestic ones. California has ordered all residents to stay at home; New York was to shutter all nonessential businesses on Sunday evening.\n\nBut other states have fewer restrictions, and in Florida, for days spring break revelers ignored government requests to clear the beaches.\n\nOn Friday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, chief medical adviser to the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said he advocated restrictive measures all across the country.\n\nIn contrast to the halting steps taken here, China shut down Wuhan -- the epicenter of the nation's outbreak -- and restricted movement in much of the country on Jan. 23, when the country had a mere 500 cases and 17 deaths.\n\nIts rapid action had an important effect: With the virus mostly isolated in one province, the rest of China was able to save Wuhan.\n\nEven as many cities fought their own smaller outbreaks, they sent 40,000 medical workers into Wuhan, roughly doubling its medical force.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Lawmakers' disagreements threaten a sweeping federal economic stabilization package. Governors plead for masks and ventilators, but a top U.S. official says some areas will have to wait. New York State now has roughly 5 percent of the world's cases. See more updates More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nIn a vast, largely closed society, it can be difficult to know what is happening on the ground, and there is no guarantee that the virus won't roar back as the Chinese economy restarts.\n\nBut the lesson is that relatively unaffected regions of the United States will be needed to help rescue overwhelmed cities like New York and Seattle. Keeping these areas at least somewhat free of the coronavirus means enacting strict measures, and quickly.\n\nStop transmission within cities\n\nWithin cities, there are dangerous hot spots: One restaurant, one gym, one hospital, even one taxi may be more contaminated than many identical others nearby because someone had a coughing fit inside.\n\nEach day's delay in stopping human contact, experts said, creates more hot spots, none of which can be identified until about a week later, when the people infected there start falling ill.\n\nTo stop the explosion, municipal activity must be curtailed. Still, some Americans must stay on the job: doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers; police officers and firefighters; the technicians who maintain the electrical grid and gas and phone lines.\n\nThe delivery of food and medicine must continue, so that people pinned in their homes suffer nothing worse than boredom. Those essential workers may eventually need permits, and a process for issuing them, if the police are needed to enforce stay-at-home orders, as they have been in China and Italy.\n\nPeople in lockdown adapt. In Wuhan, apartment complexes submit group orders for food, medicine, diapers and other essentials. Shipments are assembled at grocery warehouses or government pantries and dropped off. In Italy, trapped neighbors serenade one another.\n\nIt's an intimidating picture. But the weaker the freeze, the more people die in overburdened hospitals -- and the longer it ultimately takes for the economy to restart.\n\nSouth Korea avoided locking down any city, but only by moving early and with extraordinary speed. In January, the country had four companies making tests, and as of March 9 had tested 210,000 citizens -- the equivalent of testing 2.3 million Americans.\n\nAs of the same date, fewer than 9,000 Americans had been tested.\n\nEveryone who is infected in South Korea goes into isolation in government shelters, and phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. Where they walked before they fell ill is broadcast to the cellphones of everyone who was nearby.\n\nAnyone even potentially exposed is quarantined at home; a GPS app tells the police if that person goes outside. The fine for doing so is $8,000.\n\nBritish researchers are trying to develop a similar tracking app, albeit one more palatable to citizens in Western democracies.\n\nFix the testing mess\n\nTesting must be done in a coordinated and safe way, experts said. The seriously ill must go first, and the testers must be protected.\n\nIn China, those seeking a test must describe their symptoms on a telemedicine website. If a nurse decides a test is warranted, they are directed to one of dozens of \"fever clinics\" set up far from all other patients.\n\nPersonnel in head-to-toe gear check their fevers and question them. Then, ideally, patients are given a rapid flu test and a white blood cell count is taken to rule out influenza and bacterial pneumonia.\n\nThen their lungs are visualized in a CT scanner to look for \"ground-glass opacities\" that indicate pneumonia and rule out cancer and tuberculosis. Only then are they given a diagnostic test for the coronavirus -- and they are told to wait at the testing center.\n\nThe results take a minimum of four hours; in the past, if results took overnight, patients were moved to a hotel to wait -- sometimes for two to three days, if doctors believed retesting was warranted. It can take several days after an exposure for a test to turn positive.\n\nIn the United States, people seeking tests are calling their doctors, who may not have them, or sometimes waiting in traffic jams leading to store parking lots. On Friday, New York City limited testing only to those patients requiring hospitalization, saying the system was being overwhelmed.\n\nIsolate the infected\n\nAs soon as possible, experts said, the United States must develop an alternative to the practice of isolating infected people at home, as it endangers families. In China, 75 to 80 percent of all transmission occurred in family clusters.\n\nThat pattern has already repeated itself here. Seven members of a large family in New Jersey were infected; four have already died. After a lawyer in New Rochelle, N.Y., fell ill, his wife, son and daughter all tested positive.\n\nInstead of a policy that advises the infected to remain at home, as the Centers for Disease and Prevention now does, experts said cities should establish facilities where the mildly and moderately ill can recuperate under the care and observation of nurses.\n\nWuhan created many such centers, called \"temporary hospitals,\" each a cross between a dormitory and a first-aid clinic. They had cots and oxygen tanks, but not the advanced machines used in intensive care units.\n\nAmerican cities now have many spaces that could serve as isolation wards. Already New York is considering turning the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into a temporary hospital, along with the Westchester Convention Center and two university campuses.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said on Saturday that state officials were also considering opening isolation wards.\n\nIn China, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, leader of the World Health Organization's observer team there, people originally resisted leaving home or seeing their children go into isolation centers with no visiting rights -- just as Americans no doubt would.\n\nIn China, they came to accept it.\n\n\"They realized they were keeping their families safe,\" he said. \"Also, isolation is really lonely. It's psychologically difficult. Here, they were all together with other people in the same boat. They supported each other.\"\n\nFind the fevers\n\nBecause China, Taiwan and Vietnam were hit by SARS in 2003, and South Korea has grappled with MERS, fever checks during disease outbreaks became routine.\n\nIn most cities in affected Asian countries, it is commonplace before entering any bus, train or subway station, office building, theater or even a restaurant to get a temperature check. Washing your hands in chlorinated water is often also required.\n\n\"They give you a sticker afterward,\" said Dr. Heymann, who recently spent a week teaching in Singapore. \"I built up quite a collection.\"\n\nIn China, having a fever means a mandatory trip to a fever clinic to check for coronavirus. In the Wuhan area, different cities took different approaches.\n\nCellphone videos from China show police officers knocking on doors and taking temperatures. In some, people who resist are dragged away by force. The city of Ningbo offered bounties of $1,400 to anyone who turned in a coronavirus sufferer.\n\nThe city of Qianjiang, by contrast, offered the same amount of money to any resident who came in voluntarily and tested positive.\n\nSome measures made Western experts queasy. It is difficult to imagine Americans permitting a family member with a fever to be dragged to an isolation ward where visitors are not permitted.\n\n\"A lot of people's rights were violated,\" Dr. Borio said.\n\nVoluntary approaches, like explaining to patients that they will be keeping family and friends safe, are more likely to work in the West, she added.\n\nTrace the contacts\n\nFinding and testing all the contacts of every positive case is essential, experts said. At the peak of its epidemic, Wuhan had 18,000 people tracking down individuals who had come in contact with the infected.\n\nAt the moment, the health departments of some American counties lack the manpower to trace even syphilis or tuberculosis, let alone scores of casual contacts of someone infected with the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Borio suggested that young Americans could use their social networks to \"do their own contact tracing.\" Social media also is used in Asia, but in different ways.\n\nChina's strategy is quite intrusive: To use the subway in some cities, citizens must download an app that rates how great a health risk they are. South Korean apps tell users exactly where infected people have traveled.\n\nWhen he lectured at a Singapore university, Dr. Heymann said, dozens of students were in the room. But just before he began class, they were photographed to record where everyone sat.\n\n\"That way, if someone turns up infected later, you can find out who sat near them,\" Dr. Heymann said. \"That's really clever.\"\n\nContacts generally must remain home for 14 days and report their temperatures twice a day.\n\nMake masks ubiquitous\n\nAmerican experts have divided opinions about masks, but those who have worked in Asia see their value.\n\nThere is very little data showing that flat surgical masks protect healthy individuals from disease. Nonetheless, Asian countries generally make it mandatory that people wear them. In China, the police even used drones to chase individuals down streets, ordering them to go home and mask up.\n\nThe Asian approach is less about data than it is about crowd psychology, experts explained.\n\nAll experts agree that the sick must wear masks to keep in their coughs. But if a mask indicates that the wearer is sick, many people will be reluctant to wear one. If everyone is required to wear masks, the sick automatically have one on and there is no stigma attached.\n\nAlso, experts emphasized, Americans should be taught to take seriously admonitions to stop shaking hands and hugging. The \"W.H.O. elbow bump\" may look funny, but it's a legitimate technique for preventing infection.\n\n\"In Asia, where they went through SARS, people understand the danger,\" Dr. Heymann said. \"It's instilled in the population that you've got to do the right thing.\"\n\nPreserve vital services\n\nFederal intervention is necessary for some vital aspects of life during a pandemic.\n\nOnly the federal government can enforce interstate commerce laws to ensure that food, water, electricity, gas, phone lines and other basic needs keep flowing across state lines to cities and suburbs.\n\nMr. Trump has said he could compel companies to prioritize making ventilators, masks and other needed goods. Some have volunteered; the Hanes underwear company, for example, will use its cotton to make masks for hospital workers.\n\nHe also has the military; the Navy is committing two hospital ships to the fight. And Mr. Trump can call up the National Guard. As of Saturday evening, more than 6,500 National Guard members already are assisting in the coronavirus response in 38 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.\n\nHigh-level decisions like these must be made quickly, experts said.\n\n\"Many Western political leaders are behaving as though they are on a tightrope,\" said Dr. David Nabarro, a W.H.O. special envoy on Covid-19 and a veteran of fights against SARS, Ebola and cholera.\n\n\"But there is no choice. We must do all in our power to fight this,\" he added. \"I sense that most people -- and certainly those in business -- get it. They would prefer to take the bitter medicine at once and contain outbreaks as they start rather than gamble with uncertainty.\"\n\nProduce ventilators and oxygen\n\nThe roughly 175,000 ventilators in all American hospitals and the national stockpile are expected to be far fewer than are needed to handle a surge of patients desperate for breath.\n\nThe machines pump air and oxygen into the lungs, but they normally cost $25,000 or more each, and neither individual hospitals nor the federal emergency stockpile has ever had enough on hand to handle the number of pneumonia patients that this pandemic is expected to produce.\n\nNew York, for example, has found about 6,000 ventilators for purchase around the world, Governor Cuomo said. He estimated the state would need about 30,000.\n\nThe manufacturers, including a dozen in the United States, say there is no easy way to ramp up production quickly. But it is possible other manufacturers, including aerospace and automobile companies, could be enlisted to do so.\n\nVentilators are basically air pumps with motors controlled by circuits that make them act like lungs: the pump pushes air into the patient, then stops so the weight of the chest can push the air back out.\n\nAutomobiles and airplanes contain many small pumps, like those for oil, water and air-conditioning fluid, that might be modified to act as basic, stripped-down ventilators. On Sunday, Mr. Trump tweeted that Ford and General Motors had been \"given the go-ahead\" to produce ventilators.\n\nProviders, meanwhile, are scrambling for alternatives.\n\nCanadian nurses are disseminating a 2006 paper describing how one ventilator can be modified to treat four patients simultaneously. Inventors have proposed combining C-PAP machines, which many apnea sufferers own, and oxygen tanks to improvise a ventilator.\n\nThe United States must also work to increase its supply of piped and tanked oxygen, Dr. Aylward said.\n\nOne of the lessons of China, he noted, was that many Covid-19 patients who would normally have been intubated and on ventilators managed to survive with oxygen alone.\n\nRetrofit hospitals\n\nHospitals in the United States have taken some measures to handle surges of patients, such as stopping elective surgery and setting up isolation rooms.\n\nTo protect bedridden long-term patients, nursing homes and hospitals also should immediately stop admitting visitors and do constant health checks on their staffs, said Dr. James LeDuc, director of the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch.\n\nThe national stockpile does contain some prepackaged military field hospitals, but they are not expected to be nearly enough for a big surge.\n\nIn Wuhan, the Chinese government famously built two new hospitals in two weeks. All other hospitals were divided: 48 were designated to handle 10,000 serious or critical coronavirus patients, while others were restricted to handling emergencies like heart attacks and births.\n\nWherever that was impractical, hospitals were divided into \"clean\" and \"dirty\" zones, and the medical teams did not cross over. Walls to isolate whole wards were built, and -- as in Ebola wards -- doctors went in one end of the room wearing protective gear and left by the other end, where they de-gowned under the eyes of a nurse to prevent infection.\n\nDecide when to close schools\n\nAs of Saturday, schools in 45 states were closed entirely, but that is a decision that divided experts.\n\n\"Closing all schools may not make sense unless there is documented widespread community transmission, which we're not seeing in most of the country,\" said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former C.D.C. director under President Barack Obama.\n\nIt is unclear how much children spread coronavirus. They very seldom get sick enough to be hospitalized, which is not true of flu. Current testing cannot tell whether most do not even become infected.\n\nIn China, Dr. Aylward said, he asked all of the doctors he spoke to whether they had seen any family clusters in which a child was the first to be infected. No one had, he said, which astonished him.\n\nThat leaves a quandary. Closing schools is a normal part of social distancing; after all, schools are the workplaces for many adults, too. And when the disease is clearly spreading within an individual school, it must close.\n\nBut closing whole school districts can seriously disrupt a city's ability to fight an outbreak. With their children stuck at home, nurses, doctors, police officers and other emergency medical workers cannot come to work.\n\nAlso, many children in low-income families depend on the meals they eat at schools.\n\nCities that close all schools are creating special \"hub schools\" for the children of essential workers. In Ohio, the governor has told school bus drivers to deliver hot meals to children who normally got them at school.\n\nRecruit volunteers\n\nChina's effort succeeded, experts said, in part because of hundreds of thousands of volunteers. The government declared a \"people's war\" and rolled out a \"Fight On, Wuhan! Fight On, China!\" campaign.\n\nIt made inspirational films that combined airline ads with 1940s-style wartime propaganda. The ads were somewhat corny, but they rallied the public.\n\nMany people idled by the lockdowns stepped up to act as fever checkers, contact tracers, hospital construction workers, food deliverers, even babysitters for the children of first responders, or as crematory workers.\n\nWith training, volunteers were able to do some ground-level but crucial medical tasks, such as basic nursing, lab technician work or making sure that hospital rooms were correctly decontaminated.\n\nAmericans often step forward to help neighbors affected by hurricanes and floods; many will no doubt do so in this outbreak, but they will need training in how not to fall ill and add to the problem.\n\n\"In my experience, success is dependent on how much the public is informed and participates,\" Admiral Ziemer said. \"This truly is an 'all hands on deck' situation.\"\n\nPrioritize the treatments\n\nClinicians in China, Italy and France have thrown virtually everything they had in hospital pharmacies into the fight, and at least two possibilities have emerged that might save patients: the anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and the antiviral remdesivir, which has no licensed use.\n\nThere is not proof yet that any of these are effective against the virus. China registered more than 200 clinical trials, including several involving those treatments, but investigators ran out of patients in critical condition to enroll. Italy and France have trials underway, and hospitals in New York are writing trial protocols now.\n\nOne worry for trial leaders is that chloroquine has been given so much publicity that patients may refuse to be \"randomized\" and accept a 50 percent chance of being given a placebo.\n\nIf any drug works on critical cases, it might be possible to use small doses as a prophylactic to prevent infection.\n\nAn alternative is to harvest protective antibodies from the blood of people who have survived the illness, said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nThe purified blood serum -- called immunoglobulin -- could possibly be used in small amounts to protect emergency medical workers, too.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the first wave won't benefit from this,\" Dr. Hotez said. \"We need to wait until we have enough survivors.\"\n\nFind a vaccine\n\nThe ultimate hope is to have a vaccine that will protect everyone, and many companies and governments have already rushed the design of candidate vaccines. But as Dr. Fauci has explained multiple times, testing those candidate vaccines for safety and effectiveness takes time.\n\nThe process will take at least a year, even if nothing goes wrong. The roadblock, vaccine experts explained, is not bureaucratic. It is that the human immune system takes weeks to produce antibodies, and some dangerous side effects can take weeks to appear.\n\nAfter extensive animal testing, vaccines are normally given to about 50 healthy human volunteers to see if they cause any unexpected side effects and to measure what dose produces enough antibodies to be considered protective.\n\nIf that goes well, the trial enrolls hundreds or thousands of volunteers in an area where the virus is circulating. Half get the vaccine, the rest do not -- and the investigators wait. If the vaccinated half do not get the disease, the green light for production is finally given.\n\nIn the past, some experimental vaccines have produced serious side effects, like Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can paralyze and kill. A greater danger, experts said, is that some experimental vaccines, paradoxically, cause \"immune enhancement,\" meaning they make it more likely, not less, that recipients will get a disease. That would be a disaster.\n\nOne candidate coronavirus vaccine Dr. Hotez invented 10 years ago in the wake of SARS, he said, had to be abandoned when it appeared to make mice more likely to die from pneumonia when they were experimentally infected with the virus.\n\nIn theory, the testing process could be sped up with \"challenge trials,\" in which healthy volunteers get the vaccine and then are deliberately infected. But that is ethically fraught when there is no cure for Covid-19. Even some healthy young people have died from this virus.\n\nReach out to other nations\n\nWealthy nations need to remember that, as much as they are struggling with the virus, poorer countries will have a far harder time and need help.\n\nAlso, the Asian nations that have contained the virus could offer expertise -- and desperately needed equipment. Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of Alibaba, recently offered large shipments of masks and testing kits to the United States.\n\nWealthy nations ignored the daily warnings from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director general, that far more aggressive efforts at isolation and contact tracing were urgently needed to stop the virus.\n\n\"Middle income and poorer nations are following the advice of international organizations while the most advanced nations find it so hard to implement it,\" Dr. Nabarro said. \"That must change.\"\n\nIn declaring the coronavirus a pandemic, Dr. Tedros called for countries to learn from one another's successes, act with unity and help protect one another against a threat to people of every nationality.\n\n\"Let's all look out

"body": "Mr. Kelly is a retired NASA astronaut who spent nearly a year on the International Space Station.\n\nBeing stuck at home can be challenging. When I lived on the International Space Station for nearly a year, it wasn't easy. When I went to sleep, I was at work. When I woke up, I was still at work. Flying in space is probably the only job you absolutely cannot quit.\n\nBut I learned some things during my time up there that I'd like to share -- because they are about to come in handy again, as we all confine ourselves at home to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Here are a few tips on living in isolation, from someone who has been there.\n\nFollow a schedule\n\nOn the space station, my time was scheduled tightly, from the moment I woke up to when I went to sleep. Sometimes this involved a spacewalk that could last up to eight hours; other times, it involved a five minute task, like checking on the experimental flowers I was growing in space. You will find maintaining a plan will help you and your family adjust to a different work and home life environment. When I returned to Earth, I missed the structure it provided and found it hard to live without.\n\nBut pace yourself\n\nWhen you are living and working in the same place for days on end, work can have a way of taking over everything if you let it. Living in space, I deliberately paced myself because I knew I was in it for the long haul -- just like we all are today. Take time for fun activities: I met up with crewmates for movie nights, complete with snacks, and binge watched all of \"Game of Thrones\" -- twice.\n\nAnd don't forget to include in your schedule a consistent bedtime. NASA scientists closely study astronauts' sleep when we are in space, and they have found that quality of sleep relates to cognition, mood, and interpersonal relations -- all essential to getting through a mission in space or a quarantine at home.\n\nGo outside\n\nOne of the things I missed most while living in space was being able to go outside and experience nature. After being confined to a small space for months, I actually started to crave nature -- the color green, the smell of fresh dirt, and the feel of warm sun on my face. That flower experiment became more important to me than I could have ever imagined. My colleagues liked to play a recording of Earth sounds, like birds and rustling trees, and even mosquitoes, over and over. It brought me back to earth. (Although occasionally I found myself swatting my ears at the mosquitoes. )\n\nFor an astronaut, going outside is a dangerous undertaking that requires days of preparation, so I appreciate that in our current predicament, I can step outside any time I want for a walk or a hike -- no spacesuit needed. Research has shown that spending time in nature is beneficial for our mental and physical health, as is exercise. You don't need to work out two and a half hours a day, as astronauts on the space station do, but getting moving once a day should be part of your quarantine schedule (just stay at least six feet away from others).\n\nYou need a hobby\n\nWhen you are confined in a small space you need an outlet that isn't work or maintaining your environment.\n\nSome people are surprised to learn I brought books with me to space. The quiet and absorption you can find in a physical book -- one that doesn't ping you with notifications or tempt you to open a new tab -- is priceless. Many small bookstores are currently offering curbside pickup or home delivery service, which means you can support a local business while also cultivating some much-needed unplugged time.\n\nYou can also practice an instrument (I just bought a digital guitar trainer online), try a craft, or make some art. Astronauts take time for all of these while in space. (Remember Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield's famous cover of David Bowie's Space Oddity?)\n\nKeep a journal\n\nNASA has been studying the effects of isolation on humans for decades, and one surprising finding they have made is the value of keeping a journal. Throughout my yearlong mission, I took the time to write about my experiences almost every day. If you find yourself just chronicling the days' events (which, under the circumstances, might get repetitive) instead try describing what you are experiencing through your five senses or write about memories. Even if you don't wind up writing a book based on your journal like I did, writing about your days will help put your experiences in perspective and let you look back later on what this unique time in history has meant.\n\nTake time to connect\n\nEven with all the responsibilities of serving as commander of a space station, I never missed the chance to have a videoconference with family and friends. Scientists have found that isolation is damaging not only to our mental health, but to our physical health as well, especially our immune systems. Technology makes it easier than ever to keep in touch, so it's worth making time to connect with someone every day -- it might actually help you fight off viruses.\n\nListen to experts\n\nI've found that most problems aren't rocket science, but when they are rocket science, you should ask a rocket scientist. Living in space taught me a lot about the importance of trusting the advice of people who knew more than I did about their subjects, whether it was science, engineering, medicine, or the design of the incredibly complex space station that was keeping me alive.\n\nEspecially in a challenging moment like the one we are living through now, we have to seek out knowledge from those who know the most about it and listen to them. Social media and other poorly vetted sources can be transmitters of misinformation just as handshakes transmit viruses, so we have to make a point of seeking out reputable sources of facts, like the World Health Organization and the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.\n\nWe are all connected\n\nSeen from space, the Earth has no borders. The spread of the coronavirus is showing us that what we share is much more powerful than what keeps us apart, for better or for worse. All people are inescapably interconnected, and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will all be.\n\nOne of the side effects of seeing Earth from a the perspective of space, at least for me, is feeling more compassion for others. As helpless as we may feel stuck inside our homes, there are always things we can do -- I've seen people reading to children via videoconference, donating their time and dollars to charities online, and running errands for elderly or immuno-compromised neighbors. The benefits for the volunteer are just as great as for those helped.\n\nI've seen humans work together to prevail over some of the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one if we all do our part and work together as a team.\n\nOh, and wash your hands -- often.\n\nScott Kelly is a retired NASA astronaut who spent nearly a year on the International Space Station.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Latina puede convertirse en la mayor v\u00edctima del COVID-19", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nR\u00cdO DE JANEIRO -- Am\u00e9rica Latina ha sido hasta ahora una de las regiones menos afectadas por el COVID-19. El primer caso fue detectado el 26 de febrero en Brasil, la primera muerte, el 7 de marzo en Argentina.\n\nLa pandemia ha tardado en llegar a la regi\u00f3n, pero esta semana el Ministerio de la Sanidad brasile\u00f1o ha anunciado el inicio de la fase de transmisi\u00f3n comunitaria del virus, que consiste en el contagio local entre personas que no han viajado a zonas de riesgo en el extranjero ni han estado en contacto con personas provenientes de esas zonas. Esto significa que el simple aislamiento de la regi\u00f3n y de los infectados no ser\u00e1 suficiente: los casos de COVID-19 crecer\u00e1n en Am\u00e9rica Latina.\n\nEs preocupante porque la regi\u00f3n no est\u00e1 preparada para la propagaci\u00f3n del virus y se puede esperar un escenario a\u00fan m\u00e1s complejo que el europeo -- donde se han registrado m\u00e1s de 4000 muertes y m\u00e1s de 80.000 casos -- e incluso volverse la mayor v\u00edctima del COVID-19, si las autoridades sanitarias y los gobiernos de nuestros pa\u00edses no adoptan acciones inmediatas para fortalecer sus sistemas de salud. Combatir una pandemia que afectar\u00e1 a una parte significativa de la poblaci\u00f3n no solo es cuesti\u00f3n de inversi\u00f3n sino de un agresivo y eficaz redireccionamiento de los recursos existentes para disminuir sus efectos.\n\nA diferencia de Estados Unidos, gran parte de los pa\u00edses latinoamericanos tiene la salud como un derecho social garantizado por la constituci\u00f3n, tal es el caso de M\u00e9xico y Per\u00fa. Las constituciones brasile\u00f1a y venezolana van m\u00e1s all\u00e1 y la establecen como \"derecho de todos y un deber del Estado\". Sin embargo, cuando vemos la proporci\u00f3n de recursos que esos pa\u00edses asignan a la salud p\u00fablica, nos damos cuenta de cu\u00e1n lejos est\u00e1n de otros pa\u00edses que se proponen tambi\u00e9n proveer salud para todos.\n\nDe acuerdo con un estudio del Instituto de Estudos para Pol\u00edticas de Sa\u00fade (IEPS) -- un centro de investigaci\u00f3n independiente enfocado en la creaci\u00f3n de pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas de salud en Brasil -- , M\u00e9xico destina el 3 por ciento de su PIB a la salud p\u00fablica y Venezuela, el 1,7 por ciento, mientras que el promedio en los pa\u00edses de la Organizaci\u00f3n para la Cooperaci\u00f3n y el Desarrollo Econ\u00f3micos (OCDE) es de 6,6 por ciento. Italia, por ejemplo, el escenario m\u00e1s terror\u00edfico del coronavirus en estos d\u00edas, destina el 6,7 por ciento de su PIB a la salud p\u00fablica. Si se toma en cuenta la inversi\u00f3n total en salud (p\u00fablica y privada) por habitante, vemos que la regi\u00f3n es una de las que menos invierte en salud: 949 d\u00f3lares per c\u00e1pita, casi cuatro veces menos que los pa\u00edses miembros de la OCDE e incluso menos que el promedio de los pa\u00edses de Medio Oriente y el norte de \u00c1frica.\n\nLa clara limitaci\u00f3n de la oferta de estos servicios se agrava por el hecho de que Am\u00e9rica Latina presenta un panorama epidemiol\u00f3gico -- es decir, las principales causas de morbilidad y mortalidad de una poblaci\u00f3n -- m\u00e1s complejo que otras partes del mundo. En la regi\u00f3n se combina la prevalencia de enfermedades no transmisibles -- caracter\u00edstica de pa\u00edses desarrollados -- con enfermedades infecciosas de pa\u00edses pobres. Los sistemas de salud latinoamericanos tratan tipos de enfermedades totalmente diversos -- de la hipertensi\u00f3n y la diabetes al dengue y el zika -- y que requieren acciones de salud muy distintas.\n\nA eso se suma una otra especificidad de Am\u00e9rica Latina que pesa en el sistema de salud: las victimas de violencia. En esa regi\u00f3n, donde vive solo el 8 por ciento de la poblaci\u00f3n mundial, se registra el 33 por ciento de los homicidios de todo el mundo. Un cuarto de todos los asesinatos del mundo se producen en M\u00e9xico, Venezuela, Brasil y Colombia.\n\nTomando en cuenta ese contexto, \u00bfc\u00f3mo podr\u00e1n los pa\u00edses de la regi\u00f3n hacerle frente al coronavirus?\n\nUn estudio reciente del IEPS proyecta que solo los costos con unidades de cuidados intensivos (UCI) de pacientes de COVID-19 pueden llegar a consumir el equivalente al gasto total del gobierno brasile\u00f1o en hospitalizaciones en 2019. Seg\u00fan el estudio, con cada punto porcentual de la poblaci\u00f3n infectada de esta nueva cepa de coronavirus habr\u00e1 que gastarse 1 bill\u00f3n de reales (equivalente a 250 millones de d\u00f3lares) en hospitalizaci\u00f3n. Si un 20 por ciento de la poblaci\u00f3n se infecta, el costo de hospitalizaci\u00f3n de estos pacientes ser\u00eda equivalente al 98 por ciento del costo total de producci\u00f3n hospitalaria cubierto por el gobierno en todo 2019. Brasil tendr\u00eda por lo tanto que doblar su capacidad de UCI o redireccionar todos los recursos de UCI solo para atender a los pacientes de COVID-19.\n\nPero es poco realista esperar que Am\u00e9rica Latina invierta m\u00e1s en los sistemas de salud. Incluso antes del brote del virus, las proyecciones indicaban un crecimiento econ\u00f3mico muy bajo para la regi\u00f3n en los pr\u00f3ximos dos a\u00f1os. Esto hace poco probable que se invierta m\u00e1s en salud, y en especial en salud p\u00fablica. Lo m\u00e1s seguro es que veamos un redireccionamiento de la oferta de salud para enfrentar la nueva emergencia sanitaria. Eso significa que los gobiernos movilizar\u00e1n recursos financieros o asistenciales suplementarios solo para tratar a los pacientes de COVID-19 y podr\u00edan dejar sin esos recursos a otros pacientes. Tal situaci\u00f3n puede agravarse si a ella se superponen brotes de otras enfermedades infecciosas. En 2019, se registraron 1501 muertes por el dengue en la regi\u00f3n, un r\u00e9cord hist\u00f3rico.\n\nSi una parte significativa de la poblaci\u00f3n es infectada, los sistemas de salud tendr\u00e1n que elegir entre atender a las v\u00edctimas del COVID-19 o a los portadores de todas las otras enfermedades. Tal escenario es dram\u00e1tico y convertir\u00eda a Am\u00e9rica Latina en la mayor v\u00edctima del coronavirus.\n\nPara evitarlo es esencial que los gobiernos nacionales tomen dos importantes decisiones. En primer lugar, la m\u00e1s urgente, que inviertan masivamente en medidas de contenci\u00f3n de la propagaci\u00f3n de la epidemia, creando todos los incentivos posibles para que los ciudadanos eviten la circulaci\u00f3n. En segundo lugar, y a largo plazo, que inviertan m\u00e1s y mejor en sus sistemas de salud para garantizar el acceso de todos los ciudadanos a la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica y asegurar que la regi\u00f3n no est\u00e9 tan desprotegida ante nuevas epidemias.\n\nMiguel Lago es polit\u00f3logo, director ejecutivo del Instituto de Estudos para Pol\u00edticas de Sa\u00fade (IEPS), un centro de

Some People Can't Wash Their Kids for a Week.'", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nMAARAT MISRIN, Syria -- In northwestern Syria, where a million people who have fled the civil war are sheltering in muddy tent camps and abandoned buildings, the spread of the coronavirus could wreak untold disaster on a devastated region.\n\nForget hand washing and social distancing, the preventive measures recommended by health authorities around the world.\n\nThere is little to no running water in the camps, and up to a dozen people often live in the same tent.\n\n\"You want us to wash our hands?\" asked Fadi Mesaher, the Idlib director for the Maram Foundation for Relief and Development. \"Some people can't wash their kids for a week. They are living outdoors.\"\n\nSyrian doctors believe the virus has already swept into the camps, with deaths and illness that bear the hallmarks of the outbreak. But the international response has been slow to nonexistent, according to more than a dozen experts and Syrian medical professionals.\n\nThe World Health Organization has not yet delivered coronavirus testing kits to the opposition-held northwest, despite making its first delivery of such kits to the Syrian government more than a month ago.\n\nDoctors said the delay has probably allowed the virus to spread undetected for weeks in a uniquely dangerous environment.\n\n\"We currently have cases that are similar, and we've had people die,\" said Dr. Mohamed Ghaleb Tennari, who manages the Syrian American Medical Society's hospitals in the region. \"But unfortunately because we don't have the test, we can't confirm that these cases are truly corona or not.\"\n\nAbout three million people are crowded into Idlib Province, which has been outside the control of President Bashar al-Assad's government since 2012 and is the country's last rebel-held pocket.\n\nMr. Assad's forces and their Russian allies began a final push to retake the area last spring, and a renewed offensive in early December drove nearly a million people from their homes.\n\nAbout a third of them are living in large camps or tents, the United Nations estimates. The rest are sleeping along roadsides, squatting in unfinished or abandoned buildings, or sharing quarters with other families.\n\nA cease-fire has held for two weeks but no one expects it to last. Mr. Assad has vowed to continue the offensive and rebel groups in the province have vowed to resist.\n\nAcross the province, hospitals and medical facilities have been decimated by eight years of war. Syrian government and Russian warplanes have repeatedly bombed and shelled hospitals and clinics in opposition-held areas throughout the conflict, killing hundreds of health care workers.\n\nSince the December offensive began, more than 84 hospitals and medical facilities in the northwest have been damaged, destroyed or forced to close, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThose that are still running lack the needed supplies.\n\nIn Idlib City, a lab at Idlib Central Hospital is ready to test for coronavirus but lacks the test kits, said Dr. Naser Almhawish, the surveillance coordinator for the Early Warning Alert and Response Network of the Assistance Coordination Unit, an independent group.\n\nSyrian doctors have asked for more protective equipment, like masks and gloves, but the first new shipment from the World Health Organization arrived only Tuesday.\n\nWhen we visited Idlib Province after crossing from Turkey last week, we saw no screening points for the virus.\n\nInformal encampments lined the road from the border to Maarat Misrin, a small town planted in agricultural fields and on windy hillsides. In the town hospital, bleary-eyed doctors worked in basement operating rooms, while a crowd of people waited above.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we don't have areas of quarantine available in north Syria,\" said Abd al-Razzaq Zaqzouq, a media assistant for the Syrian American Medical Society at the hospital. \"If there is any case of corona in north Syria, the situation will be tragic.\"\n\nDoctors in the region estimate that a million people in Idlib Province could contract the virus, that 100,000 to 120,000 could die, and that 10,000 will need the help of ventilators. There are 153 ventilators in the province now.\n\n\"You may have seen countries like Italy and China -- countries that have a quarantine system, and even they couldn't handle the pressure of all of these cases,\" said Dr. Tennari. \"Imagine then -- we're in a state of war and we don't have a proper health care system. It's crippled.\"\n\nHedinn Halldorrson, a spokesman for the World Health Organization's cross-border efforts in southern Turkey, said Wednesday that the W.H.O. expects test kits to arrive in Idlib next week. He said he did not know how many kits would be sent or exactly when they would arrive. Samples can be sent to labs in Turkey in the meantime, he said.\n\nThe delay, he said, was because the W.H.O. distributed kits to government health agencies first. \"The northwest is not a country,\" he said.\n\nGiven the obstacles to delivering supplies to a conflict zone, Mr. Halldorrson said, a month's delay was not bad.\n\n\"When you consider the challenges, I think it's quite reasonable,\" he said. \"I don't know the nitty-gritty details of it, but they will be there soon, that's all I know.\"\n\nHe also said that border screening checkpoints would be set up soon and that more protective equipment would be delivered, although he did not know when or how much.\n\nOn Sunday, the Idlib Health Directorate, an opposition body, said that there was a \"high possibility for a pandemic outbreak to spread in the liberated areas in the very near future, if it isn't here already.\"\n\nIt issued recommendations, including closing the schools and universities that remain open, closing cafes and restaurants except for takeout, halting group prayers, social visits and unnecessary travel, and advice on how to sneeze and cough, wash hands and clean living spaces.\n\nBut most of those recommendations are impossible in the tent camps.\n\n\"If there is an elder or anyone being sick, I don't see how they will separate themselves,\" said Michel Olivier Lacharit\u00e9, a crisis coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.\n\nAt the Atmeh camp, pressed against the Turkish border 30 miles north of Idlib City, sewage runs openly in the roads and there is no regular garbage pick up.\n\nAmina Alkaeed, who lives there with her husband, parents and 10-month-old daughter, said that her husband had built a bathroom for their small house, but that nearby, up to 40 people use five toilets with no place to wash their hands.\n\nWomen congregate every day to fill water jugs from a tank and pick up bread.\n\n\"And that bread is wrapped in a bag,\" she said. \"That bag could be carrying the virus. Then the virus will be transferred to these people.\"\n\nThe camp clinic is small, crowded and overburdened. Relief workers who have come to educate camp residents have not worn masks or gloves or sanitized their hands, she said.\n\n\"This virus can kill more people in one month here in northern Syria than the regime killed in the last 10 years,\" she said.\n\nThese conditions will make transmission of the virus significantly easier, experts said. And with hospitals and clinics already stressed by years of conflict, the fatality rate is likely to be much higher than that in better-equipped countries, Mr. Lacharit\u00e9 said.\n\nIdlib is under the effective control of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist organization that split from Al Qaeda in 2017 and has used violence against civil society activists, though it has recently made efforts to improve its image.\n\nThe group has not issued any statements about preparing for the coronavirus.\n\nThis week, the Syrian relief group Violet held training sessions for about 40 nurses and ambulance drivers who will be on the front line of Idlib's response.\n\nViolet plans to organize them into two teams: those who will deliver advice and baskets with soap, brochures and hand sanitizer, and those who transport people suspected of having the virus. But a global run on sanitizer has left Violet unable to buy much, said Fouad Issa, Violet's founder.\n\nIf, as expected, the cases start expanding exponentially, they will be quickly overwhelmed.\n\nRelief and medical workers fear that even when test kits and protective gear do finally arrive, they may be too little too late.\n\n\"If God forbid corona enters our area,\" said Mr. Mesaher of the Maram Foundation, \"then it will be the greatest tragedy.\"\n\nVivian Yee contributed reporting from Beirut.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

Sorry for the Airlines", "body": "Mr. Wu is the author of \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age.\"\n\nFor American Airlines, the nation's largest airline, the mid to late 2010s were what the Bible calls \"years of plenty.\"\n\nIn 2014, having reduced competition through mergers and raised billions of dollars in new baggage-fee revenue, American began reaching stunning levels of financial success. In 2015, it posted a $7.6 billion profit -- compared, for example, to profits of about $500 million in 2007 and less than $250 million in 2006. It would continue to earn billions in profit annually for the rest of the decade. \"I don't think we're ever going to lose money again,\" the company's chief executive, Doug Parker, said in 2017.\n\nThere are plenty of things American could have done with all that money. It could have stored up its cash reserves for a future crisis, knowing that airlines regularly cycle through booms and busts. It might have tried to decisively settle its continuing contract disputes with pilots, flight attendants and mechanics. It might have invested heavily in better service quality to try to repair its longstanding reputation as the worst of the major carriers.\n\nInstead, American blew most of its cash on a stock buyback spree. From 2014 to 2020, in an attempt to increase its earnings per share, American spent more than $15 billion buying back its own stock. It managed, despite the risk of the proverbial rainy day, to shrink its cash reserves. At the same time it was blowing cash on buybacks, American also began to borrow heavily to finance the purchase of new planes and the retrofitting of old planes to pack in more seats. As early as 2017 analysts warned of a risk of default should the economy deteriorate, but American kept borrowing. It has now accumulated a debt of nearly $30 billion, nearly five times the company's current market value.\n\nAt no time during its years of plenty did American improve how it treats its customers. Change fees went up to $200 for domestic flights and to $750 for international. Its widely despised baggage fees were hiked to $30 and $40 for first and second bags. These higher fees yielded billions of dollars, yet did not help the airline improve its on-time arrivals, reduce tarmac delays or prevent involuntary bumping. Instead, American's main \"innovations\" were the removal of screens from its planes, the reduction of bathroom and seat sizes and the introduction of a \"basic economy\" class that initially included a ban on carry-on luggage.\n\nIn the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which is wreaking havoc on the airline industry, American Airlines has not yet asked for a bailout -- at least not in so many words. Yet after a recent meeting with airline leadership, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said that \"certain sectors of the economy, airlines coming to mind\" might require assistance. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that the airlines, including American, would be \"on the top of the list\" for federal loan relief.\n\nAs the government considers what we, the public, should do for the airlines, we should ask, Just what have they done for us?\n\nThe United States economy needs an airline industry to function. The industry is in that sense not a \"normal\" industry, but rather what was once called a common carrier or a public utility: a critical infrastructure on which the rest of the economy relies. The major airlines know that unlike a local restaurant, they will never be allowed, collectively, to fail completely. In practice, the public has subsidized the industry by providing de facto insurance against hard times in the form of bailouts or merger approvals. And now here we go again.\n\nWe cannot permit American and other airlines to use federal assistance, whether labeled a bailout or not, to weather the coronavirus crisis and then return to business as usual. Before providing any loan relief, tax breaks or cash transfers, we must demand that the airlines change how they treat their customers and employees and make basic changes in industry ownership structure.\n\nBeginning with passengers, change fees should be capped at $50 and baggage fees tied to some ratio of costs. The change fees don't just irritate; they are also a drag on the broader economy, making the transport system less flexible and discouraging what would otherwise be efficient changes to travel plans. We should also put an end to the airlines' pursuit of smaller and smaller seats, which are not only uncomfortable and even physically harmful, but also foster in-flight rage and make the job of flight attendants nigh unbearable. Finally, we have allowed too much common ownership, permitting large shareholders to take a stake in each of the major airlines, creating incentives to collude instead of compete.\n\nThe airlines will argue that their ownership structure, cramped seats, high fees and other forms of customer suffering are necessary to keep prices lower. But after the last decade's mergers, no one should take that argument seriously. As any economist will tell you, in a market with reduced competition, and common ownership, there is limited pressure to reduce prices. Instead, as we've seen, the major airlines charge what they can get away with and spend the profit on stock buybacks and other self-serving enterprises.\n\nThe question of what the public should demand from an airline bailout raises questions that transcend the business of flying. The next several weeks will leave behind many economic victims, including nearly every provider of in-person services. Many small retailers, restaurants and other businesses, like caterers or fitness instructors, face grim prospects. Yet it is the economy's big players, like banks and airlines, that are the best at asking for (and getting) government assistance.\n\nDuring the last economic crisis, we largely let individuals suffer while helping out the big guys, leaving behind deep resentments that still fester. This time around we should start from the bottom instead of the top.\n\nTim Wu (@superwuster) is a law professor at Columbia, a contributing opinion writer and the author, most recently, of \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age.\"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

At a Los Angeles emergency room, doctors were given a box of expired masks, and when they tried to put them on, the elastic bands snapped.\n\nWith coronavirus cases soaring, doctors, nurses and other front-line medical workers across the United States are confronting a dire shortage of masks, surgical gowns and eye gear to protect them from the virus.\n\nIn interviews, doctors said they were increasingly anxious, fearing they could expose not only themselves to the virus, but their families and others.\n\n\"There's absolutely no way to protect myself,\" said Dr. Faezah A. Bux, an anesthesiologist in central Kentucky who in recent days had to intubate several elderly patients in respiratory distress without the respirator masks and protective eye gear recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Not only can I not protect myself, I can't protect my patients.\"\n\nAt a White House briefing on Thursday, President Trump said millions of masks were in production and that the federal government had made efforts to address the shortages, though he did not provide details. But he said it was largely up to governors to deal with the problem.\n\n\"The federal government's not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You know, we're not a shipping clerk.\"\n\nWhile doctors grappled with supply problems, the State Department advised Americans who are abroad to either come home now or plan to stay overseas until the pandemic is under control. In Italy, the death toll is now more than 3,400, a higher number of fatalities than even in China.\n\nIn the United States, the number of reported cases grew to more than 11,000 on Thursday, as Senate Republicans released a plan that would provide checks of up to $1,200 for many taxpayers and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California issued an order that state residents \"stay at home.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak As worldwide toll nears 10,000, medical workers issue urgent pleas for assistance.

Two emergency room doctors in New Jersey and Washington have been hospitalized in critical condition, dozens of other health care workers across the country have already fallen ill and hundreds have been forced into quarantine.\n\n\"We are at war with no ammo,\" said a surgeon in Fresno, Calif., who said she had no access to even the most basic surgical masks in her outpatient clinic and has a limited supply of the tight-fitting respirator masks in the operating room. Like many doctors interviewed, she asked not to be quoted by name, worried about retribution from administrators for speaking out.\n\nFederal health officials say respirator masks can be used for eight hours of continuous or intermittent use and should be discarded after treating an infected patient. Many doctors around the country said they are being given just one, to use indefinitely, and they spray it down with Lysol or wipe it off, not knowing whether that will help preserve it.\n\nMany doctors and nurses say their fears and frustrations have been compounded by guidance from the C.D.C. that they consider unclear and misleading. Recently it changed its guidance to say that regular surgical masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the special N95 respirator masks. They get their name because they can filter out 95 percent of all airborne particles when used correctly.\n\nThe agency says that such masks remain essential for doctors during intubations, which involve inserting a breathing tube down a patient's throat. It is a procedure that can more easily spread disease.\n\nWhile some infectious disease doctors defend the guidelines -- noting that surgical masks and protective eyewear are sufficient for everyday patient exchanges -- others argue the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science. The American Nurses Association said the guidelines were creating confusion among its members over how to stay safe.\n\n\"We are concerned that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,\" the association said in a letter to Congress. \"It's also concerning that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.\"\n\nIn an email, the agency acknowledged the shortages, but did not respond to questions about doctors' concerns over its guidance.\n\nHoward K. Mell, a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, said the crisis requires decisive federal action. He urged the White House to ramp up production of medical gear through the Defense Production Act powers, and he called on federal authorities to increase distributions from the Strategic National Stockpile, a repository of critical medical supplies for public health emergencies.\n\nThe stockpile has roughly 12 million N95 masks and 30 million surgical masks. The Department of Heath and Human Services, which oversees the stockpile, did not return emails requesting information about the supplies. The department has estimated that the country would need 3.5 billion masks in the event of a pandemic lasting a year.\n\nA cache of several thousand face masks and other gear from the stockpile recently arrived in Oregon and Washington. Officials in both states said it was far less than what they had requested.\n\n\"If this is a wartime situation, then now is the time to act,\" said Dr. Mell, who is an emergency room doctor in Illinois.\n\nIn recent days, Dr. Mell said he felt helpless as he fielded desperate calls from emergency room doctors across the country. On Tuesday, he was surprised to find 10 boxes of respirator masks typically used by construction workers at a local Target store. With certain construction masks temporarily approved for medical use by the F.D.A., he bought the entire supply and is sending half of them to a doctor in the Bronx whose hospital has completely run out.\n\n\"Why on God's green earth can I go to Target and buy these items when so many hospitals are running out?\" he asked. \"If they are available at Target, there are certainly more sitting at a distribution center somewhere. We need these in our hospitals right now.\"\n\nSeveral large hospital chains said they had adequate supplies for now, though they have taken steps to ration their use. The George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., has told heath care workers they can use a respirator mask five times before discarding it, and it is keeping its supply of masks under lock and key.\n\n\"We've experienced outright theft, with the general public walking into our building and walking right out,\" said Bruno Petinaux, the hospital's chief medical officer.\n\nSmaller hospitals and nonprofit clinics, especially those that lack centralized supply operations, are moving aggressively to conserve their gear. In an effort to save precious supplies, Chatham Hospital in Siler City, N.C., is only allowing one doctor and one nurse to examine patients with symptoms of respiratory distress.\n\nSome hospitals are employing more heavy-handed tactics. Saint Peter's Healthcare System in New Jersey on Wednesday warned doctors in an email they could be disciplined for wearing masks when not examining patients.\n\nOn Thursday, volunteers with knives, rulers and masking tape gathered at the headquarters of Providence St. Joseph Health to cobble together face shields for the system's thousands of caregivers. In Oregon, health officials in Multnomah County are calling on the public to donate any rubber gloves, goggles or face masks they might have at home or work. The county, which includes Portland, has little more than a week before critical supplies run out.\n\n\"Every pandemic is local so you have to pull on those local strings so we can help each other,\" said Julie Sullivan-Springhetti, a health department spokesperson.\n\nBut with limited prospects for speedy government intervention, fear and anxiety continue to mount. In recent days, hundreds of medical workers have taken to social media with public pleas for help using the hashtag #GetMePPE. (P.P.E. stands for personal protective equipment.)\n\nA doctor at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis described how she and her colleagues intubated a trauma patient they later discovered was likely infected with Covid-19. All of them wore simple face masks as they worked just inches from the patient's face.\n\n\"I'm terrified,\" she said, her voice cracking with emotion as she ended her shift. \"I feel like it's only a matter of time before I'm infected with this illness.\"\n\nSheri Fink, Karen Weise and Sharon LaFraniere contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

the packages keep arriving: food, medicine, clothes, toys and a million other items brought to the doorsteps and building lobbies of Americans who are hunkering down as the coronavirus sweeps the land.\n\nAn increasing number of the workers sorting those boxes, loading them into trucks and then transporting and delivering them around the country have fallen sick.\n\nThey have coughs, sore throats, aches and fevers -- symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. Yet they are still reporting for their shifts in crowded shipping facilities and warehouses and truck depots, fearful of what will happen if they don't.\n\n\"I have been coming in sick because I'm worried that I'll lose my job or just be punished if I call out,\" said Angel Duarte, a package handler at a UPS hub in Tucson, Ariz. \"I am 23, and I have no savings, and I have a 4-month-old son.\"\n\nUPS, FedEx and XPO Logistics are three of the largest shipping and logistics companies in an industry that collectively delivers about 18 trillion dollars' worth of goods every year. With millions of Americans now on lockdown, home-delivery orders have soared, and the companies have become among the few power sources keeping the lights on in the darkening United States economy. UPS, for example, is one of the main companies that deliver packages for Amazon.\n\nPublic health experts said the odds were relatively low that ill warehouse workers or truck drivers would infect the recipients of packages, in part because the virus does not survive on cardboard surfaces for very long.\n\nBut as state governments race to contain the fast-spreading pandemic by shutting down businesses and banning gatherings of more than a handful of people, more than 30 employees of UPS, FedEx and XPO said in interviews and emails that they were worried that their warehouses and trucks had become breeding grounds for the virus.\n\nSome warehouse workers said supervisors had rebuffed them when they pleaded for bleach, masks, gloves and a ready supply of hand sanitizer. In some facilities, even hand soap and paper towels are scarce, employees said. Employees continue to be jammed shoulder to shoulder along conveyor belts and required to maintain rituals such as security pat-downs.\n\nMany workers in the logistics and delivery industry get at most a handful of paid sick days a year. That can push them to work through coughs and fevers. Now, with so many people and businesses relying on a functioning delivery system, the pressure to go in has only intensified, workers said.\n\nLatest Updates: Markets Starbucks will close its cafes across the United States. Boeing says its chief executive and chairman will forgo their pay. As the economic crisis mounts, hedge funds look to still make money. See more updates More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nA package sorter in UPS's Santa Rosa, Calif., facility, said she had been going into work every day, even though her \"throat feels like broken glass.\" The worker, who requested anonymity, said she was petrified that she would lose her job if she called in sick. \"I can't afford to be homeless,\" she said.\n\nAnother UPS package handler, Jeff Donigian, who works in Manchester, N.H., said he had been showing up to work feeling ill and coughing. He told a supervisor; he was told to go in anyway.\n\nA UPS driver with a compromised immune system said she had been hauling packages around Northern California despite feeling sick for a week. With an avalanche of orders, her supervisor told her that UPS could not afford to lose her, even for a couple of days.\n\n\"While it is possible to find an exception, our work force has been provided information and supplies to manage health risks,\" said Steve Gaut, a UPS spokesman.\n\nHe said that the company had \"substantially increased cleaning and disinfecting surfaces throughout our facilities,\" and that the vehicles and equipment were disinfected every day. Masks are being made available to drivers who made deliveries to health care and assisted-living facilities, and the company is \"distributing an additional 250,000 bottles of hand sanitizer.\"\n\nMr. Gaut declined to comment on the experiences of the drivers or workers handling packages, but emphasized that UPS did not want sick employees to go into work, adding that the company provides paid time off for those who are infected.\n\nAt XPO, which handles shipping for companies like Disney, Nike and Verizon and has a large fleet of trucks that haul goods nationwide, warehouse workers and truck drivers do not get any paid sick days. The company, which has faced intense criticism from employees about dangerous work conditions in its warehouses, offers to \"lend\" workers up to 100 hours of time off, but employees have to repay that time.\n\nAn XPO warehouse worker and a driver said in interviews that as a result of the company's policy on sick leave, they had been go into work with coughs and worse.\n\n\"The company is shifting the financial burden on the people who can least afford it,\" said Mike Zangrillo, a 67-year-old driver for XPO in Miami. If he gets the coronavirus, he said, he plans to keep driving his eighteen-wheeler.\n\nBob Josephson, an XPO spokesman, said the company had started offering paid time off for workers to be tested for the coronavirus and, if necessary, quarantined. \"As the situation evolves, we're listening to our employees' concerns and adjusting our policies in real time,\" he said.\n\nDan Baker, a part-time package handler for FedEx in Nashville, worked through a sore throat and stomach problems this month. When he developed a fever, he told his supervisor he needed a day off.\n\n\"I really need you here today,\" Mr. Baker's supervisor told him in a text message reviewed by The New York Times. He took the day off anyway. The company marked his absence as unexcused, meaning he got a demerit. Too many demerits can get a worker fired.\n\n\"I went to human resources to ask about it, like, 'Why was I given an unexcused absence, why'd I get in trouble for this, when there's a pandemic going on?'\" Mr. Baker said. \"And they were like, 'I don't know what to tell you.'\"\n\nMr. Baker described a macho culture at his warehouse, where people have not been taking the virus seriously. One colleague who wore a mask was teased so relentlessly that he took it off. Mr. Baker overheard another colleague telling a security guard that his mother had tested positive but that he had to gone to work anyway.\n\n\"It's not going to do these people who are ordering and hoarding this stuff any good if everyone handling the packages are sick,\" he said.\n\nJenny Robertson, a FedEx spokeswoman, said the company had been urging employees \"to take any signs of illness seriously and seek medical attention as needed.\" She said that the company had been frequently disinfecting facilities and vehicles and that it had recently increased paid sick leave available to some employees.\n\nMs. Robertson arranged for The Times to speak with a driver in Garden City, N.Y., who said FedEx had provided him with gloves, hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes for his truck. The driver, Raymond Wenz, said he had nine days of personal and sick days to use if he fell ill. He said he was confident that, if needed, he could use his three weeks of vacation, which must normally be scheduled in advance.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure that if I'm in a bind, they would work with you,\" Mr. Wenz said.\n\nTruck drivers for UPS, FedEx and XPO said they were grateful for a recent change: Customers no longer need to sign for deliveries. That means no shared pens and no need to get within six feet of customers.\n\nThe drivers described operating in what felt like a world hollowed out by sickness. On Facebook, they swap photos wearing gas masks. Regular customers will not let the drivers use bathrooms. It can be hard for them to find places to wash their hands along the routes, especially as more and more businesses close.\n\nNick Perry, a 32-year-old UPS driver in Columbus, Ohio, said his supervisors had told him that he could not have Lysol wipes or hand sanitizer in his truck without paperwork listing the ingredients, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Mr. Perry said he feared for his twin boys, who have a history of serious respiratory problems.\n\n\"I didn't think I'd be on the front line of the pandemic,\" he said. \"But here I am, and I am terrified for the public's health, and for my parents and for my family.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio urged businesses to take the temperatures of all employees before they entered workplaces and to be \"aggressive in regard to cleaning surfaces and having soap/hand sanitizer available.\"\n\nMr. Perry said a manager had told him that the governor's directive was not a \"mandate\" and that UPS's Columbus trucking facility did not have the necessary resources to comply.\n\nSome UPS workers created a petition to push the company to better sanitize common areas and give employees 14 days of paid time off if they needed to be in quarantine after exposure to the coronavirus. In about 24 hours, more than 10,000 workers signed the petition, according to David Levin, an organizer with Teamsters for a Democratic Union, which helped coordinate the petition.\n\nOn Wednesday, UPS agreed to give people 10 paid days to stay home if they or their members of their immediate family received a coronavirus diagnosis or if they needed to quarantine themselves.\n\nBut Fen Davidson, who identifies as nonbinary and works at the same UPS hub in Tucson as Mr. Duarte, said there was still pressure to come in.\n\nThis week, Mx. Davidson said, a supervisor told them that taking too many sick days could cost them their job. \"They don't want people faking sick, I guess, but what they are doing is creating a climate of fear,\" said Mx. Davidson, 33.\n\nOne of the workers nearby on the conveyor belt line has been complaining of body aches.\n\n\"He has been coughing all week,\" Mx. Davidson said. \"But he can't afford to lose this job.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_abrams@nytimes.com", "name":

Outbreak\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- President Trump has sent a letter to North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, expressing his willingness to help the North battle the coronavirus, North Korea said on Sunday.\n\n\"I would like to extend sincere gratitude to the U.S. president for sending his invariable faith to the Chairman,\" said Kim Yo-jong, the North Korean leader's sister and policy aide, in a statement carried by the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. Ms. Kim lauded Mr. Trump's decision to write the letter as \"a good judgment and proper action.\"\n\nIn the letter, Mr. Trump \"wished the family of the Chairman and our people well-being,\" Ms. Kim said, referring to his brother by one of his official titles.\n\nAccording to Ms. Kim, Mr. Trump also explained his plan to move relations between the two countries forward and \"expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work, saying that he was impressed by the efforts made by the Chairman to defend his people from the serious threat of the epidemic.\"\n\nThe White House confirmed that Mr. Trump had sent Mr. Kim a letter but did not comment on its specifics.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. Kim have repeatedly touted their unusual relationship. They exchanged a number of personal letters before and after their first summit in Singapore in 2018, and at one point Mr. Trump said he and Mr. Kim had fallen \"in love.\"\n\nBut relations between Pyongyang and Washington have cooled since the leaders' second summit meeting, held in Vietnam in February of last year, collapsed over differences regarding how quickly North Korea should dismantle its nuclear weapons program and when Washington should ease sanctions.\n\nSince then, Mr. Kim has repeatedly said that North Korea was no longer interested in diplomacy with the United States unless it changed what he called its hostile policy, including sanctions. He also warned that the North no longer felt bound by its self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Kim attended the testing of two short-range ballistic missiles by his military.\n\nMs. Kim said on Sunday that her brother had \"mentioned his special personal relations with President Trump again and appreciated the personal letter.\" But she said good personal relations between the two leaders were not enough to improve their countries' ties.\n\n\"We try to hope for the day when the relations between the two countries would be as good as the ones between the two top leaders, but it has to be left to time and be watched whether it can actually happen,\" she said. \"However, we will never lose or waste time for nothing, but will keep changing ourselves to be more powerful for that time just as how we made ourselves for the past two years.\"\n\nA senior Trump administration official, who insisted on anonymity, said the president's letter was consistent with his efforts to engage world leaders during the coronavirus pandemic. The official said Mr. Trump looked forward to continued communications with Mr. Kim.\n\nNorth Korea is highly vulnerable to epidemics because of the decrepit state of its public health system and the international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, which make it hard to ship aid there.\n\nOfficially, the North has reported no coronavirus cases, although it says it is waging an all-out campaign against the virus.  Outside health experts fear that the isolated country might be hiding an outbreak.\n\nKatie Rogers contributed reporting from Washington.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Outbreak\n\nROME -- At around midnight on Wednesday, Renzo Carlo Testa, 85, died from the coronavirus in a hospital in the northern Italian town of Bergamo. Five days later, his body was still sitting in a coffin, one of scores lined head-to-toe in the church of the local cemetery, which is itself closed to the public.\n\nHis wife of 50 years, Franca Stefanelli, would like to give him a proper funeral. But traditional funeral services are illegal throughout Italy now, part of the national restrictions against gatherings and going out that have been put in place to try to stem the spread of Europe's worst outbreak of the coronavirus. In any case, she and her sons could not attend anyway, because they are themselves sick and in quarantine.\n\n\"It's a strange thing,\" Ms. Stefanelli, 70, said, struggling to explain what she was going through. \"It's not anger. It's impotence in the face of this virus.\"\n\nThe coronavirus epidemic raging through Italy has already left streets empty and shops shuttered as 60 million Italians are essentially under house arrest. There are the exhausted doctors and nurses toiling day and night to keep people alive. There are children hanging drawings of rainbows from their windows and families singing from their balconies.\n\nBut the ultimate metric of pandemics and plagues are the bodies they leave behind. In Italy, with the oldest population in Europe, the toll has been heavy, with more than 2,100 deaths, the most outside of China. On Monday alone, more than 300 people died.\n\nAnd the bodies are piling up in the northern region of Lombardy, especially in the province of Bergamo. With 3,760 total cases reported on Monday, an increase of 344 cases from the day before, according to officials, it is at the center of the outbreak.\n\nHospital morgues there are inundated. Bergamo's mayor, Giorgio Gori, issued an ordinance that closed the local cemetery this week for the first time since World War II, though he guaranteed that its mortuary would still accept coffins. Many of them had been sent to the Church of All Saints in Bergamo, located in the closed cemetery, where scores of waxed wooden coffins form a macabre line for cremations.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we don't know where to put them,\" said Brother Marco Bergamelli, one of the priests at the church. He said that with hundreds dying each day, and with each body taking more than an hour to cremate, there was an awful backlog. \"It takes time and the dead are many.\"\n\nAn emergency national law issued last week banned civil and religious ceremonies, including funerals, to prevent the spread of the virus. Officials have allowed priests to say a prayer at burials attended by just a few of the bereaved. In his brief prayers to family members, who often wore masks, Brother Marco said that he tried to give consolation and hope and urged people to be close, if permitted, to those who were alone. \"This tragedy reminds us to love life,\" he said.\n\nGet an informed guide to the global outbreak with our daily coronavirus newsletter.\n\nIn the nearby village of Zogno, the local priest has decided to ring the death knell just once a day, to keep from ringing it all day long. In another town, Casalpusterlengo, the Rev. Pierluigi Leva said believers were taking the \"absence\" of funerals especially hard.\n\nFamily members are spirited away and, because of the danger of contagion, often die in hospital isolation without any family or friends around. Local associations in the northern city of Brescia have started collecting donations of tablet devices to give to hospitals so that coronavirus patients can stay in touch -- or say goodbye -- to their families back home.\n\nMr. Testa's death notice appeared on Friday in a local paper, L'Eco di Bergamo. The paper usually has a single page of death notices. On Friday there were 10 pages, and the rest was dedicated to the virus devastating Bergamo.\n\n\"For us, it's a trauma, an emotional trauma,\" said Alberto Ceresoli, who edits the paper. \"These are people who die alone and who are buried alone. They didn't have someone hold their hand and the funerals have to be tiny, with a quick prayer from the priest. Many of the close relatives are in quarantine.\"\n\nGiorgio Valoti, the mayor of nearby Cene, died last Friday. He was 70. His son, Alessandro, said that 90 people died the same day in Bergamo's main hospital. The virus \"is massacring this valley, every family is losing someone dear to them,\" he said. \"In Bergamo, so many bodies are piling up they don't know what to do with them.\"\n\nIn Fiobbio, a small village outside Bergamo, an ambulance came to collect Luca Carrara's father, 86, on Saturday. On Sunday, another one came for his mother, 82. Mr. Carrara, 52, couldn't visit them in hospital and stayed home in quarantine, where he has begun showing symptoms of the virus. On Tuesday, his parents died. Their bodies are held in the hospital morgue awaiting cremation.\n\n\"I am sorry that they are still there,\" he said. \"Still alone.\"\n\nLuca di Palma, 49, said his father, Vittorio, 79, died on Wednesday night, and that the funeral home he called told him that they had no space for the body. Instead, they delivered to his house a coffin, some candles, a cross and a mortuary refrigerator so that he could lay his father out in the living room. He said nobody came to pay respects, out of fear of contagion, though his father had died before he could be confirmed as a coronavirus case, and doctors had refused to perform a post-mortem swab test.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. di Palma followed a hearse carrying his father's body to a cemetery in Bergamo, where a caretaker let them in and locked the gates behind. A priest arrived to offer a brief prayer over the hearse, its trunk lifted. Mr. di Palma said his father wanted to be cremated, but the wait was long. \"Painful,\" he said.\n\nIn a country where many learn in school about the dreaded Monatti who, preceded by the ringing of a little bell, retrieved corpses on carts during the 17th-century Milan plague, the amassing of dead bodies seems out of another time.\n\nAlessandro Bosi, secretary of the National Federation of Funeral Homes, said that the virus had also caught the mortuary industry by surprise, with those who handle the dead not having sufficient masks or gloves. While health authorities say they do not believe that the virus can be transmitted posthumously, Mr. Bosi said that a corpse's lungs often released air when being moved.\n\n\"We have to consider them in the way we would treat infectious individuals, and take the same care,\" he said.\n\n\"If we're not the ones taking away the dead,\" he added, \"then they'd have to call in the army.\"\n\nIn some parts of southern Italy, where Roman Catholic traditions are particularly strong, the funeral rite has been too important for some to let go.\n\nIn the Sicilian town of Porto Empedocle, the local authorities said that they had cited 48 mourners last week for taking part in a funeral procession in defiance of national restrictions. The mourners risk three months of jail.\n\nThe Rev. Leopoldo Argento, 59, a priest there, said, \"Funerals are part of our anthropology.\" He said he understood the impulse of the mourners to congregate but thought it was necessary to suspend the funerals. Normally, 600 to 1,000 people might attend. \"In Sicily, the death of our loved ones is a very strong moment and a very important one in our social life,\" he noted.\n\nAll of Italian social life has been transformed by the virus, most acutely in Lombardy.\n\nGiacomo Grasselli, who is coordinating the intensive care unit response in Lombardy hospitals, attributed the high number of deaths in part to the advanced age of Italy's population. The average age of death, he pointed out, was about 80.\n\nHe said medical workers were more frequently forced to decide whether or not to take invasive measures to assist the breathing of the very old and sick but that, for now, every patient had received care.\n\nBut, \"This will not last forever,\" he warned, adding that the capacity to extend care to everyone depended on whether the containment measures worked. He said he took encouragement from the steep drop in new infections in the original quarantined towns of the region. \"It is the only way to survive this.\"\n\nCostantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione D'Adda, one of those formerly quarantined towns, said that 47 people had died there since Feb. 21, compared with about 50 in all of 2019. He said that despite some of his residents having received a diagnosis of pneumonia, hospital officials \"sent them home without testing them for coronavirus.\"\n\nIn Bergamo last week, when an ambulance arrived at Ms. Stefanelli's apartment for her husband, both were in bed with fevers. Three nurses entered and took Mr. Testa to the hospital and left her. That was the last time she saw him. Four days later, he was dead.\n\nShe said that she hoped his body could be kept in the Bergamo church until she and her children were released from quarantine and able to attend a funeral. She said the thought of her husband being buried without her there or having to choose who could go was unbearable.\n\n\"How can you choose among family members? The children shouldn't be there? The wife shouldn't be there?\" she said. \"This is the bitterest part.\"\n\nElisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

infected far more people in the United States than testing has shown so far, and stringent measures to limit social contact in parts of the country not yet seeing many cases are needed to significantly stem the tide of illness and death in the coming months.\n\nThose are the conclusions of Columbia University researchers who used a New York Times database of known cases and Census Bureau transportation data to model how the outbreak could evolve based on what is known about the virus. The estimates are inherently uncertain, and they could change as America adopts unprecedented measures to control the outbreak.\n\nBut they offer a stark warning: Even if the country cut its rate of transmission in half -- a tall order -- some 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months.\n\nThe growth is driven by Americans with mild symptoms who are carrying and spreading the virus without being aware that they have it, the researchers say. The number of undetected cases -- 11 times more than has been officially reported, they estimate -- reflects how far behind the United States has fallen in testing for the virus.\n\nNew York City, Seattle, Boston and parts of California already have such large outbreaks that they will probably see significant growth even after taking extraordinary measures over the past week, the researchers say. New York City's outbreak, the nation's largest, grew to more than 4,000 known cases on Friday and is likely to increase many times over even in a favorable scenario.\n\nOn the other hand, parts of the country without large clusters of cases could still avoid the worst of the outbreak -- if they impose measures like closing schools, banning mass gatherings and testing and quarantining sick people and their contacts. The epidemic would then spread inland at a much slower pace and strike with less severity, the estimates say.\n\nBut controls would need to be put in place immediately, and everywhere.\n\n\"We're looking at something that's catastrophic on a level that we have not seen for an infectious disease since 1918,\" said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia and the leader of the research team, referring to the Spanish flu. \"And it's requiring sacrifices we haven't seen since World War II. There are going to be enormous disruptions. There's no easy way out.\"\n\nControls in many places have already changed the fabric of American life. Restaurants and schools have closed, people are working from home and travelers have put off trips -- all changes that should reduce the rate of infection. In California, New York and Illinois, officials have announced more stringent directives aimed at stopping the spread. That means that at least 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay home in the coming days, and more states are expected to follow suit.\n\nBut other places have resisted. Bars and restaurants remain open in Wichita, Kan., in a county that reported its first case on Thursday night, and in Knoxville, Tenn., where reports of the virus have been scarce. Some malls remain open in Chicago, recreational marijuana shops in Oregon, and some retail chains nationwide. Many businesses are still requiring workers to come into the office.\n\n\"I'm not really supportive yet of restricting things further or closing down,\" said Pete Meitzner, head of the Board of County Commissioners in Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita, a city of about 400,000. Mr. Meitzner said he was growing increasingly anxious at the possibility that people who do not know they are ill might spread the virus, but that he also needed to consider the fate of workers as the community decided whether to close buildings.\n\n\"Some of our public offices and buildings are, but I do feel horrible for our restaurant workers and our hospitality workers at our hotels,\" he said. \"They are really suffering.\"\n\nOf the area's relative dearth of cases, Mr. Meitzner added, \"We don't know for sure if we're lucky or what.\"\n\nThe scenarios do not estimate what effect individual local actions will have on the outbreak. But if the country as a whole does not take collective action, they suggest that Sedgwick County could see a significant proportion of its population -- hundreds of thousands of people -- infected with the virus in the next two months. If the country, as a whole, can reduce rates of transmission by 50 percent, Sedgwick County could instead see fewer than 1,000 cases in that time.\n\nSeveral researchers not involved in the Columbia University analysis who reviewed the findings said they made sense and broadly agreed with their own thinking. Even in places that now appear to have few cases, they said, officials should act sooner rather than later.\n\n\"You have to think of this as an insurance for the future: The earlier you do it, the greater effect you have on the virus,\" said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, who said the estimates were in line with his own projections. \"It's better to take excessive precautions than not.\"\n\nThe economic challenges of that loom.\n\n\"We're staying open until someone forces us to shut down,\" Beau McKee, the general manager at Not Watson's Kitchen and Bar in Knoxville, said in a telephone interview, as dishes clattered in the background. \"I feel like those people that are vulnerable know who they are and they should be careful, and we should continue testing. But small businesses are getting crushed.\"\n\nMr. McKee said he has grown increasingly worried about how the virus could affect his own father, in his 70s, but that there were other worries too. \"At least we can offer a handful of people good-paying jobs and when we get out of this and we're on the other side, we'll hopefully have gained more clientele by doing so because we kind of stuck it out and didn't wave the white flag,\" he said.\n\nThe Columbia researchers' model works by observing the behavior of the outbreak in the United States up until March 13, based on case records compiled by The New York Times, commuting patterns and other data.\n\nThe researchers use those observations to infer key features of the outbreak. One is how many people each infected person has tended to infect so far, about 2.2. Another is how many people may pass on the virus without knowing that they have it. The disease is spreading far too fast to be explained by known cases alone, and only about 1 in 11 infections have been reported, they found.\n\nThose factors allow the researchers to simulate the spread of a virus in the future. They adjust those simulations under different scenarios in which the nation imposes a range of control measures to stop the spread.\n\nThe estimates are imperfect, but they are consistent with the available data. It is impossible to know the exact number of cases a week ago or to predict the future. It is also impossible to model the precise impact of unprecedented measures that America has already put in place to control the outbreak.\n\nBut the research estimates that if measures to slow the disease are not effective, the virus could sicken millions of people or more, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer.\n\nA worst-case scenario is unlikely to play out. A handful of countries, including China and South Korea, have managed to slow down their own fast-moving outbreaks through tracking and isolating sick people and reducing social contact. It is not known if measures imposed in the last week have started slowing the outbreak in the United States.\n\nBut the researchers' estimates show the enormity of the task. As in China, most of those who have been infected but not tested are likely to have mild symptoms, or none at all, the researchers say. That means they can spread the virus without being aware they are infected.\n\nSeveral researchers said that the slow pace of testing in the United States is one major reason the proportion of unreported infections is so high here. Despite a ramping up of testing in recent days, the United States still lags both Italy and South Korea in the total number of people tested and in testing per-capita, figures show.\n\nThis map shows how many people the model estimates could get the virus in each county in the United States by two months from now.\n\nOne scenario -- which is unlikely -- simulates what could happen without any intervention. A second scenario envisions what would happen with some control measures, such as partial adherance to social distancing guidlines and a patchwork of government-imposed restrictions on work, travel, and dining out. A third envisions severe control measures: strict adherance across the country to social distancing, working remotely, closing schools and restaurants and banning large gatherings.\n\nNew York City, the model indicates, could count tens of thousands of new cases every day by late spring or early summer. But if the city remains vigilant about maintaining the stringent measures recently put in place, the peak could be delayed by weeks or longer and be significantly lower, the model suggests. Dr. Shaman cautioned that the model is designed to capture national trends, and local projections should be viewed as broad estimates.\n\n\"This is serious and this is real. We have to act now and act aggressive,\" Dr. Vespignani said. \"We have to mobilize all the resources that we have. None of us has a single solution. But we have to try all of them.\"\n\nIn the days since New York's first recorded case, on March 1, the state has declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard to New Rochelle, an early focal point of the outbreak; New York City has closed schools and barred dining in at restaurants and watching Broadway shows.\n\nBut in places like Wichita, some parts of life have yet to change. In that city, bars and restaurants are allowed to operate freely as long as they keep crowds to fewer than 50 people.\n\nStill, Beverly Salas, an owner of Egg Cetera, a downtown restaurant that serves brunch and late-night bites for the bar crowd, said she chose to close the restaurant anyway. \"It was a hard decision, honestly, because we have no more income coming in,\" Ms. Salas, 24, said. But her customers include nurses from a nearby hospital and many people who are in their 60s or older, she said, and the thought that someone might somehow contract the illness at her small restaurant was too much for her to bear.\n\n\"I'm looking at other places like Italy and trying to avoid going through that,\" she said. \"Why are we not taking it as seriously as New York, Chicago, or even Kansas City? I know we're a smaller town, but there are cases all over the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"title": "Opinion | They. Sold. Their. Stock.", "body": "This article is part of David Leonhardt's newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.\n\nOn Jan. 24, Richard Burr, a Republican senator from North Carolina, attended a private Senate briefing from senior government scientists about the seriousness of the coronavirus. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican senator from Georgia, received the same briefing.\n\nAt the time, many Americans did yet understand the danger that the virus posed. The same day as the briefing, President Trump -- in one of his many attempts over the past two months to make the virus seem like a frivolous matter -- tweeted, \"It will all work out well.\"\n\nGiven the disconnect between what they knew and the public's understanding, Burr and Loeffler had an opportunity to sound the alarm. They could have broken ranks with other congressional Republicans and told the country to take the situation more seriously. They could have criticized Trump for not doing more. Such criticism, coming from Trump's own party, would have received major attention. It would have had the potential to alter Trump administration policy and, by extension, the course the disease took.\n\nBut Burr and Loeffler did virtually nothing to protect the health and safety of their constituents or of Americans in other states. Burr went so far as to co-write an article for FoxNews.com bragging about the country's readiness. Here's what the two senators did instead: they sold large amounts of their personal stock holdings, cashing in before the sharp percent decline in the market that has happened as the severity of the virus has become apparent to everyone.\n\nThe Daily Beast broke the story of Loeffler's trades, which added up to between $1.2 million and $3.1 million. She started selling the shares the same day as the briefing. She also bought \"between $100,000 and $250,000 in Citrix, a technology company that offers teleworking software\" and whose share price has risen since the crisis began, The Daily Beast's Lachlan Markay, William Bredderman, and Sam Brodey write.\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics and ProPublica broke the news of Burr's trades, which amounted to between $600,000 and $1.8 million. Among the shares that he and he wife sold were those in three hotel companies, all of which have since seen their stock prices hammered, Karl Evers-Hillstrom wrote.\n\nLoeffler was appointed to her senate seat last year by Georgia's governor, and is running for election this November. Burr is currently in his third term and has said he would not run again.\n\nTheir sales, writes Lawfare's Susan Hennessey, are \"an immense and outrageous abuse of the public trust,\" \"It's an inexcusably terrible thing to have done,\" she adds.\n\nFor more ...\n\nTucker Carlson, Fox News:\n\n[Burr] had inside information about what could happen to our country, which is now happening, but he didn't warn the public. He didn't give a prime-time address. He didn't go on television to sound the alarm. He didn't even disavow an op-ed he'd written just 10 days before claiming America was 'better prepared than ever' for coronavirus. He didn't do any of those things. Instead, what did he do? He dumped his shares in hotel stocks so he wouldn't lose money, and then he stayed silent. Now maybe there's an honest explanation for what he did. If there is, he should share it with the rest of us immediately. Otherwise, he must resign from the Senate ...\n\nMolly Knight: \"Richard Burr should not hold government office by Monday. He needs to resign today.\"\n\nDavid French, The Dispatch: \"The potential insider trading is dreadful and possibly criminal, but what could elevate this to a historic scandal is the idea that senators may have known enough to be alarmed for themselves yet still projected rosy scenarios to the public AND failed to make sure we were ready.\"\n\nDavid Frum of The Atlantic wants to know who else may have sold stock: \"What did the Trump family sell, and when did they sell it?\"\n\nThe Times editorial board argued in December that \"members of Congress should not be allowed to buy and sell stocks, or to serve on corporate boards.\" In 2012, Robert Reich notes, Burr was one of only a small number of members to vote against a law that barred them for trading on inside information.\n\nIf you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

treasure.\n\n\"I'm exhausted,\" confessed Tony Fauci when I reached him Thursday evening in the middle of another 18-hour workday.\n\n\"I have changed my tune a bit, probably thanks to my wife,\" said the 79-year-old director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \"About a week ago, I was going about four or five days in a row on about three hours of sleep, which is completely crazy, 'cause then I'll be going on fumes. The last couple of nights, I've gotten five hours' sleep, so I feel much better.\"\n\nHe said he misses the endorphins of power walking, and he is wracked when he gets home at midnight and it's too late to answer calls and emails.\n\n\"I gotta get rid of this guilt feeling,\" he murmured about that moment's 727 emails.\n\nHe said he has not been tested for the coronavirus but takes his temperature every day and usually has it taken another couple times before White House press conferences and meetings in the Oval.\n\nWhen I spoke with him, he had been missing from the White House briefing for two days and Twitter blew a gasket, with everyone from Susan Rice to Laurence Tribe seeking an answer to the urgent query, \"Where is Dr. Fauci?\"\n\nDonald Trump, the ultimate \"me\" guy, is in a \"we\" crisis and it isn't pretty. The president is so consumed by his desire to get back his binky, a soaring stock market, that he continues to taffy-twist the facts, leaving us to look elsewhere -- to Dr. Fauci and governors like Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom -- for leadership during this grim odyssey.\n\nDr. Fauci chuckled at speculation that he was banished due to his habit of pushing back on Trump's hyperbolic and self-serving ad-libbing.\n\n\"That's kind of funny but understandable that people said, 'What the hell's the matter with Fauci?' because I had been walking a fine line; I've been telling the president things he doesn't want to hear,\" he said. \"I have publicly had to say something different with what he states.\n\n\"It's a risky business. But that's my style, Maureen. You know me for many years. I say it the way it is, and if he's gonna get pissed off, he's gonna get pissed off. Thankfully, he is not. Interestingly.\"\n\nThe first time I talked to Dr. Fauci was during a panic in the mid-80s about stopping another virus, the cause of the heartbreaking AIDs crisis. Then, as now, he was honest, brave and innovative. He told me that he tries to be diplomatic when he has to contradict the president about what \"game-changer\" cures might be on the horizon and whether everyone who wants to be tested can get tested.\n\n\"I don't want to embarrass him,\" the immunologist says, in his gravelly Brooklyn accent. \"I don't want to act like a tough guy, like I stood up to the president. I just want to get the facts out. And instead of saying, 'You're wrong,' all you need to do is continually talk about what the data are and what the evidence is.\n\n\"And he gets that. He's a smart guy. He's not a dummy. So he doesn't take it -- certainly up to now -- he doesn't take it in a way that I'm confronting him in any way. He takes it in a good way.\"\n\nOn Friday, a trigger-happy Trump was so quick to talk up the fabulous possibilities of an antimalarial drug in combating the virus that Dr. Fauci had to pump the brakes, taking the microphone to explain that we do not know yet because controlled testing is needed.\n\nThe president returned to the lectern to press his unscientific case and compliment himself: \"I'm a smart guy,\" he said. \"I feel good about it. And we're going to see. You're going to see soon enough.\"\n\nProbably thinking about all his government staffers working round-the-clock, Dr. Fauci could not help rubbing his forehead and cheek -- going against his own advice to the public -- when Trump cracked a joke about the \"Deep State Department.\"\n\nThough the scientist listens respectfully when the president and the vice president are talking, he somehow manages to emit an \"Oh my God, please don't say that\" vibe when the two men scamper over the line. When Mike Pence went into false-hope overdrive, saying, \"I just can't emphasize enough about the incredible progress that we have made on testing,\" Dr. Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, the administration's virus response coordinator, exchanged a whispered aside that sent the internet into a frenzy.\n\nDr. Fauci assured me that, despite their crosscurrents and an early overconfidence about how easy it would be to control the path of the virus, the president \"absolutely\" now gets the threat of \"the invisible enemy,\" as Trump calls the virus.\n\nStill, Trump managed to have an hourlong press conference about public health guidance in which he relentlessly ran afoul of public health guidance.\n\nHe wants to think of himself as a wartime president, but he can't rise above his pettiness and defensiveness long enough to stop trashing White House reporters who are simply trying to do their job under perilous circumstances. He also can't move away from his old standby, xenophobia.\n\nTrump has never understood anything about government, so he doesn't know what the C.D.C. versus the F.D.A. versus FEMA should do. His improvisational leadership style was vividly -- and disturbingly -- on display Friday during a call with Chuck Schumer, who urged him to invoke the Defense Production Act to get ventilators and masks to desperate states -- despite the president's cavalier remark a day earlier that the federal government is \"not a shipping clerk\" for the states. \"Then POTUS yelled to someone in his office to do it now,\" a Schumer spokesman reported.\n\nTrump is just a petrified salesman who believes in perception over reality. He thinks if he can create the perception that this is going to be a quick fix and there's a little pill coming, then the stock market will roar back, along with his 2020 momentum.\n\nWith F.D.R. and the Great Depression, the only thing to fear was fear itself. With Trump and our new abyss, we have to fear not only fear but also the ignorance and misdirection of the White House and the profiteering of senators. Not to mention the virus.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

"body": "Dr. Weiner is an associate professor of educational leadership.\n\nThanks to the coronavirus, my third-grade twins are home all day for the foreseeable future. I'm not going to recreate school for them.\n\nJudge me all you want.\n\nOut of respect for their amazing teachers, I'm making a good-faith effort to get my kids to do the work that's been sent home, but that does not come anywhere close to filling what would have been a school day. After accomplishing the bare minimum, the agenda is to survive and watch too much TV. We are eating cookies and carbs and hoping for the best. We are loving one another and trying not to go insane.\n\nWhen we got the call that our schools were closing, I knew I'd start seeing social media posts with home-schooling schedules and amazing and quite labor-intensive (for adults) activities for children.\n\nMy predictions were right: There have been color-coded home school charts with every minute scheduled, online resources on how to lead children through yoga and meditation, French lessons, and building their own rocket ships. Parents are sharing recipes with the right nutritional balance to enhance study productivity. Many have already begun to lament that they're failing at meeting these new expectations.\n\nI want to send a message to parents, and in particular to working moms, who will inevitably take on most of this home labor along with working remotely: This is going to be messy and that is OK.\n\nI am not an expert in teaching third graders, particularly those like one of my sons, who has special needs and receives numerous services from talented professional educators every day to ensure he can thrive. We are so grateful to them and to our other son's teachers and their patience, wisdom, and skill. We know that we don't share these qualities.\n\nI'm also not a parenting expert -- a fact that would be clear if you met our wonderful but somewhat feral children. But I do know, from often painful firsthand experiences, that trying to turn mothering into a competitive sport is straight up unhealthy. It's not a game I want to play.\n\nMy husband and I both work full time. Like so many others, we're attempting to keep our family safe and fed during our state's Covid-19 shutdown while simultaneously working to convince our boomer parents to practice social distancing, reaching out to other loved ones and friends and trying not to panic. Even when everything in our life is working the way it should, and with all the privileges we have -- our solid health care, our economic stability, our whiteness -- we often feel overwhelmed. So this pandemic felt like a bridge too far. We had to meet it head on: holding our breath, crossing our fingers. And not judging ourselves.\n\nI've heard predictions from other parents about how this time without classroom instruction could lead to my kids (who, remember, are eight) falling behind so far that college will no longer be in their future. I hate to think of how parents who are preoccupied with worry about loss of income and how to provide food and shelter for their families feel. They must be terrified their children will be unable to keep up as moms and dads with more flexibility, more security, or even full-time help talk about their aggressive at-home enrichment agendas for their little ones. Maybe this is the perfect time to call a timeout on the academic rat-race that was never healthy or fair in the first place.\n\nYes, we have embraced the need for some schedule, taking turns keeping an eye on the kids as they surf the internet to make sure whatever they are looking at is age appropriate. (Of course, one of the boys wanted to learn about bombs.)\n\nSo far, we've seen them digging into mastodons, dwarf planets, the Mars rover and who made Legos and why. They've been reading a lot (mostly graphic novels and \"Big Nate\" books) because my kids were always avid readers and I don't have to fight with them to do it. But there are no flash cards and no made-up projects to \"enrich\" them. We do not assign them essays or ensure their explorations are aligned with Common Core standards. There is no official \"movement\" or music time. We have not set up a makeshift classroom or given our family's \"school\" a name.\n\nWe bake and have taste tests to see which cookie recipes are the best, because we like cookies and they are among the only things I know how to make. We walk and walk and walk. We eat together. We think about how lucky we are and try to help those who are more vulnerable and without our resources.\n\nSo far, the boys have played more video games and watched more television than they did during any given week before schools shut down. It keeps them busy while their dad and I try to finish our meetings before Zoom crashes.\n\nWe love each other, we yell, we apologize, we laugh, they punch each other, we yell some more, we make up. We live, we try to be compassionate and we hope this will all be a memory soon. And when it's over, the schoolwork will be there.\n\nTell us about your alternative home school plans. Are you scheduling every moment of your children's day, or are you taking a more relaxed approach?

Two thousand people applied.\n\n\"One of the reasons we found that people are unable to adopt pets in New York City is because they are never home,\" the spokeswoman, Katy Hansen, said. \"They say it is not fair to the animal, or they are not able to spend enough time with them.\"\n\nBut as the global coronavirus outbreak has people preparing to spend more time at home over the coming weeks, some who have decided that they don't want to quarantine alone are choosing to foster a pet for companionship.\n\nMost Americans are being told to stay out of bars and restaurants, to steer clear of social gatherings, to work from home and to socially distance themselves from one another to avoid the spread of the highly contagious new coronavirus, which has killed more than 9,000 people worldwide.\n\nIn interviews this week, animal shelters across the nation reported a surge in interest in fostering pets.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Staying at home \"is not a permanent state,\" California's governor says.

Usually, getting 10 pets placed in foster homes is a good day for the organization.\n\n\"To have that many new people sign up is really a big spike,\" she said.\n\nMs. Fugate said the shelter was asking for four- to six-week commitments. (The average is two to four weeks, she said.)\n\nAccording to Ms. Hansen, fostering an animal is similar to dating someone.\n\n\"You are bringing a pet into your home and there is not a long-term commitment,\" she said. \"You are seeing how it would work.\"\n\nAnd whereas dating someone new during the current pandemic is risky, fostering a new pet offers companionship with minimal risk of transmission. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, the coronavirus is more readily transmitted via nonporous surfaces like metal and plastic than porous ones like pet fur, which tends to trap the virus.\n\nIn Dallas, it seems few were worried about contracting the virus from a pet. Since the Dallas Animal Services shelter solicited foster parents on its website on Friday, it has placed more than 100 pets in foster homes. During the same period last year, the shelter placed six dogs and 11 cats in foster homes.\n\n\"Who knows what is going to happen with the coronavirus impacting people being able to leave the house, so we put the call out,\" said MeLissa Webber, assistant director of the Dallas shelter. \"So many Dallas residents showed, I got choked up.\"\n\nA foster relationship helps not only people searching for a friend to adjust to a disorienting new normal; it can also help the pets themselves cope, according to Eileen Hanavan, director of the foster and engagement program at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\n\"A lot of people are facing prolonged periods of time at home and inside,\" she said. \"They want companionship and to not feel alone during this unsettling time, and it is benefiting our animals directly.\"\n\nThe environment at shelters usually keeps animals on edge, Ms. Hansen said, adding that placing an animal in a home is healthier and makes it more likely that it will ultimately be adopted.\n\n\"From a sheltering perspective, what fostering does for an animal is immeasurable, because when they are sheltered they are stressed, tired, and we don't really know their true personality,\" she said. \"When you get them into a home, when they can sleep through the night, their true personality really comes out.\"\n\nMany shelters agree that the uptick in foster applicants can be attributed to people feeling restless during the pandemic and wanting to help, Ms. Hansen said.\n\nFor Rebecca Applebaum, a teacher who lives alone in Manhattan, fostering a litter of kittens from the A.S.P.C.A. has helped her keep a pace to her days at home.\n\n\"The routine of feeding them every day gives me structure,\" Ms. Applebaum said. \"With the pandemic situation, it is nice to have them.\"\n\n\"They do their cute thing and I talk to them,\" she added. \"That has been really good.\"\n\nA quarantine is, by definition, isolating. To Ms. Hansen, it's not surprising that many are choosing to offset those feelings with a kitten, puppy or rabbit.\n\n\"For people that are by themselves, having another heartbeat in the house makes it feel less lonely,\" she said. \"It's a win-win.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sandra_e_garcia@nytimes.com", "name": "Sandra E.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html", "title": "Opinion | Why Telling People They Don't Need Masks Backfired", "body": "Dr. Tufekci is a professor of information science who specializes in the social effects of technology.\n\nWhen news of a mysterious viral pneumonia linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, reached the outside world in early January, one of my first reactions was to order a modest supply of masks. Just a few weeks later, there wasn't a mask to be bought in stores, or online for a reasonable price -- just widespread price gouging. Many health experts, no doubt motivated by the sensible and urgent aim of preserving the remaining masks for health care workers, started telling people that they didn't need masks or that they wouldn't know how to wear them.\n\nAs the pandemic rages on, there will be many difficult messages for the public. Unfortunately, the top-down conversation around masks has become a case study in how not to communicate with the public, especially now that the traditional gatekeepers like media and health authorities have much less control. The message became counterproductive and may have encouraged even more hoarding because it seemed as though authorities were shaping the message around managing the scarcity rather than confronting the reality of the situation.\n\nFirst, many health experts, including the surgeon general of the United States, told the public simultaneously that masks weren't necessary for protecting the general public and that health care workers needed the dwindling supply. This contradiction confuses an ordinary listener. How do these masks magically protect the wearers only and only if they work in a particular field?\n\nSecond, there were attempts to bolster the first message, that ordinary people didn't need masks, by telling people that masks, especially medical-grade respirator masks (such as the N95 masks), needed proper fitting and that ordinary people without such fitting wouldn't benefit. This message was also deeply counterproductive. Many people also wash their hands wrong, but we don't respond to that by telling them not to bother. Instead, we provide instructions; we post signs in bathrooms; we help people sing songs that time their hand-washing. Telling people they can't possibly figure out how to wear a mask properly isn't a winning message. Besides, when you tell people that something works only if done right, they think they will be the person who does it right, even if everyone else doesn't.\n\nThird, of course masks work -- maybe not perfectly and not all to the same degree, but they provide some protection. Their use has always been advised as part of the standard response to being around infected people, especially for people who may be vulnerable. World Health Organization officials wear masks during their news briefings. That was the reason I had bought a few in early January -- I had been conducting research in Hong Kong, which has a lot of contact with mainland China, and expected to go back. I had studied and taught about the sociology of pandemics and knew from the SARS experience in 2003 that health officials in many high-risk Asian countries had advised wearing masks.\n\nIt is of course true that masks don't work perfectly, that they don't replace hand-washing and social distancing, and that they work better if they fit properly. And of course, surgical masks (the disposable type that surgeons wear) don't filter out small viral particles the way medical-grade respirator masks rated N95 and above do. However, even surgical masks protect a bit more than not wearing masks at all. We know from flu research that mask-wearing can help decrease transmission rates along with frequent hand-washing and social-distancing. Now that we are facing a respirator mask shortage, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that surgical masks are \"an acceptable alternative\" for health care workers -- again, obviously because some protection, even if imperfect, is better than none. In the face of this, publicly presenting an absolute answer -- \"You don't need them\" -- for something that requires a qualified response just makes people trust authorities even less.\n\nFourth, the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. told the public to wear masks if they were sick. However, there is increasing evidence of asymptotic transmission, especially through younger people who have milder cases and don't know they are sick but are still infectious. Since the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. do say that masks lessen the chances that infected people will infect others, then everyone should use masks. If the public is told that only the sick people are to wear masks, then those who do wear them will be stigmatized and people may well avoid wearing them if it screams \"I'm sick.\" Further, it's very difficult to be tested for Covid-19 in the United States. How are people supposed to know for sure when to mask up?\n\nFifth, places like Hong Kong and Taiwan that jumped to action early with social distancing and universal mask wearing have the pandemic under much greater control, despite having significant travel from mainland China. Hong Kong health officials credit universal mask wearing as part of the solution and recommend universal mask wearing. In fact, Taiwan responded to the coronavirus by immediately ramping up mask production.\n\nSixth, masks are an important signal that it's not business as usual as well as an act of solidarity. Pandemics require us to change our behavior -- our socialization, hygiene, work and more -- collectively, and knowing our fellow citizens are on board is important for all efforts.\n\nFinally, providing top-down guidance with such obvious contradictions backfires exactly because lack of trust is what fuels hoarding and misinformation. It used to be said that back in the Soviet Union, if there was a line, you first got in line and then figured out what the line was for -- people knew that there were going to be shortages and that the authorities often lied, so they hoarded. And when people feel as though they may not be getting the full truth from the authorities, snake-oil sellers and price gougers have an easier time.\n\nGiven that there is indeed a mask shortage and that medical workers absolutely do need these masks more, what should the authorities have said? The full painful truth. Despite warnings from experts for decades, especially after the near miss of SARS, we still weren't prepared for this pandemic, and we did not ramp up domestic production when we could, and now there's a mask shortage -- and that's disastrous because our front line health care workers deserve the best protection. Besides, if they fall ill, we will all be doomed.\n\nIf anything, a call for people who hoarded masks to donate some of them to their local medical workers would probably work better than telling people that they don't need them or that they won't manage to make them work. \"Look, more masks would be great. We are doing our best to ramp up production. Till then, if our medical workers fall ill, we will all be worse off. Please donate any excess -- maybe more than two weeks' worth per person -- to your hospital\" sounds corny, but it's the truth. Two weeks is a reasonable standard because the C.D.C. and the W.H.O. still recommend wearing masks if you're taking care of someone with a milder illness self-isolating at home, something that will increasingly be necessary as hospitals get overwhelmed.\n\nResearch shows that during disasters, people can show strikingly altruistic behavior, but interventions by authorities can backfire if they fuel mistrust or treat the public as an adversary rather than people who will step up if treated with respect. Given that even homemade masks may work better than no masks, wearing them might be something to direct people to do while they stay at home more, as we all should.\n\nWe will no doubt face many challenges as the pandemic moves through our societies, and people will need to cooperate. The sooner we create the conditions under which such cooperation can bloom, the better off we all will be.\n\nZeynep Tufekci (@zeynep) is an associate professor at the University of North Carolina, the author of \"Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest\" and a contributing opinion writer.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
