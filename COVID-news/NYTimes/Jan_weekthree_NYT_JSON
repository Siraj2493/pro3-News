Cases have also been reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand.\n\nHere is what we know about the virus, where it has been found, how it is spreading, and what precautions are being taken:\n\nThe virus emerged in the city of Wuhan.\n\nThe government of Wuhan, a city in central China, first confirmed on Dec. 31 that hospitals in the city were treating dozens of patients for pneumonia with an unknown cause.\n\nMany of the cases were connected to the Huanan Seafood Market, which also sold live poultry and exotic animal meats. Considered a likely source of the virus, the market was closed and disinfected.\n\nThe health commission in Wuhan said on Sunday that the illness had also appeared in people who had not been exposed to the market, raising the possibility that the virus could be present elsewhere in the city.\n\nLocal officials have pledged to handle the outbreak with transparency. But the memory of how China initially covered up the extent of a deadly SARS outbreak that infected more than 8,000 people in 2002 and 2003 has not completely faded. Although flu experts have said the Chinese government is trying to be more transparent now, many in China remain skeptical.\n\nOver the weekend, the number of reported cases more than tripled to about 200, mostly in Wuhan. One more person in the city died, bringing the total death toll to three, while nine others remained critically ill, the city's health commission said. Twenty-five people have recovered.\n\nOn Monday, two new cases were reported in Beijing and one in Shenzhen, the first cases outside Wuhan.\n\nThe World Health Organization said the spike in reported cases was the result of increased searching and testing of respiratory illnesses.\n\nCases have been reported outside China.\n\nThe authorities in Thailand detected the new coronavirus last week in two Chinese women who had flown from Wuhan to Bangkok on separate trips. The government said the women, aged 74 and 61, were in good condition.\n\nIn Japan, a Chinese man who returned from Wuhan on Jan. 6 was also confirmed to have the disease. He was discharged after five days in a hospital.\n\nSouth Korea confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on Monday in a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived on Sunday at Incheon International Airport, which served Seoul.\n\nThe woman was found with a fever, muscle pain and other symptoms while going through customs and was immediately quarantined for tests, said Jung Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe woman was traveling with five other people intending to spend the Lunar New Year holidays in South Korea and Japan, Ms. Jung said. South Korean officials were running tests anyone who was believed to have come in contact with the woman in the plane, she said.\n\nOfficials have implemented precautionary measures.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the government initiated a disease response plan after the first cases were reported in Wuhan. Dozens of people were hospitalized after returning to Hong Kong from mainland China, but none were found to have been infected with the new virus.\n\nFive people who traveled from Wuhan to Zhejiang, a coastal Chinese province south of Shanghai, are being treated for fever but have not been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, the health authorities there said.\n\nThe mayor of Shanghai said Monday that the city was monitoring cases of potential infections, but did not say that any had been confirmed.\n\nIn the southern city of Shenzhen, the authorities have started imposing temperature screening procedures at the airport and at train and bus stations. The city also said it would also crack down on the illegal trading of wild animals.\n\nIt doesn't appear to spread easily between humans.\n\nResearchers in China identified the mysterious pneumonialike illness in early January as a new coronavirus. Experts said it does not appear to be readily spread by humans, but cautioned that more research was necessary.\n\nCoronaviruses are named after the spikes that protrude from their membranes, like the sun's corona. Such viruses cause several illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe diseases like SARS.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, common signs of infection include fever, cough, and respiratory difficulties like shortness of breath. Serious cases can lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and even death.\n\nAnimals appear to be the most likely source.\n\nThe W.H.O. says animals appear to be the most likely primary source of the outbreak, though it is still not known which animals are responsible.\n\nPast outbreaks of similar illnesses, like SARS, were believed to have emerged from markets where people and live animals were in regular contact.\n\nThe organization says it is possible that the virus could spread between people who are in close contact, but it was unclear whether the disease could spread easily between humans.\n\nTo prevent the spread of respiratory infections, the W.H.O. recommends that people wash their hands regularly, cover their mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing, and avoid direct contact with farm or wild animals.\n\nThe health authorities in Hong Kong have also advised residents traveling outside the city not to touch live animals, not to eat wild animals, and to avoid markets selling fresh meat and live poultry.\n\nChoe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.

central city of Wuhan, after the death toll jumped to 17 from 9.\n\nA city of 11 million is put on lockdown.\n\nChinese authorities on Thursday morning closed off Wuhan -- a major port city of more than 11 million people and the center of a pneumonia-like virus that has spread halfway around the world -- by canceling planes and trains leaving the city, and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it.\n\nIn Wuhan, residents said that a sense of fear was growing as the city went into lockdown.\n\nThe new virus, which first emerged at the end of December, has killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 570, including in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United States. It has raised the specter of a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in 2002 and 2003 and spread rapidly while officials obscured the seriousness of the crisis. That virus eventually killed more than 800 people worldwide.\n\nRoughly 30,000 people fly out of Wuhan on an average day, according to air traffic data. Many more leave using ground transportation like trains and cars. The city is the hub of industry and commerce in central China, home to the region's biggest airport and deepwater port.\n\nThe sudden restrictions could upend the travel plans of millions of Chinese citizens, who travel in huge numbers during the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins on Friday. The government said it would close Wuhan's airport and train stations to departures, and it urged residents not to leave the city -- a major transportation hub -- unless they had an urgent reason to do so.\n\nResidents in Wuhan are nervous. Some are also angry.\n\nSome residents were directing their anger at the local authorities, accusing them of not doing enough to contain the crisis.\n\n\"The government did not fulfill its duty,\" Du Hanrong, 56, a retiree, said by telephone. \"They just are doing things hastily and carelessly.\"\n\nOthers said they were going about business as usual, and that people were still going out to shop for the New Year. Still, many residents were taking precautions, such as canceling plans to have dinner with friends and relatives for the holiday.\n\n\"We are all quarantining ourselves at home voluntarily now,\" said Tony Li, 39. \"Cutting off the city is necessary. Wuhan is the center of the epidemic, after all.\"\n\nThe outbreak is testing Wuhan's health care system. Several Wuhan residents said on social media websites that they had gone from hospital to hospital, waiting in lines for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment later if symptoms persisted in a few days.\n\nDoctors told some patients that there was a shortage of hospital beds as well as testing kits, according to posts on Chinese social media sites. According to Chinese news reports, a patient flew to Dalian to seek treatment at hospitals there after he was sent home from a hospital in Wuhan. In Dalian, he tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nCalls to local hospitals in Wuhan rang unanswered Wednesday.\n\nMaps: Where the Wuhan Coronavirus Has Spread\n\nThe virus has sickened hundreds of people in Asia and one person in the United States.\n\nReporting was contributed by Amy Qin, Vivian Wang, Russell Goldman, Christopher Buckley, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, Tiffany May and Elaine Yu.

"What We Know About the Wuhan Coronavirus", "body": "A mysterious virus has caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness. Now the infection has arrived in the U.S.\n\nAn outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has killed six people and sickened more than 300, and has spread to at least five other countries. The first case outside of Asia was announced on Tuesday, as federal health officials confirmed that a Washington State man who had recently traveled to China had been hospitalized.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of what we know so far.\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nCoronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, which resemble the sun's corona. They can infect both animals and people, and cause illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe conditions like SARS, which sickened thousands of people around the world -- and killed nearly 800 -- during a 2003 outbreak.\n\nHow do I know if I'm infected with the new coronavirus?\n\nSymptoms of infection include a high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection very difficult. Little is known about who is most at risk. Most of the half-dozen patients who have died also suffered other illnesses.\n\nHow was this virus identified?\n\nOn Jan. 8, The New York Times reported that Chinese researchers had identified a new coronavirus as the pathogen behind a mysterious illness that had sickened 59 people in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China.\n\nThe cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. The market was later shut down and disinfected.\n\nThe number of human infections has grown dramatically, to more than 300 in China, and cases have now been confirmed in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The six people who have died from the illness were in Wuhan, and many of the others infected had lived in or traveled there.\n\nThe first case outside of Asia was announced on Tuesday. Health officials said that the infected man, a resident of Snohomish County, Wash., had recently traveled in the Wuhan region.\n\n[Read about the American patient diagnosed with a coronavirus infection.]\n\nA day earlier, a top Chinese scientist said that the coronavirus was capable of spreading from person to person, adding to fears of a broader epidemic. The Chinese government warned that anyone who hides infections will be \"forever nailed to history's pillar of shame.\"\n\nAirports around the world, including some in the United States and Australia, are screening passengers from Wuhan. On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced expanded screening measures in the United States.\n\nThe World Health Organization has called a meeting on Wednesday to decide whether to declare the coronavirus outbreak an international health emergency.\n\nPlaces With Confirmed Cases of Coronavirus\n\nNote: Confirmed cases as of Jan. 21, 2020.\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nWhat is the source of the outbreak?\n\nAnimals are the most likely primary source of the outbreak -- but it is not clear which animals. Past outbreaks of similar illnesses, including SARS, were also believed to have emerged from live animal markets. Another coronavirus, MERS, is transmitted to humans by camels.\n\nWhat can people do to protect themselves?\n\nDr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that travelers to China should \"absolutely\" avoid live animal markets, and keep their distance from any animals in rural areas. He reiterated that travelers should practice \"good hand hygiene,\" and try to avoid anyone coughing and sneezing.\n\nRoni Caryn Rabin contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

They said they would promptly announce if testing confirmed the patient's illness is a case of Wuhan coronavirus.\n\nThe United States identified its first confirmed Wuhan coronavirus patient in Washington State earlier this week after a man who had traveled to the Wuhan region became sick and sought medical attention. Officials have been working to contact people who were on his flight home and are monitoring 16 people they have identified as having had close contact with that patient in recent days.\n\nWhile assuring the public that there was little threat, officials said Wednesday that they also believed it would not be the last Wuhan coronavirus case to reach the United States.\n\nThe strain of coronavirus surfaced in December and has spread through parts of Asia, sickening hundreds and killing at least 17 people. The authorities in China have since closed off Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people, by canceling flights and trains leaving the city, and suspending bus, subway and ferry service within it. Travel restrictions have been extended to several cities nearby.\n\nThe United States has implemented its own travel limits, funneling passengers who have traveled recently to Wuhan through a handful

11 million people, China is trying to halt a coronavirus outbreak using a tactic with a complicated history of ethical concerns.\n\nIn closing off Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people, China is deploying a centuries-old public health tactic to prevent the spread of infectious disease -- this time, a mysterious respiratory infection caused by a coronavirus.\n\nExperts said the stunning scale of the shutdown, isolating a major urban transit hub larger than New York City, was without precedent.\n\n\"It's an unbelievable undertaking,\" said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan, adding that he had never heard of so many people being cordoned off as a disease-prevention measure.\n\nStill, \"people are going to get out,\" he said. \"It's going to be leaky.\"\n\nBy limiting the movements of millions of people in an attempt to protect public health, China is engaging in a balancing act with a long and complicated history fraught with social, political and ethical concerns.\n\nJames G. Hodge Jr., director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University, said the shutdown would almost certainly lead to human rights violations and would be patently unconstitutional in the United States.\n\n\"It could very easily backfire,\" he said, adding that the restrictions could prevent healthy people from fleeing the city, perhaps exposing them to greater risk of infection. \"In general, this is risky business.\"\n\nTo combat the spread of the virus, which first appeared at the end of December and has killed at least 17 people and sickened more than 500, the Chinese government said it would cancel planes and trains leaving Wuhan beginning Thursday, and suspend buses, subways and ferries within it.\n\nThe practice of isolating people and goods to halt the spread of disease dates at least to the 14th century, when ships arriving in Venice during the plague epidemic were required to anchor off the coast for 40 days. The isolation period gave rise to the term quarantine, from the Italian quaranta giorni, meaning 40 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nProfessor Hodge said quarantines could be effective if they selectively isolate only those who have been infected or are suspected of infection. The response in Wuhan, with the establishment of a \"cordon sanitaire\"-type boundary, goes much further than that.\n\n\"Quarantine would be saying 'You can't leave your own home, can't go to school, work or church,'\" he said. But the Chinese authorities \"have drawn a line around this city and said, 'No one in and no one out.' That type of thing is obviously an excessive response.\"\n\nIn recent years, governments have imposed other large-scale measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nSierra Leone, a country of about seven million people, said \"everybody\" was expected to stay indoors for three days in September 2014, as 7,000 teams of health and community workers went door to door to find hidden Ebola patients.\n\nEarlier that year, Liberian officials placed West Point, a sprawling slum in Monrovia where 60,000 to 120,000 people were crammed into shacks, under an Ebola quarantine. The order led to deadly clashes with soldiers and may have helped to spread the disease, experts said, forcing people to crowd together for basic humanitarian aid.\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak of 2003, Canadian health officials asked anyone in Ontario who had even one symptom of the respiratory infection to stay home for a few days out of fear that the disease might spread during the Easter holiday weekend.\n\nIn Beijing, at least 4,000 residents who had been exposed to the virus were kept in isolation, and 300 college students who had had contact with infected people were sequestered in a military camp for two weeks.\n\nHistorians have noted that quarantines have often targeted marginalized populations.\n\nDuring the plague epidemic of the 14th century, European city-states posted armed guards on roads and access points to keep out merchants, people with leprosy and minority groups such as Jews, according to Eugenia Tognotti, a researcher in Italy who has written on the history of quarantine.\n\nAnd during a wave of cholera outbreaks in Europe in the 1830s, Naples restricted the movement of prostitutes and beggars, who were thought to be carriers of the contagion, she wrote.\n\nRussian Jews brought typhus fever into the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1892, Dr. Markel said. It was not only infected people who were rounded up and quarantined on an island off the Bronx, however, but also their neighbors and others whom they had simply greeted on the street.\n\n\"That's the darker side of quarantine -- its misuse as a social tool rather than its scientific use as a medical tool,\" Dr. Markel said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

Australian officials said Tuesday that the country would begin screening passengers on flights from Wuhan, the Chinese city where a new coronavirus has infected more than 200 people and killed at least four, as global concern has grown about the spread of the disease.\n\nAdding to worries about the outbreak was confirmation by a prominent Chinese scientist on Monday night that the disease is capable of spreading from person to person. Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a scientist leading a group of experts in examining the outbreak in Wuhan, said the virus could be present in particles of saliva and that in one case, a patient appeared to have infected 14 medical workers.\n\nThe number of reported cases in China more than tripled earlier this week as the authorities expanded testing across the country. Most of the cases were found in Wuhan, where the disease was first reported last month. Major Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen have also reported cases of infections.\n\nInfections have been confirmed abroad in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, all in people who traveled from Wuhan. The World Health Organization said it would hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak was an international public health emergency.\n\nConfirmed Cases of Coronavirus\n\nNote: Confirmed cases as of Jan. 21, 2020.\n\nBy The New York Times\n\n\"It is now very clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission,\" said Dr. Takeshi Kasai, the Western Pacific regional director for the World Health Organization.\n\nDr. Kasai said that the infections among health care workers added to the evidence that the virus was spreading between humans, but more analysis of the data was necessary to understand the full extent of such transmission.\n\nOn Monday, China's health commission said it would respond with measures intended to manage outbreaks of the most virulent diseases, including mandatory reporting of cases, and classified the virus as a class B infectious disease -- a category that includes diseases such as SARS.\n\nThe authorities in Wuhan will begin barring group tours from traveling outside of the city and carry out checks of vehicles to search for live animals, state media reported on Monday. The city has also installed infrared thermometers at airports, and bus and train stations.\n\nThe potential for the disease to spread across more countries has prompted health authorities to step up checks at their borders.\n\nIn Australia, border security and biosecurity staff will meet and screen passengers from three direct flights from Wuhan to Sydney, Brendan Murphy, the government's chief medical officer, said Tuesday.\n\nProfessor Murphy warned, however, that such measures were not foolproof. Some people who are carrying the virus might not show symptoms, he added.\n\n\"You cannot absolutely prevent entry into the country of a disease like this,\" he said.\n\nAustralia is also considering expanding the screening to cover more of the 160 flights that come from China each week.\n\nIn the Australian state of Queensland, health officials placed in quarantine a man who had traveled to Wuhan and returned with a respiratory illness.\n\n\"The man will remain in isolation until his symptoms have resolved,\" the Queensland health department said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that the United States would begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan at airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the authorities have reported more than 100 potential infections. So far, none have tested positive for the new coronavirus, and most have been discharged. But the possibility of the illness emerging in the territory remained, Matthew Cheung, the city's second-highest official, said Tuesday.\n\nHigh-speed rail passengers will have their temperatures checked on arrival in Hong Kong. Air passengers from Wuhan will be required to declare their health status, and people suspected of having an infection will be \"forcibly transferred to public hospital to be treated in isolation,\" Mr. Cheung said.\n\nElaine Yu in Hong Kong and Javier C.

hundreds. Now the World Health Organization must decide whether to declare another global health emergency.\n\nLess than a month after the first few cases of a new respiratory illness were reported in Wuhan, China, travelers have carried the virus to at least four other countries, including the United States. More than 400 people have been infected, at least 17 have died -- and the world is bracing itself for what might come next.\n\nOn Wednesday, experts at the World Health Organization will meet to decide whether to declare the outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern,\" a label given to \"serious public health events that endanger international public health\" and \"potentially require a coordinated international response.\"\n\nPublic health officials around the world are on alert because the new infection is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family that caused outbreaks of SARS and MERS, killing hundreds of people in dozens of countries.\n\nThe W.H.O. has already advised governments to be prepared for the disease, to be vigilant and ready to test anyone with symptoms like cough and fever who has traveled to affected regions. Air travel is expected to surge as the Lunar New Year approaches this weekend.\n\nSeveral countries have already begun screening travelers from China for fever and cough. Airports in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco last week started to screen arriving flights from Wuhan, and airports in Atlanta and Chicago will begin doing so this week.\n\nMaps: Where the Wuhan Coronavirus Has Spread\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 400 people in Asia and one person in the United States.\n\nBut important questions about the outbreak are still unanswered, and W.H.O.'s expert committee now must grapple with significant unknowns.\n\n\"We don't know how many people are infected,\" said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the W.H.O. \"The more you test, the more you will find people who are infected. We don't know if there are asymptomatic cases. If they are asymptomatic, are they contagious?\"\n\nBroad studies to test for evidence of infection, past and present, would give a true picture of how many people have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"Testing is possible because China immediately shared the genetic sequence of the virus, and we have to give them credit for that,\" Mr. Jasarevic said.\n\nThe virus causes a pneumonialike illness, with coughing and fever in some people but not all. The severity matters: If there are cases with mild illness or no symptoms at all, they may go undetected, and those people will keep working, shopping and traveling, possibly infecting others.\n\nA milder illness has the potential to spread farther and cause longer-lasting outbreaks than one with more obvious symptoms, according to Dr. Mark R. Denison, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine who studies coronaviruses.\n\nCompared to SARS and MERS, the Wuhan illness so far does seem less severe, he said.\n\nSARS, which began in live-animal markets in China in 2002, quickly spread to dozens of countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 800. The virus is thought to have originated in bats and spread to civet cats that were being sold for consumption.\n\nThe civets spread the virus to humans, who infected one another through respiratory secretions and also exposure to feces.\n\nSARS often caused severe illness, so cases were detectable; aggressive public health measures, including quarantines and travel restrictions, helped stamp out the epidemic.\n\nBut the travel bans, not to mention widespread fear and distrust, took a heavy economic toll on China, and since then international authorities have become hesitant about taking drastic steps to quell outbreaks.\n\nMERS cases have been occurring in the Middle East since 2012, mainly in people who have been exposed to camels, which were most likely infected by bats. Human-to-human transmission does occur, and some spread has happened in hospitals.\n\nAs of November, there had been 2,494 cases of MERS in the last seven years, mostly in Saudi Arabia. The death rate is 34 percent, but may actually be lower if there are mild cases of the disease that have not been detected or counted.\n\nDr. Denison described the new Wuhan coronavirus as \"sort of a first cousin of SARS,\" more closely related to it than to MERS, based on its genetic sequence.\n\nResearchers do not know just how contagious the Wuhan coronavirus is. The first people to be infected are thought to have contracted it at a market in Wuhan that sold meat, fish and live animals.\n\nThat market has been shut down and disinfected. Which animal might have been carrying the virus is not yet known.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nInitially, the illness appeared to spread only from animals to people. Then, experts said there was evidence of \"limited\" human-to-human transmission. Now, more cases are emerging among people with no known exposure to the animal markets, and in medical staff members caring for infected patients.\n\n\"Now that you have a cluster of 14 health care workers infected, it suggests that the potential for spread is much greater,\" said Dr. Ian W. Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York, who has researched SARS and MERS.\n\n\"I saw film footage of a hospital lobby in Wuhan, and they are wearing full personal protective equipment from head to toe,\" he said. \"They are taking it very seriously. I still don't think this is as bad as SARS, but it's worse than they originally portrayed it.\"\n\nDr. Denison said that with both SARS and MERS, there were episodes in which individual patients became \"super-spreaders\" who infected many other people, for unknown reasons.\n\n\"That's a wild card we don't know, the capacity to have multiple transmissions from one person,\" Dr. Denison said. \"There was no evidence they had dramatically different virus.\"\n\nIt is possible, he said, that super-spreaders had received a high dose of the virus and had more of it to transmit. Alternatively, their immune systems might have not been able to control the virus, allowing it to multiply and spread extensively in their bodies, making them more contagious.\n\nAlthough no drugs have been approved specifically to treat coronavirus diseases, Dr. Denison said that in animal studies, an antiviral called remdesivir appeared effective. He has been working with other researchers to develop treatments.\n\nMr. Jasarevic said that antivirals were being tested against MERS, but that none had been approved yet.\n\nHow and why viruses that have peacefully coexisted with their animal hosts for a long time strike out for new territory -- us -- is not well understood.\n\nCoronaviruses often inhabit bats without harming them, and sometimes move into other animal species and from them to humans.\n\nIn places that bring multiple animal species together with lots of people -- like the food markets in Wuhan and in other parts of China that sell live mammals and birds, along with meat and fish -- viruses can pass back and forth between species, mutating as they go. Along the way, they may become able to infect humans.\n\n\"Coronaviruses have repeatedly shown an ability to probe across species and cause new animal and human diseases,\" Dr. Denison said.\n\nTo go successfully from animal hosts to people, the viruses need to adapt in several ways: They must gain the ability to invade human cells, evade the immune system, replicate inside the human body and spread to others.\n\nThe move is often described as \"jumping\" into humans, but that is an oversimplification, Dr. Denison said. \"The process it has to go through is more like high hurdles with a thousand hurdles along the way,\" he said.\n\nStill, the new outbreak does not greatly surprise him: \"This was a matter of not if, but when.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

about the virus's spread, saying he feels \"powerless.\"\n\nWhen the man finally went to a hospital, he had been sick for a week. It was Dec. 26, and Mr. Zeng, 61, was weak with a cough. He got worse. A day later he was transferred to intensive care and on Dec. 30 he was put on a ventilator to help his deteriorating ability to breathe.\n\nHe was moved to another hospital and attached to another machine that oxygenated his blood. Still he got worse, and on Jan. 9, his heart stopped. Mr. Zeng, who the authorities have only identified by his last name, became the first confirmed death from the new coronavirus that emerged in the central city of Wuhan and has spread around the country and beyond.\n\nChina's health commission, which has tightly controlled news about the toll of the outbreak, on Thursday released the most complete details about the 17 confirmed deaths from the disease. The information was released as the authorities canceled transportation from Wuhan and largely blocked residents from leaving.\n\nThe details were revealed as medical experts have questioned whether the measures in Wuhan have come too late to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has been found in infected travelers in Washington state, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan.\n\nDr. Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong who visited Wuhan earlier this week, warned there was a potential for the virus to spread rapidly despite the controls put in place Thursday morning.\n\n\"We have a chance to have a pandemic outbreak,\" said Dr. Guan, who was part of the team that identified the coronavirus that caused the deadly SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003. SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800.\n\nDr. Guan also told Caixin, an influential Chinese magazine known for its investigative reports, that he had traveled to Wuhan earlier in the week hoping to help track the virus's animal source and control the epidemic. But he left, he said, feeling \"powerless, very angry.\"\n\nDr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who advised the Chinese government and the World Health Organization during the SARS outbreak, said that infected people outside Wuhan would continue to spread the disease.\n\n\"The horse is already out of the barn,\" he said.\n\nAn examination of the information provided by the government about the 17 reported deaths show a disease that has thus far largely killed older men, many of whom had underlying health problems.\n\nMost had gone to the hospital with a fever and a cough, though at least three did not have fevers when they were admitted, according to the health commission's statement.\n\nThe victims include 13 men and four women. All were identified only by their last names. The youngest was a 48-year-old woman, Yin, who died on Monday, more than a month after her symptoms were first recorded. The oldest cases were two 89-year-old men who died on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nMany had underlying conditions like cirrhosis of the liver, hypertension, diabetes and Parkinson's disease.\n\nWhile much about the virus remains unknown, medical experts found some positive signs in the fact that the disease did not appear to be killing young and otherwise healthy people.\n\nIt was a somewhat reassuring

El primer caso fuera de Asia se anunci\u00f3 el martes, cuando funcionarios federales de salud de Estados Unidos confirmaron que un hombre del estado de Washington que hab\u00eda viajado recientemente a China hab\u00eda sido hospitalizado.\n\nAqu\u00ed tienes un resumen r\u00e1pido de lo que sabemos hasta ahora.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es un coronavirus?\n\nLos coronavirus reciben su nombre debido a los picos que sobresalen de sus membranas, que se asemejan a la corona del sol. Pueden infectar tanto a animales como a humanos y causar enfermedades del tracto respiratorio, que van desde el resfriado com\u00fan hasta afecciones graves como el SARS, que afect\u00f3 a miles de personas en todo el mundo y mat\u00f3 a casi 800 durante un brote de 2003.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo puedo saber si tengo el nuevo coronavirus?\n\nLos s\u00edntomas de infecci\u00f3n incluyen fiebre alta, dificultad para respirar y lesiones pulmonares.

La mayor\u00eda de la media docena de pacientes que murieron tambi\u00e9n sufr\u00edan de otras enfermedades.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo se identific\u00f3 el virus?\n\nThe New York Times inform\u00f3 el 8 de enero que unos investigadores chinos identificaron un nuevo coronavirus como el pat\u00f3geno detr\u00e1s de una misteriosa enfermedad que enferm\u00f3 a 59 personas en Wuhan, una ciudad de 11 millones de habitantes en el centro de China.\n\nLos casos estaban vinculados a trabajadores en un mercado que vend\u00eda peces vivos, animales y aves. El mercado despu\u00e9s fue cerrado y desinfectado.\n\nLa cantidad de infecciones en humanos ha crecido dram\u00e1ticamente en China, donde asciende a m\u00e1s de 300 y ahora hay casos confirmados en Taiw\u00e1n, Jap\u00f3n, Tailandia y Corea del Sur. Las seis personas que han fallecido a causa de la enfermedad se encontraban en Wuhan y otros de los que se contagiaron hab\u00edan vivido o trabajado all\u00ed.\n\nEl martes, funcionarios de salud anunciaron el primer caso fuera de Asia. Dijeron que el hombre infectado, residente en el condado Snohomish, en el estado de Washington, hab\u00eda viajado recientemente a la regi\u00f3n de Wuhan.\n\n[Lee en ingl\u00e9s sobre el paciente estadounidense diagnosticado con coronavirus.]\n\nUn d\u00eda antes, el lunes 20 de enero, un cient\u00edfico chino de alto rango dijo que el coronavirus era capaz de transmitirse de persona a persona, lo que caus\u00f3 temores de una epidemia m\u00e1s amplia. El gobierno chino advirti\u00f3 que cualquiera que escondiera infecciones estar\u00eda \"para siempre clavado al pilar hist\u00f3rico de la verg\u00fcenza\".\n\nAeropuertos de todo el mundo, entre ellos algunos en Estados Unidos y Australia, est\u00e1n revisando a los pasajeros que llegan procedentes de Wuhan. El martes, los Centros para el Control y la Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades de Estados Unidos anunciaron medidas de detecci\u00f3n ampliadas en el pa\u00eds.\n\nLa Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud ha convocado a una reuni\u00f3n el mi\u00e9rcoles 22 de enero para decidir si se declara que este brote de coronavirus constituye una emergencia de salud.\n\n\u00bfDe d\u00f3nde surgi\u00f3 el brote?\n\nLos animales son la fuente primaria m\u00e1s probable del brote, pero no queda claro qu\u00e9 animales. Tambi\u00e9n se cree que brotes anteriores de enfermedades similares, incluido el SARS, surgieron de los mercados de animales vivos.

"title": "As New Virus Spreads From China, Scientists See Grim Reminders", "body": "Epidemics of related viruses, like SARS, killed hundreds. Now the World Health Organization must decide whether to declare another global health emergency.\n\nLess than a month after the first few cases of a new respiratory illness were reported in Wuhan, China, travelers have carried the virus to at least four other countries, including the United States. More than 400 people have been infected, at least nine have died -- and the world is bracing itself for what might come next.\n\nOn Wednesday, experts at the World Health Organization will meet to decide whether to declare the outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern,\" a label given to \"serious public health events that endanger international public health\" and \"potentially require a coordinated international response.\"\n\nPublic health officials around the world are on alert because the new infection is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family that caused outbreaks of SARS and MERS, killing hundreds of people in dozens of countries.\n\nThe W.H.O. has already advised governments to be prepared for the disease, to be vigilant and ready to test anyone with symptoms like cough and fever who has traveled to affected regions. Air travel is expected to surge as the Lunar New Year approaches this weekend.\n\nSeveral countries have already begun screening travelers from China for fever and cough. Airports in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco last week started to screen arriving flights from Wuhan, and airports in Atlanta and Chicago will begin doing so this week.\n\nMaps: Where the Wuhan Coronavirus Has Spread\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 400 people in Asia and one person in the United States.\n\nBut important questions about the outbreak are still unanswered, and W.H.O.'s expert committee now must grapple with significant unknowns.\n\n\"We don't know how many people are infected,\" said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the W.H.O. \"The more you test, the more you will find people who are infected. We don't know if there are asymptomatic cases. If they are asymptomatic, are they contagious?\"\n\nBroad studies to test for evidence of infection, past and present, would give a true picture of how many people have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"Testing is possible because China immediately shared the genetic sequence of the virus, and we have to give them credit for that,\" Mr. Jasarevic said.\n\nThe virus causes a pneumonialike illness, with coughing and fever in some people but not all. The severity matters: If there are cases with mild illness or no symptoms at all, they may go undetected, and those people will keep working, shopping and traveling, possibly infecting others.\n\nA milder illness has the potential to spread farther and cause longer-lasting outbreaks than one with more obvious symptoms, according to Dr. Mark R. Denison, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine who studies coronaviruses.\n\nCompared to SARS and MERS, the Wuhan illness so far does seem less severe, he said.\n\nSARS, which began in live-animal markets in China in 2002, quickly spread to dozens of countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 800. The virus is thought to have originated in bats and spread to civet cats that were being sold for consumption.\n\nThe civets spread the virus to humans, who infected one another through respiratory secretions and also exposure to feces.\n\nSARS often caused severe illness, so cases were detectable; aggressive public health measures, including quarantines and travel restrictions, helped stamp out the epidemic.\n\nBut the travel bans, not to mention widespread fear and distrust, took a heavy economic toll on China, and since then international authorities have become hesitant about taking drastic steps to quell outbreaks.\n\nMERS cases have been occurring in the Middle East since 2012, mainly in people who have been exposed to camels, which were most likely infected by bats. Human-to-human transmission does occur, and some spread has happened in hospitals.\n\nAs of November, there had been 2,494 cases of MERS in the last seven years, mostly in Saudi Arabia. The death rate is 34 percent, but may actually be lower if there are mild cases of the disease that have not been detected or counted.\n\nDr. Denison described the new Wuhan coronavirus as \"sort of a first cousin of SARS,\" more closely related to it than to MERS, based on its genetic sequence.\n\nResearchers do not know just how contagious the Wuhan coronavirus is. The first people to be infected are thought to have contracted it at a market in Wuhan that sold meat, fish and live animals.\n\nThat market has been shut down and disinfected. Which animal might have been carrying the virus is not yet known.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nInitially, the illness appeared to spread only from animals to people. Then, experts said there was evidence of \"limited\" human-to-human transmission. Now, more cases are emerging among people with no known exposure to the animal markets, and in medical staff members caring for infected patients.\n\n\"Now that you have a cluster of 14 health care workers infected, it suggests that the potential for spread is much greater,\" said Dr. Ian W. Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York, who has researched SARS and MERS.\n\n\"I saw film footage of a hospital lobby in Wuhan, and they are wearing full personal protective equipment from head to toe,\" he said. \"They are taking it very seriously. I still don't think this is as bad as SARS, but it's worse than they originally portrayed it.\"\n\nDr. Denison said that with both SARS and MERS, there were episodes in which individual patients became \"super-spreaders\" who infected many other people, for unknown reasons.\n\n\"That's a wild card we don't know, the capacity to have multiple transmissions from one person,\" Dr. Denison said. \"There was no evidence they had dramatically different virus.\"\n\nIt is possible, he said, that super-spreaders had received a high dose of the virus and had more of it to transmit. Alternatively, their immune systems might have not been able to control the virus, allowing it to multiply and spread extensively in their bodies, making them more contagious.\n\nAlthough no drugs have been approved specifically to treat coronavirus diseases, Dr. Denison said that in animal studies, an antiviral called remdesivir appeared effective. He has been working with other researchers to develop treatments.\n\nMr. Jasarevic said that antivirals were being tested against MERS, but that none had been approved yet.\n\nHow and why viruses that have peacefully coexisted with their animal hosts for a long time strike out for new territory -- us -- is not well understood.\n\nCoronaviruses often inhabit bats without harming them, and sometimes move into other animal species and from them to humans.\n\nIn places that bring multiple animal species together with lots of people -- like the food markets in Wuhan and in other parts of China that sell live mammals and birds, along with meat and fish -- viruses can pass back and forth between species, mutating as they go. Along the way, they may become able to infect humans.\n\n\"Coronaviruses have repeatedly shown an ability to probe across species and cause new animal and human diseases,\" Dr. Denison said.\n\nTo go successfully from animal hosts to people, the viruses need to adapt in several ways: They must gain the ability to invade human cells, evade the immune system, replicate inside the human body and spread to others.\n\nThe move is often described as \"jumping\" into humans, but that is an oversimplification, Dr. Denison said. \"The process it has to go through is more like high hurdles with a thousand hurdles along the way,\" he said.\n\nStill, the new outbreak does not greatly surprise him: \"This was a matter of not if, but when.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Says It Is Not an Emergency", "body": "Thursday's decision by the international health organization followed a delay on Wednesday.\n\nThe World Health Organization on Thursday declined to declare a global emergency as a deadly respiratory virus spread from China to at least five other countries.\n\nLess than a month after the first few cases of illness were reported in Wuhan, China, at least 600 people are known to have been infected, and at least 18 have died. Most who died had underlying health problems, and many were older than 60.\n\nCarried by travelers, the virus has also reached Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan and the United States. Investigators in other countries, including Mexico, are evaluating suspected cases.\n\nOfficials in China have closed transportation links from and within Wuhan, and are imposing travel restrictions on other affected cities. These steps have significantly escalated the country's efforts to contain the spread of the virus just days before the Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions travel in and out of the country.\n\nOnly five global public health emergency declarations have been made in the past:\n\nIn 2009, for pandemic influenza;\n\nIn 2014, for a polio resurgence in several countries;\n\nAgain in 2014, for the Ebola epidemic in West Africa;\n\nIn 2016, for the Zika virus epidemic;\n\nAnd in 2019, for an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe decisions are fraught. Health authorities do not want to cry wolf by raising alarms about an illness that turns out not to be severe -- or to ignore a real threat. If they act relatively early in an outbreak, as in this case, they may lack key information about the severity and contagiousness of the disease.\n\nThere are political and economic considerations as well. Declaring an emergency signals to governments that the situation is serious and that international help and cooperation are needed to contain the outbreak.\n\nControl measures may save not only lives, but money: the SARS epidemic, caused by a related coronavirus in 2002 and 2003, cost the global economy $30 billion to $100 billion, according to an article published Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nBut declaring an emergency may stigmatize the country struggling with an outbreak, and spur costly bans on travel and trade by other countries, even if health authorities discourage those actions.\n\n\"I think there is a general sense that we need to go back and revisit public health emergencies and what they mean,\" said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. \"I think it's not clear, do they or do they not bring more resources, or more controversy?\"\n\nThe new infection is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family that caused epidemics of SARS and MERS, which have killed hundreds of people in dozens of countries.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html", "title": "China Expands Virus Lockdown, Encircling 20 Million", "body": "WUHAN, China -- The authorities drastically expanded a travel lockdown in central China on Thursday, essentially penning in 20 million residents to contain a deadly virus that is overwhelming hospitals and fueling fears of a pandemic.\n\nThe draconian limits -- abruptly decreed during the Lunar New Year holiday, China's busiest travel season -- were an extraordinary step that underscored the ruling Communist Party's deepening fears about the outbreak of a little understood coronavirus. It has killed at least 18 people in China and sickened more than 600 in at least seven countries, including the United States, since the first case was reported three weeks ago.\n\nEven as the Chinese authorities imposed the new restrictions -- blocking expressways, cutting flights and warning residents to stay put -- experts warned that the country risked a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which broke out in China in late 2002 and spread for months while officials played down its severity.\n\nThe World Health Organization's emergency committee, meeting in Geneva on Thursday for the second consecutive day, said it was too early to declare an international health emergency though it would reconvene in 10 days or less to reassess the outbreak.\n\nBut in Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital of 11 million where the outbreak began, anxiety and anger prevailed as worried residents crowded into hospitals and teams of medical workers in hazmat suits sought to identify the infected.\n\n\"They can't take proper care of all the people here,\" said Sun Ansheng, a man in his 50s who was waiting outside a hospital while his wife was tested for the coronavirus, so named because of the spiky halo around the microorganism.\n\n\"The city government told us there was a virus, but they didn't explain enough what we should do,\" Mr. Sun said. \"They left it sounding too minor. Now look.\"\n\nThe images in Wuhan offered a jarring split-screen alongside the attempts by Chinese leaders in Beijing to project confident composure. President Xi Jinping led a toast in an ornate hall in Beijing to the Lunar New Year, which begins on Saturday, and he did not mention the crisis in his remarks to the cheerful crowd of officials and guests.\n\nMaps: Where the Wuhan Coronavirus Has Spread\n\nThe virus has sickened hundreds of people in Asia and at least one person in the United States.\n\nEven so, a sense of anxiety was deepening across China in spite of the holiday, with hospitals scrambling to cope with an influx of possibly infected patients and people lashing out online at the government. In Beijing, officials announced that they would temporarily close the Forbidden City.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the authorities imposed a travel lockdown in Wuhan, the industrial city of 11 million that is the epicenter of the outbreak. Airlines canceled hundreds of flights to Wuhan, leaving thousands of people stranded. Later in the day, officials said they would also halt public transportation in the nearby cities of Huanggang, Ezhou, Zhijiang and Chibi, which are together home to more than nine million residents.\n\nSome residents in Wuhan spoke speculatively of trying to skirt the blockade by driving on rural back roads to evade police checkpoints.\n\n\"It's serious, but not that serious,\" said Wang Mengkai, a worker in an electronics parts factory who was stuck at the Wuhan Railway Station, hoping to figure out a way to join his family in Henan Province for the Lunar New Year celebrations. \"If we can't get out on a train, we'll try putting together a car with a driver,\" he said.\n\nAnger and frustration spread among Wuhan residents lined up at hospitals seeking diagnosis and treatment for coughs and fevers. Most residents interviewed said they could see the logic of travel restrictions. But many accused officials of having failed to ensure that enough medical workers were properly trained, while medical workers reported shortfalls of critical protective gear such as masks and goggles.\n\n\"I'm willing to accept that we have to stay in Wuhan, O.K., but the medical care needs to keep up,\" said Yang Lin, 28, who had come seeking treatment for what she described as a cold. \"You shouldn't tell us we can't leave, and then give us second-rate medical care. That's unfair.\"\n\nThe Wuhan city government acknowledged that crowds were forming at hospitals, and it came under intensifying criticism from scientists and the public, who described the response as too little, too late.\n\nExperts said that the mass travel restrictions, while understandable, would do little to stop the spread of the virus outside China, as many infected people had already left Wuhan.\n\n\"The horse is already out of the barn,\" said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, who had assisted the Chinese authorities in the response to SARS.\n\nIn an unusually blunt rebuke, Dr. Guan Yi, a prominent Hong Kong scientist who also assisted in the SARS crisis, said officials had obstructed his efforts to investigate the outbreak during a trip to Wuhan this week.\n\n\"I consider myself a veteran in battles,\" he said in an interview published Thursday by the influential magazine Caixin, citing his experience with bird flu, SARS, and other outbreaks. \"But with this Wuhan pneumonia, I feel extremely powerless.\"\n\nOn Thursday, in what experts described as a somewhat reassuring sign, the Chinese authorities released details about the 18 people who have died in the outbreak, showing that the disease has so far largely killed older men, many with underlying health problems. But the 18th victim was the first to have died hundreds of miles from the Wuhan epicenter, punctuating the risk of fatal cases far from where the virus was first reported.\n\nExperts said the severity of the outbreak would depend on whether other epicenters develop, as happened during the SARS crisis. But they acknowledged that much remains unknown, including how easily the new virus spreads between people.\n\nIn Wuhan, hospitals appeared ill equipped to handle the sharp rise in patients.\n\nSeveral residents said they had gone from hospital to hospital and lined up for hours, only to be sent home with medicine and instructions to seek further treatment if symptoms persisted.\n\nDoctors told some patients of insufficient hospital beds and testing kits. Some residents worry officials are underreporting the number of people ill with the virus, although the government has warned of dire consequences for those who hide or delay reporting cases.\n\n\"The government did not fulfill its duty,\" Du Hanrong, 56, a retiree, said by telephone. \"They just are doing things hastily and carelessly.\"\n\nWuhan sits astride the mighty Yangtze River, and the restaurants and hotels along its banks -- usually busy in the holiday season -- were mostly shut. Retail streets were desolate, and the roads were often eerily empty.\n\nBut cars crowded around seven hospitals across Wuhan that have been designated as reception points for residents with high fevers that may have been caused by the new coronavirus. Some people waiting outside clinics in a drizzly rain said that their family members had lined up for much of the day to be checked by a doctor.\n\nAfter SARS broke out nearly 20 years ago, the Chinese government took steps to improve its public health system, including monitoring infectious diseases. But the lingering public distrust created by cover-ups of SARS and other health threats appears to have undercut those achievements.\n\nDali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, said that while the current response has benefited from China's improved technical capabilities since the SARS crisis, \"what I find astounding was how the Wuhan authorities consistently downplayed the seriousness of the situation.\"\n\nThe lessons from SARS, he said in an email, were \"that it's important to let the public know and get the public to modify their behavior.\"\n\nEven as anxiety grew, China's leaders maintained an unruffled face. The Communist Party's most influential news outlets did not feature the crisis, choosing instead to promote Mr. Xi's New Year speech and cheery reports about the holiday season.\n\nOn Thursday, China Central Television, the state broadcaster, treated the situation in Wuhan as a footnote in its evening newscast, one of the most watched television programs in China, airing a roughly one-minute report on the outbreak. Experts said Mr. Xi appeared to be trying to prevent a sense of panic and to limit criticism of the party's response.\n\n\"The top priority will be to keep coverage from asking more probing questions about how China's institutions have responded, questions that might lead to criticism of the government,\" said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, a group affiliated with the University of Hong Kong.\n\nSome internet users found ways around government censorship to criticize the response by local officials, saying on social media that they worried about a repeat of the SARS crisis. Many said they were also concerned about possible food shortages and higher prices on everyday goods.\n\nMao Shoulong, a professor of public administration at Renmin University in Beijing, said the Wuhan government had made a series of missteps that had eroded public confidence.\n\n\"They failed the test,\" Professor Mao said. \"They just copied the SARS situation, making small things turn into a big problem.\"\n\nChris Buckley reported from Wuhan, China, and Javier C.

Fears That Global Markets May Be Hit", "body": "HONG KONG -- The outbreak of a deadly disease in China has cast a pall over growth prospects for the world's second largest economy, raising fears about the global outlook if the mysterious coronavirus spreads or worsens.\n\nFinancial markets across Asia fell on Thursday, led by sharp drop in stocks in China, as investors pondered the potential impact of the coronavirus. The extent of its severity has become more clear over the past two days, as Chinese officials reported a surge in cases and a near doubling in the number of deaths to 17.\n\nOn Thursday, officials extended limits on movement in and out of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, to two nearby cities that millions more call home.\n\nThe uncertainty has put a palpable damper on Chinese life just before the Lunar New Year holiday -- typically a time of travel, shopping and gift-giving -- which begins on Friday. Train stations and airports were subdued as travelers changed plans for the weeklong holiday, and seven of the most anticipated film openings of the holiday season were postponed.\n\nOn the minds of many in China and around the world right now: Could this new virus cause the same kind of damage as the SARS epidemic, which killed 800 people in 2003?\n\nThe question is a crucial one beyond China, because the Chinese economy has for years been one of the world's most powerful growth engines. A stumble in China could hobble jobs and growth elsewhere.\n\nChina's growth in 2003 plunged briefly during the height of SARS but came roaring back in a time when global companies were building Chinese factories and exporting more and more goods abroad.\n\nToday, China's economy is bigger but is growing at its slowest pace in nearly three decades. It is grappling with problems like the trade war with the United States and a campaign to wean local governments and companies off their addiction to borrowing.\n\nIt also depends more on consumers like Mo Chen, 29, who is curtailing her holiday travel plans, to stay on the safe side. In 2003, the worst-hit sectors were transportation, retail and restaurants.\n\nMs. Mo, who works for an internet company in Shanghai, had been looking forward to traveling home to see her family in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, nearly 200 miles from Wuhan. But given the outbreak, she and her brother, who lives in the city of Hangzhou, decided not to go home. For Ms. Mo, it will be the first time she has not spent Lunar New Year with her parents.\n\nShe now plans to stock up on supplies and stay home, not even venturing out to meet friends or go to the movies. She also intends to skip a trip to the mall to buy new outfits, because nobody will be around to see her wear them. Her brother, meanwhile, is planning to buy pots and pans.\n\n\"He never cooks,\" she said. \"He always either eats out or eats at the company canteen. But last night our mom asked us to stock up on food, not go out and cook at home.\"\n\nFor now, the impact is not yet clear. The authorities seem to be responding faster to this outbreak than they did in 2003, but China's censors are erasing anything that veers from the official narrative. The new coronavirus appears to be less deadly than SARS, but it is difficult to detect, and the authorities' limiting of movement out of Wuhan came only after many people had set out for their holiday travels.\n\n\"It's going to depend on how China continues to be transparent with the international community,\" said Peter Levesque, the managing director of Modern Terminals, a port operator in Hong Kong. \"That's all business can ask for. The rest is unknown.\"\n\nWuhan itself is essential to commerce in its region of China, though the economic impact there is expected to be muted by the advent of the holiday. The city is a major national transport hub and has also become a key center for auto manufacturing, with factories that build cars for General Motors, Honda and many others, as well as dozens of auto parts makers.\n\nBut the effect on people across the country could be a more important factor.\n\nOver the long term, China wants its consumers to spend more. Beijing has sought to develop a consumer culture similar to that of the United States so that China's economy becomes less reliant on big construction and infrastructure projects that often receive government financing. But that shift makes China more vulnerable to events that spook shoppers.\n\nChinese consumer sentiment had already been bruised. Families spent the past year watching prices rise in grocery stores, thanks in large part to the outbreak of a pig disease that depleted much of China's pork supply. More families are saving rather than spending, and are worrying about the future.\n\n\"We will probably see a lot less domestic activity than we would normally see at this time of the year,\" said Julian Evans Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics.\n\n\"The concern is that it encourages people to cancel their travel plans, and it comes at a crucial time in terms of holiday travel and spending,\" he said.\n\nThe disease has struck during one of the year's busiest spending seasons. Box office sales during the Lunar New Year holiday last year set a record, reaching $860 million over the first six days of the holiday, according to Maoyan, a ticketing service owned by Alibaba.\n\nNew spending records will be harder to attain this year. Among the film debuts postponed on Thursday was \"Boonie Bears: The Wild Life,\" a cartoon about clever bears who clash with a hapless logger. In a message to fans on its social media account, the production company wrote, \"We don't want to see audience friends take any health risks,\" adding that it did not want to \"see that the epidemic may spread further.\"\n\nOther businesses in some parts of China have been temporarily closed. Major airlines, including Hong Kong's flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, have restricted flights to Wuhan. Companies urged employees to wear masks and not to travel.\n\nCompanies that were still offering services urged caution. Didi Chuxing, China's equivalent to Uber, sent a message to passengers saying that \"due to the virus, for the health and safety of everyone, both drivers and passengers should wear face masks.\"\n\nHong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese city that has roiled with anti-Beijing protests, could sustain yet another blow. The region is already in an economic recession after over half a year of antigovernment protests.\n\n\"If you look at those sectors of the economy, the retail and local businesses, they have already been sadly bruised by the protests last year,\" said Tara Joseph, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. \"This would just be an extra kick in the teeth that they don't need.\"\n\nBut, she added, \"it's too early to panic.\"\n\nCao Li contributed research.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

officials scrambled on Wednesday to contact more than a dozen people who may have been exposed to the United States' first case of Wuhan coronavirus, even as regulators sought to assure the public there was little risk from an illness that has rapidly spread across Asia, killing at least 17 people.\n\nThe patient, a man in his 30s who fell ill after traveling to China, has cooperated in helping public health workers trace his path from the Wuhan region of China to his home in Snohomish County, Wash., north of Seattle, health officials said.\n\nOfficials said they have been working to identify people who had close contact with the patient once his symptoms began to flourish. They do not believe he was symptomatic on his travel home, so the passengers on his flight have not been an area of focus.\n\nThey are, however, trying to contact other patients at the clinic the man visited on Sunday, a hospital official said. He reported then that he was sick and concerned about the prospect of a coronavirus infection.\n\n\"We're really pleased with the progress that we're making,\" John Wiesman, the secretary of health in Washington State, said at a news conference on Wednesday.\n\nHealth workers have reached out to 16 people who may have had close contact with the patient, all of them located in either Snohomish County or in Seattle's King County. That number may grow as the investigation continues, the officials said.\n\nThey said they planned to remain in daily contact with those people to monitor any possible symptoms but have not asked them to isolate themselves, under the assumption that this variation of coronavirus, which researchers are only beginning to understand, operates like other versions that transmit only once someone becomes symptomatic.\n\nOfficials believe that the virus is transmitted through the air by coughing and sneezing, by close personal contact such as touching an infected person, and from touching a surface with the virus on it before touching the mouth, nose or eyes.\n\nThe new virus emerged in China at the end of December and spread to other countries in Asia. The outbreak, which has sickened more than 540 people and left at least 17 dead, has triggered extensive protections around the globe, including extra screening and protocols for travelers coming from the Wuhan region in China.\n\nIn the United States, passengers from Wuhan are being funneled to airports in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, where screening stations have been set up.\n\nChinese authorities escalated their own actions, announcing plans to close off the city of Wuhan by canceling planes and trains scheduled to leave the area of more than 11 million people. The World Health Organization has been considering whether to declare an international emergency.\n\nIn Washington State, officials declined to discuss additional details about the patient or the specifics of his travel, saying they would publicly disclose them only if they had trouble making contact with people who might be at risk. While public health leaders said they saw minimal risk to the public, they also said the case in Snohomish County may not end up being the only one.\n\n\"We have our first case in the U.S.,\" Mr. Wiesman said. \"I would expect that at some point we're going to have more cases in the U.S.\"\n\nAfter the first American patient visited a clinic on Sunday, a few days after returning from China, doctors asked him to stay home and isolated as they worked with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test whether he had been infected by the new coronavirus.\n\nAfter confirming the illness, officials later coordinated with emergency medical technicians to bring the man to Providence Regional Medical Center in the city of Everett, where a containment unit had been built during the most recent Ebola outbreaks, said Dr. Jay Cook, the hospital's chief medical officer. The unit has a negative airflow to filter any air coming out of the room, and an adjacent room for workers to put on protective equipment if needed.\n\nDr. Cook said the patient was doing well under treatment by a team of caregivers that volunteered to handle patients who have illnesses of particular concern or that may be highly contagious. He said he was hopeful the patient could be discharged in the near future.\n\nAs the coronavirus has continued to spread through Asia, and as health officials try to determine how it spreads and how to contain it, regulators in the United States have sought to assure the public that there was little risk -- while acknowledging that there may be anxiety about the arrival of an illness that has drawn global attention.\n\n\"I think that's understandable given the amount of uncertainty and the new nature of this virus,\" Dr. Cook said.\n\nSymptoms of the virus include runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Officials said that anyone who feels sick should follow the usual protocols of staying home from work, covering coughs and washing hands. They said people who were ill after traveling to the Wuhan region should contact a health care provider.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

-- A little-understood coronavirus could mutate and spread further across China as hundreds of millions of people travel over the Lunar New Year holiday, one of the nation's top health officials warned on Wednesday.\n\nThe official, Li Bin, a deputy head of China's National Health Commission, said at a news conference in Beijing that the number of people infected by the coronavirus that causes pneumonia-like illness had risen to 440 by Tuesday night, up nearly tenfold from last week. Nine people have died.\n\nEvery year, Chinese travelers embark on the world's biggest annual human migration for the Lunar New Year, a weeklong holiday. That begins on Friday, when the country says farewell to the Year of the Pig and welcomes the Year of the Rat. Dr. Li said the huge tide of travel during the holiday could worsen the spread of the virus and make it more difficult to contain.\n\nAlready, though, the new virus has spread from Wuhan, a city of 11 million, across many parts of China -- and abroad, including to the United States -- aided by China's vast rail network and growing numbers of international travelers. The World Health Organization was expected to hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss whether to declare the outbreak an international health emergency, which would escalate the global response.\n\n[Here's a quick summation of what's known about the coronavirus outbreak.]\n\nMaps: Where the Wuhan Coronavirus Has Spread\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 400 people in Asia and one person in the United States.\n\nDr. Li endorsed the government's advice that people should minimize travel to and from Wuhan, the city in central China that is the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\n\"The possibility exists that the virus could mutate, and there are risks that the epidemic could spread further,\" Dr. Li said.\n\nReducing travel around Wuhan in particular, he added, would \"reduce the chances of the virus spreading.\"\n\n[Read about the first confirmed case of the Wuhan coronavirus in the United States.]\n\nDr. Li and other health officials leavened their warnings with reassurances that the Chinese government was taking firm steps to staunch the spread of the virus, and that it was disclosing information as quickly as possible. Many Chinese people hold bitter memories of 2003, when SARS -- a deadlier coronavirus with some similarities to the current outbreak -- spread widely after officials concealed the rising number of infections.\n\nOfficials in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, initially downplayed the risks from the new virus, which may have first passed from animals to humans in a market. But as cases increased, officials acknowledged that the virus has spread between humans, raising the risks of a widening epidemic.\n\nThe dangers could increase if the virus mutates in ways that make it easier to spread.\n\n\"The relationship between viruses and people is a cat-and-mouse game,\" Gao Fu, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at the news conference Wednesday. \"Up to this present stage, human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, and it has been disseminated in some communities.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType":

Them, but Do Masks Block Coronavirus?", "body": "They may help, but experts say it's more important to wash your hands.\n\nChinese authorities have encouraged people in the city of Wuhan to wear surgical masks in public to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nThe question is: do they work?\n\nMany infectious disease specialists say the cheap disposable masks, which cover the nose and mouth, may help prevent the spread of infections if they are worn properly and used consistently.\n\nBut there isn't much high quality scientific evidence on their effectiveness outside health care settings, experts say. Most of the best studies, which are randomized controlled trials, focused on how well surgical masks protect health care workers in hospitals from picking up infections from sick patients, and found that consistent use of them helped.\n\nDr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said surgical masks are really \"the last line of defense.\"\n\n\"We worry about people feeling they're getting more protection from the mask than they really are,\" she said. \"Washing your hands and avoiding people who are ill is way more important than wearing a mask.\"\n\nBecause surgical masks aren't fitted or sealed, they leave gaps around the mouth, \"so you're not filtering all of the air that comes in,\" she said.\n\nThe masks will, however, block most large respiratory droplets from other peoples' sneezes and coughs from entering your mouth and nose, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Coronaviruses are primarily spread through droplets, he said.\n\nThe bigger problem is that people don't use the masks properly. \"Most people will put their hand underneath the mask to scratch their face or rub their nose,\" bringing contaminants in contact with the nose and mouth, said Dr. Adalja. \"You can't take it off when you get a phone call.\"\n\nDr. Mark Loeb, an infectious disease specialist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, said a study during an outbreak of the SARS coronavirus found that any type of protection -- whether a mask or a respirator -- reduced the risk of infections in health care workers by about 85 percent.\n\n\"The most important message was that the risk was lower if they consistently used any mask,\" he said.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nThere is general agreement that infected patients who wear surgical masks are less likely to spread infection to others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has instructed hospitals to ask any patients who have a fever or respiratory illness, have recently traveled to Wuhan, or have come in contact with someone who has traveled there, to wear a surgical mask. The C.D.C. also recommends that health care workers wear a respirator, which filters out more particles than a mask, when they are around such patients.\n\nThe risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus in the United States -- where there is only one confirmed case -- is \"way too low to start wearing a face mask,\" said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, who is co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.\n\nBut washing hands -- - frequently and before eating -- is universally recommended. Hand sanitizer is effective against respiratory viruses. Experts also recommend washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, rubbing the hands together and ensuring all part of the hands -- the palms as well as the back of the hands -- are washed.\n\n\"It's also important to keep your hands away from your face,\" said Dr. Vaishampayan. \"Respiratory viruses don't infect through your skin, they infect through your mucous membranes: the eyes, nose and mouth.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roni_caryn_rabin@nytimes.com", "name": "Roni Caryn Rabin", "type":

The move is a significant escalation in the country's attempts to contain the virus as millions embarked on holiday travel for the Lunar New Year.\n\nThe first case in the United States was announced on Tuesday, as federal health officials confirmed that a Washington State man who had recently traveled to China had been hospitalized.\n\nBut much is still unknown about the newly identified virus, including how easily it is transmitted and how often it causes severe disease that can lead to death. Many of those who died in China were elderly individuals with pre-existing chronic conditions that may have made them more susceptible to the virus.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of what we know so far about the virus and the outbreak.\n\nWhat is a coronavirus?\n\nCoronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, which resemble the sun's corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which sickened thousands of people around the world -- and killed nearly 800 -- during a 2003 outbreak.\n\nWhere did the new coronavirus outbreak start?\n\nOn Jan. 8, The New York Times reported that Chinese researchers had identified a new coronavirus as the pathogen behind a mysterious illness that had sickened 59 people in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China.\n\nThe cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. The market was later shut down and disinfected.\n\nMaps: Where the Wuhan Coronavirus Has Spread\n\nThe virus has sickened hundreds of people in Asia and at least one person in the United States.\n\nHow many people have been infected, and how many have died?\n\nAt least 600 people are known to be infected, and at least 18 have died. Most of those infected lived in Wuhan or had recently traveled there. Of those who died, many were older men with pre-existing chronic health problems, like diabetes and high blood pressure, that made them susceptible to complications.\n\nAt least 17 of those who died were from Hubei, the Chinese province of which Wuhan is the capital. Of those, the youngest was a 48-year-old woman, and the eldest were two 89-year-old men who died on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nWhat is the source of the outbreak?\n\nAnimals are the most likely primary source of the outbreak -- but it is still not clear which animals. Past outbreaks of similar illnesses, including SARS, also are believed to have emerged from live animal markets. Another coronavirus, which causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, is transmitted to humans by camels.\n\nBut though the first patients were thought to have contracted the disease at the market, Chinese authorities say the illness can also be transmitted from person to person. A growing number of people, including medical staff caring for patients, have become infected. That makes the virus more difficult to contain.\n\nHas the virus spread to other countries?\n\nMost of the victims are in China, but the virus has spread to several other countries, including to five Asian countries -- Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Singapore -- as well as to the United States, where a man in his 30s who lives outside Seattle was recently found to have the illness. Health officials in Mexico are currently investigating a case involving a man who recently returned from Wuhan.\n\nHow is it transmitted?\n\nScientists still don't know exactly how the virus spreads, but it can be transmitted from person to person, which makes it a bigger risk than if it were transmitted only from animals to humans, said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, a director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.\n\nIt is most likely transmitted through coughing and sneezing, as with influenza and other respiratory viruses, said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\nThe Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed 198 confirmed cases in Wuhan. Researchers found that 22 percent had direct exposure to the meat market, and 32 percent had contact with people who had a fever or respiratory disease. But roughly half had neither been to the market nor had contact with anyone who was sick.\n\nOf the 198 infected, 25 have recovered, three have died and 170 are still being treated. Of the 170 being treated, 126 were described as having mild disease, 35 with severe disease and nine were said to be in critical condition. Sixteen health care workers were infected while caring for patients, the report said.\n\nHow dangerous is it?\n\nHealth officials around the world are alarmed, but it's hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus.\n\n\"When we get a new infectious disease, we learn about the most severe cases first, the top of the pyramid, as it were,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \"As the investigation goes on, we often learn there are less severely infected people, and even people who are infected who don't get sick at all.\"\n\nBy comparison, roughly 200,000 people are hospitalized with the flu each year in the United States, and about 35,000 people die.\n\nBut while some scientists say the virus appears to be less severe than other coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, it is not clear whether Chinese authorities have been fully transparent about the number of infections or the number of deaths, or even whether these figures are being carefully tracked.\n\n\"The information we know is changing rapidly,\" said Dr. Vaishampayan, of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. \"Whenever a new virus comes out, it takes a while to learn about it. There are going to be a lot of changes.\"\n\nWhat treatment is available?\n\nNo drugs are approved for the Wuhan coronavirus. The main treatment is supportive care, including making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, Dr. Vaishampayan said.\n\nPatients should rest and drink plenty of fluids \"while the immune system does its jobs and heals itself,\" she said.\n\nNo drugs have been approved for any coronavirus diseases, though an antiviral medication called remdesivir appears to be effective in animals.\n\nWhat are health authorities doing to contain the virus?\n\nChinese authorities closed off Wuhan on Thursday, canceling planes and trains out of the city of 11 million on the eve of a major holiday in China, and suspending bus, subway and ferry service within the city.\n\nThe restrictions are to be expanded to nearby cities, including Huanggang, a city of seven million about 30 miles east of Wuhan. The authorities have also shut rail stations in the nearby city of Ezhou and restricted travel in two other smaller cities, Chibi and Zhejiang.\n\nLarge public gatherings and performances are also banned in Wuhan, and the government announced that all residents were required to wear masks in public to help prevent the disease's spread.\n\nGovernments around the world have been screening passengers from Wuhan at ports of entry for signs of illness. North Korea temporarily barred foreign tourists, most of whom come from China. The World Health Organization is weighing declaration of an international emergency.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of infection?\n\nSymptoms of infection include fever, severe cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult. The incubation period -- the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms -- is believed to be about two weeks.\n\nI'm traveling to China. What can I do to protect myself?\n\nDr. Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that travelers to China should \"absolutely\" avoid live animal markets, and keep their distance from animals in rural areas as well. He reiterated that travelers should practice \"good hand hygiene\" -- washing hands frequently and avoiding touching their faces -- and that they should maintain a distance from anyone who is coughing and sneezing.\n\nTravelers should monitor their health upon return. If a cough or fever develops, call health providers before going in, so they prepare and put protective measures in place.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nIf you have a respiratory infection, wearing a mask helps protect the people around you from illness by reducing the risk of spreading the infection, experts say. Wearing a surgical mask may somewhat protect you from infection in a crowd if there is an outbreak, but, generally, surgical masks are not closefitting enough to filter all the air you are breathing in.\n\nExperts say you are better off washing your hands frequently throughout the day.\n\nAt the moment, the risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States -- where there is only one confirmed case so far -- \"is way too low to start wearing a face mask,\" Dr. Rabinowitz said. Even in Washington State, he said, \"The risk is very, very low to the general public.\"\n\nWhat are U.S. health officials doing to prevent an outbreak here?\n\nAmerican health officials are working closely with the World Health Organization and state and local health departments to monitor the situation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has activated an emergency response system, has dispatched workers to major airports to screen incoming passengers from Wuhan for signs of illness, and it has developed a diagnostic test for the virus, technically called the 2019-nCoV virus.\n\nThe C.D.C. has instructed hospitals around the country to ask patients who come in with fever or respiratory illness about recent travel to Wuhan or about contact with anyone who recently traveled to Wuhan. Health care providers are to isolate patients who may be infected and wear protective gear when treating them.\n\nA C.D.C. team is on the ground in Washington State providing assistance with the local investigation and helping to track down anyone who may have come in contact with the infected individual and may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n_______\n\nKaren Zraick contributed reporting.",

"Wuhan Beyond the Coronavirus: Steel, Cars and Spicy Noodles", "body": "The Chinese city of 11 million embodies the country's surge from grinding poverty to industrial powerhouse.\n\nIf Wuhan could be compared to an American city, it might be Pittsburgh -- a much bigger, much hotter Pittsburgh.\n\nWuhan, an industrial city in central China, straddles a river, the Yangtze. It is home to a troubled and declining steel industry. It is a university town filled with college students.\n\nThe comparisons don't go much further. Wuhan has a population of more than 11 million people, the equivalent of 36 Pittsburghs. In terms of college students alone, roughly one million are enrolled there, according to government figures. Summer temperatures can approach 100 degrees, with heavy humidity. Its traditional dish, and one of China's favorite noshes, is a pungent pasta concoction called reganmian, or \"hot dry noodles.\"\n\nWuhan is also the epicenter of a viral outbreak that is worrying the world. On Thursday, Chinese officials sharply limited travel to and from the city in an effort to contain a coronavirus that so far has killed 17 people and infected hundreds more. The restrictions hit the city at the peak of the travel period for the Lunar New Year holiday, meaning many residents may miss their families and loved ones this week.\n\nWuhan embodies China's rise as a global economic power, in all its complexities. Disposable income per person soared more than sixfold between 2002 and 2018, according to government figures compiled by CEIC Data, an information provider. The area is home to vast automotive factories making cars for General Motors, Nissan, Honda and other global and local brands. The city has become a popular destination for foreign investment.\n\nThe Chinese government thinks so highly of the city's image that Xi Jinping, the country's leader, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India there two years ago. The two walked along the city's East Lake, building what Chinese state-run media came to call the Wuhan spirit between the two regional rivals.\n\nThe boom has come with problems. Heavy pollution has provoked protests. Its streets are often clogged with traffic. Its steel factories, long a backbone of the local economy, have struggled along with the rest of the inefficient industry in China with overcapacity and pollution problems, leading Beijing to combine the state-owned local giant, Wuhan Steel, with another company.\n\nWuhan has long been a center of commerce in China thanks to its position along the Yangtze River, a major trade route, and it remains a key transportation hub, leading some in China to compare it to Chicago. It was also the site of one formative event in Chinese history: a military mutiny in 1911 that led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty and ushered in the Republic of China.\n\nWuhan held a special place in the heart of Mao Zedong, who famously took a swim in the Yangtze there in 1966 to show his vitality. This was at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, which tore Wuhan apart as it did other cities.\n\nAs China took off in the modern era, local leaders tried to burnish its image and show Wuhan taking part in the country's rise. They explored adopting a slogan and considered \"Great River, Great Lake, Great Wuhan\" and \"River Capital of the East, Livable Wuhan,\" among others.\n\nThey settled on \"Wuhan, Different Everyday!\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carlos_tejada@nytimes.com", "name": "Carlos Tejada", "type": "author",

We've also published a collection of essays about something we've all probably thought about at some point: quitting.\n\nImpeachment trial to begin in earnest\n\nAfter a ceremonial opening last week for the third presidential impeachment proceeding in U.S. history, the Senate gets down to business today, starting with what's expected to be a partisan debate over the rules. Here's what to expect when the trial begins at 1 p.m. Eastern.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, released draft rules on Monday. They would limit each side's arguments to 24 hours over two days and permit the Senate to decline to hear new evidence.\n\nMr. McConnell has said the rules are based on those used during President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999, but there are meaningful differences.\n\n\"The Daily\": Today's episode is about Mr. Clinton's trial.\n\nNews analysis: Mr. Trump's lawyers have said that the articles of impeachment -- for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- are invalid because they don't accuse him of an ordinary crime. It's an argument that plenty of scholars have rejected, our Washington correspondent explains.\n\nThe details: Read the brief that Mr. Trump's legal team submitted to the Senate on Monday. The House has until noon to file a rebuttal.\n\nRelated: The president is in Davos, Switzerland, today, for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. He received a frosty reception there in 2018, but this time he's likely to be accepted, if not embraced, writes our DealBook columnist, Andrew Ross Sorkin. (One reason: He may be in office for another four years.)\n\nBracing for climate change (just don't call it that)\n\nA $16 billion federal program to help states prepare for natural disasters reflects the complicated politics of global warming in the U.S., even as officials are increasingly forced to confront its effects.\n\nStates applying for funding must explain why they need the money and describe their \"current and future risks.\" When those include flooding, states must account for \"continued sea level rise,\" a consequence of warming.\n\nBut some conservative states have submitted proposals that mostly avoid mentioning climate change. Texas refers to \"changing coastal conditions\" and South Carolina talks about the \"destabilizing effects and unpredictability\" of three major storms in four years.\n\nOne exception is Florida, whose proposal calls climate change \"a key overarching challenge.\"\n\nRelated: Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old climate activist, is expected to criticize inaction by the world's business and political leaders during a speech today in Davos, Switzerland. Read a transcript of her planned remarks.\n\nAnother angle: Australia's biggest mining company announced today that coal output was down because of smoke from wildfires, a crisis exacerbated by climate change, which is caused in no small part by the burning of coal. The irony was not lost on many Australians.\n\nHow Boeing's role in a crash 'got buried'\n\nWhen a Boeing 737 crashed near Amsterdam in 2009, killing nine people, Dutch pilots were blamed. But mistakes by the manufacturer -- including design choices and faulty safety assessments -- also contributed, documents and interviews show.\n\nA Times review of evidence from the accident, some of it previously confidential, revealed striking parallels with two recent crashes of a newer model, the 737 Max, and similar pushback from the company and American safety officials.\n\nAn expert commissioned by the Dutch Safety Board to analyze the 2009 crash said it represented \"a sentinel event that was never taken seriously.\" His study was never made public.\n\nResponse: Boeing declined to address detailed questions from The Times. In a statement, the company pointed to differences between the 2009 accident and the Max crashes. \"These accidents involved fundamentally different system inputs and phases of flight,\" the company said.\n\nIf you have 20 minutes, this is worth itStories of walking away\n\nIs there a more exciting and complicated phrase than \"I quit\"?\n\nOur collection of 21 first-person narratives discusses quitting all sorts of things, including jobs, sex, the presidential campaign and even the task of writing about quitting.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nFear of pandemic: Australian officials said today that they would begin screening passengers on flights from Wuhan, the Chinese city where a deadly coronavirus that has infected more than 250 people originated.\n\nVirginia gun rights rally: More than 20,000 people, many of them armed, gathered in Richmond to protest gun control proposals. The authorities had been braced for violence, but the police reported no major incidents.\n\nSnapshot: Above, the Cosmic Ray Research Station in Armenia. In its heyday, more than 100 scientists worked there tracking high-energy particles from space. Physics has mostly moved on, but the station persists -- a ghost observatory that is maintained for long stretches by two technicians and a cook.\n\nLate-night comedy: The hosts wondered about the defense strategy for President Trump's legal team. \"Release a live bat in the Senate chamber, then scatter,\" Jimmy Fallon suggested.\n\nWhat we're reading: This piece in Taste about a food specialty familiar to only a small subset of Italian-Americans. \"It has come to my attention that some of you do not know the first blessed thing about lard bread,\" tweeted our food critic Pete Wells. \"Max [Falkowitz] is here to guide you into the light of lardy knowledge.\"\n\nNow, a break from the news\n\nCook: Turn pantry staples into vegetarian skillet chili. (Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter has more recommendations.)\n\nGo: \"Emojiland\" is an Off Broadway musical set inside a smartphone with a cast of, you guessed it, emojis. It's \"big-hearted and comforting,\" our critic writes.\n\nWatch: Ruth Negga, an Ethiopian-Irish actress, is set to play Hamlet in Brooklyn. She spoke to The Times about the role and her next project, a film adaptation of a 1920s novel about passing for white.\n\nSmarter Living: Should you unpack your suitcase when you travel? Whatever your choice, pack thoughtfully.\n\nAnd now for the Back Story on ...Cocktails\n\nA hundred years ago this month, the U.S. embarked on an official prohibition on the \"manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors\" anywhere within the country.\n\nIt didn't go well.\n\nBootlegging liquor operations proliferated, as did the illicit bars known as speakeasies. The drink of choice: the cocktail, which spread out the hooch and could disguise bad flavors. The boom far outlasted Prohibition, which ended after 13 years. Sidecar, anyone?\n\nDave Wondrich, a drinks historian, tracked down the source of the word \"cocktail.\" In the second edition of his landmark reconstruction of mixed drinks, \"Imbibe!,\" he notes that prospective horse sellers in England would give old or droopy specimens a rectal dose of ginger to make them cock their tails for a younger, zippier appearance.\n\nFrom there it was just a short jump to the zingy drinks that made humans perk up, at least at the start of their alcoholic forays.\n\nThat's it for this briefing.

Here's the sign-up.)\n\nGood morning.\n\nWe're covering expanding travel restrictions in China, a ruling by the United Nations' top court to protect Rohingya Muslims, and the retirement of Eli Manning, the Giants quarterback.\n\nThe continuing case against President Trump\n\nHouse impeachment managers will resume their arguments against the president this afternoon, a day after they accused him of pressuring Ukraine in an effort \"to cheat\" in the 2020 election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Representative Adam Schiff argued that Mr. Trump's conduct was exactly what the framers of the Constitution had in mind when they devised impeachment.\n\nRelated: Democrats rejected a suggestion that they might call Joe Biden's son, Hunter, to testify in exchange for an appearance by John Bolton, the former national security adviser.\n\nNews analysis: In the trial's opening days, \"the House managers have focused on the facts,\" one of our Washington correspondents writes. \"The defense team has focused instead on the process.\"\n\nCloser look: The Times asked 81 Americans from nearly 30 states what they thought. Most grasped the basics of the case and had strong opinions, if not always the ones you'd expect.\n\nWhat's next: The House managers have used about a third of their allotted 24 hours for opening arguments, after which the White House team gets its turn. If senators later vote to subpoena witnesses and documents, the trial could go deep into February. If they don't, it could be over before Mr. Trump's State of the Union speech on Feb. 4.\n\nTravel restrictions affect millions in China\n\nThe authorities today banned travel from three cities in central China, including Wuhan, the epicenter of a deadly respiratory virus that has spread to at least four other countries, including the U.S. Here are the latest updates.\n\nExperts said the scale of the shutdown was unprecedented. The three cities involved have a combined population of nearly 20 million.\n\nThe details: The virus has killed at least 17 and sickened more than 570. Here are maps of its spread.\n\nWhat's next: The Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions travel across China, begins Friday. Epidemiologists fear it could make the outbreak harder to contain.\n\nU.S. to lift water pollution controls\n\nThe Trump administration is set to finalize a rule today that would remove Obama-era protections for streams, wetlands and other bodies of water.\n\nFor the first time in decades, landowners and property developers could dump pollutants such as pesticides and fertilizers directly into many waterways, and destroy or fill in wetlands for construction.\n\nLast month, a government advisory board of scientists said the new rule \"neglects established science,\" but farmers and fossil fuel groups supported the change.\n\nGo deeper: The measure, to be implemented in the coming weeks, is the latest step in the Trump administration's push to repeal or weaken environmental regulations.\n\nHow Jeff Bezos' iPhone was hacked\n\nA message sent in 2018 from an account belonging to the Saudi crown prince concealed code that probably let hackers into the Amazon chief's device, according to an analysis that Mr. Bezos commissioned.\n\nMr. Bezos has sought to find out who penetrated the phone since early 2019, when he said The National Enquirer's parent company had threatened to release private photographs and texts.\n\nYesterday: Two United Nations experts said the hacking was an effort to \"influence, if not silence\" critical coverage of Saudi Arabia by The Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos owns. Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident writer killed by Saudi agents in 2018, was a Post columnist.\n\nResponse: The Saudi Embassy in Washington called the accusations about Mr. Bezos' cellphone \"absurd.\"\n\nIf you have 7 minutes, this is worth itThe gentrification of Paris\n\nWhen the brothers Ali and Amar Sitayeb, above, opened a convenience store in 1984 in the Marais, Paris's historic Jewish quarter, the neighborhood had plenty of textile and metal factories.\n\nToday, their shop is among the independent businesses being swept away by gentrification. A Japanese-owned lingerie chain will take the space.\n\n\"How is a bra going to replace my orange juice?\" asked a retiree who has lived next to the shop for two decades.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nAir tanker crash in Australia: Three firefighters from the U.S. were killed today when an aircraft being used to battle bush fires crashed south of the capital, Canberra.\n\nRuling for Rohingya: The International Court of Justice at The Hague said today that Myanmar must take action to protect Rohingya Muslims after what the country's accusers have called a campaign of genocide.\n\nTrump at March for Life: President Trump plans to address the annual rally of anti-abortion demonstrators on Friday in Washington. He would be the first sitting president to do so.\n\nOnly dogs allowed: The Department of Transportation is proposing to ban all service animals except dogs aboard U.S. flights. Airlines would also no longer have to accommodate emotional support animals.\n\nSnapshot: Above, Eli Manning in 2008, after leading the New York Giants to an upset victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. After 16 seasons with the Giants, the quarterback is scheduled to announce his N.F.L. retirement on Friday.\n\nChild prodigy: A 3-year-old in Britain has become the youngest current member of Mensa, a society whose membership rules require an I.Q. in the top 2 percent of the population. (The youngest ever was 2 years and 4 months.)\n\nLate-night comedy: Representative Adam Schiff repeatedly invoked the nation's founders at the impeachment trial. \"Schiff quoted Hamilton so many times today, he was nominated for five Tony Awards,\" Jimmy Kimmel said.\n\nWhat we're reading: This explainer on a measure of deliciousness, from Taiwan Business Topics: \"Today's lesson,\" writes our food correspondent Kim Severson, \"is understanding the Q factor in Taiwanese food. It's good-chewy.\"\n\nNow, a break from the news\n\nCook: If tres leches cake is not enough, add three more milks.\n\nWatch: Twenty-five years after the release of \"Before Sunrise,\" the film's stars and creators spoke to The Times about how they made movie magic out of a tiny budget and capricious trains.\n\nRead: \"Leadership Strategy and Tactics,\" by the former Navy SEAL Jocko Willink, is a No. 1 debut on our advice, how-to and miscellaneous best-seller list.\n\nSmarter Living: Here's how to tip hotel workers.\n\nAnd now for the Back Story on ...The front line of an outbreak\n\nJavier C. Hern\u00e1ndez, a correspondent in our Beijing bureau, is reporting this week from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak. Mike Ives, on the Briefings team, spoke with Javier via Slack, a messaging service.\n\nHi, Javier. What's the mood in Wuhan right now?\n\nWalking the streets, you definitely feel a sense of urgency is spreading. Lots of people are wearing masks and avoiding big crowds. All of this is happening in the midst of the Lunar New Year holiday, so it has forced many families to rethink their plans. People are canceling dinners, staying home from work and hunkering down.\n\nIt must be hard to avoid big crowds in a city of 11 million.\n\nYes, it's almost impossible to avoid crowds in a modern Chinese city. But Wuhan is trying to push people to take more precautions. When you get in a cab now, there are reminders about opening the window and wearing a mask. Some of the famous street markets are totally empty, surrounded by signs warning about the virus.\n\nAre you hearing any common sentiments in your interviews?\n\nSeveral people told me about their memories of the SARS crisis of 2003, which killed hundreds of people in China. They're worried this could erupt into a full-blown epidemic. Of course, others say they're not very concerned and have faith that China can beat this. One common theme is people say they want the Chinese government to speak honestly about the severity of the outbreak -- something that didn't happen during SARS.\n\nAre you taking any specific precautions, like wearing a mask?\n\nYes, at the advice of experts, my colleague Elsie Chen and I are washing our hands regularly and avoiding meat markets and hospital wards. We are wearing masks all the time. It's a bit odd having that kind of barrier when you're interviewing people on the street. But we've found that it is quickly becoming the norm in Wuhan. There are even videos now circulating of people giving New Year's toasts with their masks on!\n\nThat's it for this briefing. See you next time.\n\n-- Chris\n\nThank you\n\nMark Josephson, Eleanor Stanford and Chris Harcum provided the break from the news.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/health/china-virus.html", "title": "As New Virus Spreads From China, Scientists See Grim Reminders", "body": "Less than a month after the first few cases of a new respiratory illness were reported in Wuhan, China, travelers have carried the virus to at least four other countries, including the United States. More than 500 people are known to have been infected, at least 17 have died -- and the world is bracing itself for what might come next.\n\nOn Wednesday, experts at the World Health Organization decided to postpone until Thursday a decision on whether the current outbreak constitutes a \"public health emergency of international concern,\" a label given to serious public health events that endanger international public health\" and \"potentially require a coordinated international response.\"\n\nA vote by W.H.O.'s emergency committee was split down the middle, its chairman said, and the group concluded that it did not have enough information to make a decision.\n\n\"The decision about whether or not to declare a public health emergency of international concern is one I take extremely seriously, and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence,\" Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, W.H.O.'s director general, said at news briefing.\n\nAdding that a W.H.O. team was in China gathering information, he said, \"We will have much more to say tomorrow\n\nBut even as the W.H.O. debated its decision, officials in China began closing transportation links from and within Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. The move was a significant escalation in the country's attempts to contain the spread of the virus as the Lunar New Year approaches and holiday travel commences.\n\nDr. Tedros and W.H.O. officials at the briefing said they had not advised China to close Wuhan, but nonetheless expressed support for the decision, saying it could protect other parts of China and other countries.\n\nPublic health officials around the world are on alert because the new infection is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family that caused outbreaks of SARS and MERS, killing hundreds of people in dozens of countries.\n\nThe W.H.O. has already advised governments to be prepared for the disease, to be vigilant and ready to test anyone with symptoms like cough and fever who has traveled to affected regions. Air travel is expected to surge as the Lunar New Year approaches this weekend.\n\nMore important than an emergency declaration is the need for more data on the outbreak, said Jennifer B. Nuzzo of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nScientists still do not have enough information about the severity of the disease, she said.\n\n\"I want to see from the emergency committee all the information on the table and an assessment of what the risk really is,\" Dr. Nuzzo said. \"To me, that's far more important than their declaration.\"\n\nOne purpose of an emergency declaration is to draw world attention to an outbreak, so that governments can prepare and also provide needed help.\n\n\"There's already a high level of global attention,\" Dr. Nuzzo said, adding that she was not sure how much a declaration would have changed things.\n\nSeveral countries have already begun screening travelers from China for fever and cough. Airports in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco last week started to screen arriving flights from Wuhan, and airports in Atlanta and Chicago will begin doing so this week.\n\n\"Data shows that entry screening requires a tremendous amount of resources and is not tremendously effective,\" Dr. Nuzzo said.\n\nNorth Korea has suspended tourism because of the outbreak, according to Reuters.\n\nMaps: Where the Wuhan Coronavirus Has Spread\n\nThe virus has sickened hundreds of people in Asia and at least one person in the United States.\n\nImportant questions about the outbreak are still unanswered, and W.H.O.'s expert committee now must grapple with significant unknowns.\n\n\"We don't know how many people are infected,\" said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the W.H.O. \"The more you test, the more you will find people who are infected. We don't know if there are asymptomatic cases. If they are asymptomatic, are they contagious?\"\n\nBroad studies to test for evidence of infection, past and present, would give a true picture of how many people have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe virus causes a pneumonialike illness, with coughing and fever in some people but not all. The severity matters: If there are cases with mild illness or no symptoms at all, they may go undetected, and those people will keep working, shopping and traveling, possibly infecting others.\n\nA milder illness has the potential to spread farther and cause longer-lasting outbreaks than one with more obvious symptoms, according to Dr. Mark R. Denison, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine who studies coronaviruses.\n\nCompared to SARS and MERS, the Wuhan illness so far does seem less severe, he said.\n\nSARS, which began in live-animal markets in China in 2002, quickly spread to dozens of countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing nearly 800. The virus is thought to have originated in bats and spread to civet cats that were being sold for consumption.\n\nThe civets spread the virus to humans, who infected one another through respiratory secretions and also exposure to feces.\n\nSARS often caused severe illness, so cases were detectable, Dr. Denison said; aggressive public health measures, including quarantines and travel restrictions, helped stamp out the epidemic.\n\nBut the travel bans, not to mention widespread fear and distrust, took a heavy economic toll on China, and since then international authorities have become hesitant about taking drastic steps to quell outbreaks.\n\nMERS cases have been occurring in the Middle East since 2012, mainly in people who have been exposed to camels, which were most likely infected by bats. Human-to-human transmission does occur, and some spread has happened in hospitals.\n\nAs of November, there had been 2,494 cases of MERS in the last seven years, mostly in Saudi Arabia. The death rate is 34 percent, but may actually be lower if there are mild cases of the disease that have not been detected or counted.\n\nDr. Denison described the new Wuhan coronavirus as \"sort of a first cousin of SARS,\" more closely related to it than to MERS, based on its genetic sequence.\n\nResearchers do not know just how contagious the Wuhan coronavirus is. The first people to be infected are thought to have contracted it at a market in Wuhan that sold meat, fish and live animals.\n\nThat market has been shut down and disinfected. Which animal might have been carrying the virus is not yet known.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nInitially, the illness appeared to spread only from animals to people. Then, experts said there was evidence of \"limited\" human-to-human transmission. Now, more cases are emerging among people with no known exposure to the animal markets, and in medical staff members caring for infected patients.\n\n\"Now that you have a cluster of 14 health care workers infected, it suggests that the potential for spread is much greater,\" said Dr. Ian W. Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York, who has researched SARS and MERS.\n\n\"I saw film footage of a hospital lobby in Wuhan, and they are wearing full personal protective equipment from head to toe,\" he said. \"They are taking it very seriously. I still don't think this is as bad as SARS, but it's worse than they originally portrayed it.\"\n\nDr. Denison said that with both SARS and MERS, there were episodes in which individual patients became \"super-spreaders\" who infected many other people, for unknown reasons.\n\n\"That's a wild card we don't know, the capacity to have multiple transmissions from one person,\" Dr. Denison said. \"There was no evidence they had dramatically different virus.\"\n\nIt is possible, he said, that super-spreaders had received a high dose of the virus and had more of it to transmit. Alternatively, their immune systems might have not been able to control the virus, allowing it to multiply and spread extensively in their bodies, making them more contagious.\n\nAlthough no drugs have been approved specifically to treat coronavirus diseases, Dr. Denison said that in animal studies, an antiviral called remdesivir appeared effective. He has been working with other researchers to develop treatments.\n\nMr. Jasarevic said that antivirals were being tested against MERS, but that none had been approved yet.\n\nHow and why viruses that have peacefully coexisted with their animal hosts for a long time strike out for new territory -- us -- is not well understood.\n\nCoronaviruses often inhabit bats without harming them, and sometimes move into other animal species and from them to humans.\n\nIn places that bring multiple animal species together with lots of people -- like the food markets in Wuhan and in other parts of China that sell live mammals and birds, along with meat and fish -- viruses can pass back and forth between species, mutating as they go. Along the way, they may become able to infect humans.\n\n\"Coronaviruses have repeatedly shown an ability to probe across species and cause new animal and human diseases,\" Dr. Denison said.\n\nTo go successfully from animal hosts to people, the viruses need to adapt in several ways: They must gain the ability to invade human cells, evade the immune system, replicate inside the human body and spread to others.\n\nThe move is often described as \"jumping\" into humans, but that is an oversimplification, Dr. Denison said. \"The process it has to go through is more like high hurdles with a thousand hurdles along the way,\" he said.\n\nStill, the new outbreak does not greatly surprise him: \"This was a matter of not if, but when.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

know.\n\nGood morning.\n\nWe're covering the spread of a mysterious virus across Asia, why important details of a Boeing crash from a decade ago were suppressed and growing restrictions on plastic in China.\n\nViral ailment spreads in Asia, feeding fears of pandemic\n\nThe coronavirus causing a new respiratory illness is now capable of spreading from person to person, a prominent Chinese scientist said on Monday, as the authorities reported a third death and doubled the number of cases from a day earlier, including in Beijing and southern China for the first time.\n\nCases have also been reported in Japan, South Korea and Thailand.\n\nWith hundreds of millions of people in China expected to travel for the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins Friday, public health officials are working to forestall a major outbreak. Some experts have suggested that there are probably far more cases of the illness than China's authorities have disclosed.\n\nHow Boeing's role in a deadly crash 'got buried'\n\nWhen a Boeing 737 crashed near Amsterdam in 2009, killing nine people, the accident was blamed on Dutch pilots. But Boeing's mistakes also contributed, including its design choices and faulty safety assessments.\n\nA review by The New York Times of evidence from the 2009 accident, some of it previously confidential, reveals striking parallels with recent Boeing crashes that killed hundreds -- and resistance by a team of Americans, including Boeing and federal officials, to a full airing of findings that later proved relevant to Boeing's Max plane.\n\nAn expert commissioned by the Dutch Safety Board to analyze the 2009 crash said it \"represents such a sentinel event that was never taken seriously.\" His study was never made public.\n\nComparisons: In the 2009 and Max accidents, the failure of a single sensor caused systems to misfire, with catastrophic results, and Boeing did not provide pilots with information that could have helped them react to the malfunction.\n\nQuotable: The Turkish Airlines crash \"should have woken everybody up,\" said one aviation safety expert.\n\nTimes editorial board endorses two candidates\n\nThe board, which is separate from the Times newsroom, announced that it's supporting both Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe dual endorsement is a departure from convention. The board says that it is meant to address the party's \"realist\" and \"radical\" models.\n\nWhile arguing that President Trump must be defeated, the board did not take a position on which was the best path forward for Democrats, writing that both \"warrant serious consideration.\" Read the endorsement here, which distills the themes and challenges of the election coming in November.\n\nBackground: The board's 15 members met with nine candidates and released full transcripts of their interviews.\n\nBehind the scenes: The endorsement process has typically been opaque, but this year, our TV show \"The Weekly\" was invited in. Our deputy editorial page editor explained the process and the decision to open it up to cameras.\n\nAustralia can't catch a break\n\nThousands of people were left without power as baseball-size hailstones pummeled major cities in the country's southeast over the past two days, the latest turn in a summer of extreme weather.\n\nAlthough a drought -- along with the devastating wildfires it has fed -- is far from over, thunderstorms have lashed Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne.\n\nWhat's next: Meteorologists warned that the storms would continue for the next few days. Hot and windy conditions are expected to return to many parts of New South Wales later this week.\n\nIf you have 20 minutes, this is worth itHelping to exploit Angola's wealth\n\nIsabel dos Santos, above center, Africa's richest woman, often took cuts of her country's wealth through decrees signed by her father. Global banks, bound by strict rules about politically connected clients, largely declined to work with her family.\n\nBut global consulting firms embraced her business, helping her amass a fortune in a country hobbled by corruption and park it abroad, according to a trove of documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with The Times. The vast empire stretches from Hong Kong to the U.S.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nIndia: As the country seeks to rein in foreign technology companies and international news outlets, its leaders have pressured Jeff Bezos, who owns one of each: Amazon and The Washington Post.\n\nHow warm was your town?: Scientists said that 2019 was the second-warmest year on record, and an AccuWeather database of 3,500 cities around the world showed that more than 80 percent experienced higher-than-normal average temperatures last year.

There are arguments for both.\n\nAnd now for the Back Story on ...Cocktails\n\nA hundred years ago this month, the U.S. embarked on a 13-year official prohibition on the \"manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors\" anywhere within the country.\n\nIt didn't go well.\n\nBootlegging liquor operations proliferated, as did the illicit bars known as speakeasies. And the drink of choice: the cocktail, which spread out the hooch or disguised its sometimes bad flavors. The boom far outlasted Prohibition. Sidecar, anyone?\n\nDave Wondrich, a drinks historian, tracked down the source of the word \"cocktail.\" In the second edition of his landmark reconstruction of mixed drinks, \"Imbibe!,\" he notes that prospective horse sellers would give old or droopy specimens a rectal dose of ginger to make them cock their tails -- a younger, zippier appearance.\n\nFrom there it was just a short jump to the zingy drinks that made humans perk up, at least at the start of their alcoholic forays.\n\nThat's it for this briefing.

The deadly disease rippled across the world 17 years ago, abetted by a Chinese government that covered up its spread. As the scope of it became clear, China's journalists, intellectuals and other critics helped shame Beijing into opening up about the problem.\n\n\"SARS has been our country's 9/11,\" said Xu Zhiyuan, then a young newspaper columnist and a fierce critic of the government's handling of SARS, in a 2003 interview with The New York Times. \"It has forced us to pay attention to the real meaning of globalization.\"\n\nToday, China faces the spread of another mysterious disease, a coronavirus, which so far has killed 17 people and infected more than 570. And while Beijing's response has improved in some ways, it has regressed in others. It is censoring criticism. It is detaining people for spreading what it calls \"rumors.\" It is suppressing information it deems alarming.\n\nThough China's censors are busily scrubbing the Chinese internet, the country's online community is registering its disappointment and alarm over Beijing's handling of the new virus that has spread since December from the city of Wuhan to other countries, even the United States.\n\n\"I thought SARS would force China to rethink its governance model,\" Mr. Xu, now a video talk show host, wrote on social media on Tuesday, also posting a screenshot of his 2003 quote in The Times. \"I was too na\u00efve.\"\n\nMaps: Where the Wuhan Coronavirus Has Spread\n\nThe virus has sickened hundreds of people in Asia and at least one person in the United States.\n\nIn many ways, China has changed for the better since the SARS epidemic. Its economy has grown eightfold. It has built more skyscrapers, subways and high-speed rail lines than any other country. Its tech companies rival Silicon Valley's giants. A more responsive bureaucracy provides more people with health care, social services and even quality-of-life improvements like parks.\n\nWhen it comes to handling diseases, the public health system has greatly improved. Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is also home to one of the most advanced epidemic disease research laboratories in the world.\n\nThose improvements have come at a price. The government has tightened its grip on the internet, the media and civil society. It has deeper pockets and a greater ability to control the flow of information across the country.\n\nAs a result, many of the media outlets, advocacy groups, activists and others who held the government accountable in 2003 have been silenced or sidelined.\n\n\"The system is successful in that it destroyed the people with integrity, the institutions with credibility and a society capable of narrating its own stories,\" Mr. Xu said on social media. \"What's left is an arrogant power, a bunch of messy information and many fragile, isolated and angry individuals.\"\n\nEven as the new virus spread through Wuhan, the government took pains to keep up appearances.\n\nThe first case was reported Dec. 8. As the disease spread, Wuhan officials insisted that it was controlled and treatable. The police questioned eight people who posted on social media about the virus, saying they had spread \"rumors.\"\n\nOn Saturday, two days before Wuhan told the world about the severity of the outbreak, it hosted a potluck banquet attended by more than 40,000 families so the city could apply for a world record for most dishes served at an event. On the day it broke the news to the world, it also announced that it was distributing 200,000 free tickets to residents for festival activities during the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins this Saturday.\n\nThe central government backed Wuhan's officials. Wang Guangfa, a prominent government respiratory expert, told the state broadcaster China Central Television on Jan. 10 that the Wuhan pneumonia was \"under control\" and mostly a \"mild condition.\" Eleven days later, he confirmed to Chinese media that he might have contracted the virus himself during an inspection in Wuhan.\n\nRecognizing an outbreak can take time, and China is not the first government caught flat footed by a disease.\n\nBut the choices made by government officials had an impact on a major commercial and transportation hub. Wuhan is a city of 11 million people, including nearly one million college students from across the country. By the time it disclosed the seriousness of the outbreak, the 40-day Lunar New Year travel season, when Chinese people take an estimated three billion trips combined, had already begun.\n\nPeople might have made different decisions had websites and headlines described growing worries. Instead, they traveled. On Tuesday, all five confirmed cases in Beijing were people who had traveled to Wuhan in January for business, study or leisure.\n\nUntil a week ago, some people in China called it the \"patriotic virus.\" Cases appeared in Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan and elsewhere in Asia. No other Chinese city but Wuhan reported infection cases. It was not until the Hong Kong news media reported over the weekend that the virus had been found in other cities did officials elsewhere come forward.\n\nSome critics see parallels to SARS. In 2003, the Guangzhou newspaper Southern Metropolis Daily first reported the SARS outbreak. A military doctor, Jiang Yanyong, came forward with what he knew. Only then did officials act.\n\n\"The way this virus came into the public view is the same as that of SARS 17 years ago,\" said Rose Luqiu, an assistant journalism professor who covered SARS as a reporter for the Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television.\n\nMany of those brave voices in 2003 are gone. Like almost all Chinese media outlets that were active in the 1990s and 2000s, the Southern Metropolis Daily has lost its freedom to pursue coverage that holds local governments, if not Beijing, accountable. Only a few mainland news media outlets are covering the current crisis critically, and then only with an analytical tone.\n\nIn 2003, Phoenix Television called Ms. Luqiu, then a star reporter, back from Iraq to report on SARS in Beijing. She shadowed the newly appointed Beijing mayor, Wang Qishan, for a week to cover how the government dealt with the crisis. Mr. Wang later became the vice president of China.\n\nThat kind of openness is unimaginable now. Last week, when a group of Hong Kong journalists went to the Wuhan hospital that took in most coronavirus patients, the police detained them for a few hours. They were asked to delete their TV footage and hand in their phones and cameras for inspection.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Luqiu wrote an article for qq.com, the news site owned by the internet giant Tencent, about the measures the Hong Kong government has taken in dealing with the virus. The article was deleted 10 hours later.\n\nDr. Jiang, the military doctor who became a whistle-blower in 2003, has been put under periodic house arrest and forbidden to visit the United States to collect a human rights award. He is also portrayed as a bad role model. A multiple-choice question posed by a test-prep school in 2017 asked about Dr. Jiang's decision. The correct answer was B: It was wrong because it harmed the interests of the nation, the society and the community and should be subject to legal punishment.\n\nChina's disclosures have improved in many ways since SARS. The government admitted the problem faster. Beijing officials have shown determination to be more transparent. A top party committee said on Tuesday that it would not tolerate any efforts to hide infections.\n\n\"Whoever deliberately delays or conceals reporting for the sake of their own interests will be forever nailed to history's pillar of shame,\" the committee said in a post on WeChat. The post was later deleted.\n\nBut when the government is the only source of information, wise advice and valuable clues can be lost. A police bureau in eastern Shandong Province posted on the Twitter-like social media platform Weibo on Wednesday that it had detained four residents who spread rumors that there was a suspected coronavirus patient in the district. In that environment, others dare not speak out.\n\n\"The authorities are sending a signal, which is that only the government agencies can talk about the epidemic,\" Yu Ping, a former Southern Metropolis Daily reporter, wrote on his personal blog. \"All other people should just shut up.\"\n\n\"It's not public disclosure,\" Mr. Yu added. \"It's a naked information monopoly.\"", "source":

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-markets-coronavirus-sars.html", "title": "China's Omnivorous Markets Are in the Eye of a Lethal Outbreak Once Again", "body": "LANGFANG, China -- The typical market in China has fruits and vegetables, butchered beef, pork and lamb, whole plucked chickens -- with heads and beaks attached -- and live crabs and fish, spewing water out of churning tanks. Some sell more unusual fare, including live snakes, turtles and cicadas, guinea pigs, bamboo rats, badgers, hedgehogs, otters, palm civets, even wolf cubs.\n\nThe markets are fixtures in scores of Chinese cities, and now, for at least the second time in two decades, they are the source of an epidemic that has spread fear, taxed the Communist Party bureaucracy and exposed the epidemiological risks that can spawn in places where humans and wildlife converge.\n\nThe novel coronavirus that has already killed at least 42 and sickened more than 1,370 in China and around the world is believed to have spread from exactly one of these places: a wholesale market in Wuhan, a city in central China, where vendors legally sold live animals from stalls in close quarters with hundreds of others.\n\n\"This is where you get new and emerging diseases that the human population has never seen before,\" said Kevin J. Olival, a biologist and vice president of research with EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit research organization, who has tracked previous outbreaks.\n\nWhile the exact path of the pathogen has not yet been established, government officials and scientists said the new contagion had ominous similarities with the outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in late 2002, which killed nearly 800 people and sickened thousands more around the world.\n\nNow, as the government struggles to contain public anger over the outbreak, it is facing calls to do more to regulate or even ban the sale of wildlife -- and growing questions about why so little has changed in the 17 years since SARS.\n\nThat disease was ultimately traced to a coronavirus that jumped from bats to Asian palm civets, a catlike creature prized as a delicacy in southern China, and then to humans involved in the wildlife trade there. According to officials and scientists, the new virus also appears to have originated in bats and made the jump to another mammal, though which one is not yet clear.\n\nThe latest outbreak -- the scope of which is still unfolding -- has led to calls inside and outside of China for better regulations or even an end to this kind of culinary adventurism. While turtle and boar meat are not uncommon in Chinese restaurants, game meats such as civet cats, snakes or pangolins tend to be considered specialties only in some regions. Their consumption is driven as much by the desire to flaunt wealth as by a mix of superstition and belief about the health benefits of wildlife.\n\nOnce the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was identified as the most likely source of this outbreak in December, the authorities promptly closed it, though it was not clear what happened to the animals that had been for sale there. Officials announced only on Wednesday that they had banned the sale of wild animals throughout the province. Two other provinces, Henan and Inner Mongolia, also imposed suspensions on the trade this past week.\n\nOn Friday, officials from three national agencies announced tighter controls, including a suspension nationally of the sale and transport of animals possibly linked to the new coronavirus. The statement specified only badgers and bamboo rats, a species of rodent found in southern China that lives in (and eats) bamboo thickets. Both had been advertised for sale in the market in Wuhan.\n\nThe flurry of government action came after an unusual outpouring of public sentiment against the trade of live animals. A campaign on Weibo, the social media platform, drew 45 million views with the hashtag #rejectgamemeat.\n\n\"Eating game does not cure impotence or have healing powers,\" Jin Sichen, a television presenter in Nanjing, a city in southeastern China, wrote on his Weibo page on Wednesday. \"Game not only doesn't cure disease, it can also make you, your family, friends and even more people sick.\"\n\n\"One must be mentally sick to eat game in order to show off and flaunt,\" Mr. Jin added.\n\nA group of 19 Chinese scholars also called on the government to do more to regulate the trade and the public to stop eating wild animals.\n\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society, an advocacy organization based in New York, called for a global ban on the commercial sale of wildlife, especially in markets like those in China, saying that the latest outbreak proved the public health threat.\n\nChristian Walzer, the organization's executive director of health, said that the astonishing diversity of wild animals in markets like these, packed in small cages in crowded market stalls, created a perfect laboratory for the unintentional incubation of new viruses that can enter human cells. Viruses can be spread through saliva, blood or feces.\n\n\"Each animal is a package of pathogens,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n\nBut some Chinese consumers ascribe traditional medicinal benefits to the animals. Vendors and even officials in state news media have touted wildlife as alternative sources of protein and sources of revenue in impoverished regions.\n\nAn article by the Xinhua news agency last fall, for example, said that farming bamboo rats was helping to lift people out of poverty in Guangxi, another southern province.\n\nWorries about meat supplies surged last year over the outbreak of African swine fever, which led to the killing of 40 percent of the country's pigs. Production of domesticated livestock on the country's farms is, compared to the sale of wildlife, subjected to far more regulation and inspection. Outbreaks still occur, but they are identified more quickly.\n\nPart of the problem with the wildlife trade is that there is far less regulation, despite the greater risk of live animals infecting each other and people, especially in markets that can be unsanitary.\n\nMr. Walzer said that one problem with the legal production of some species is that it can blur the lines between those raised in captivity and those captured in the wild, where unknown viruses have existed for years without contact with humans.\n\n\"It's a public health hazard, not only in China but everywhere,\" he said.\n\nAt the peak of the SARS outbreak in 2003, the authorities banned the sale of civets and culled the existing stocks, but within months they ended the ban and trade had resumed as before.\n\n\"It is driven by interests,\" Qin Xiaona, president of the Capital Animal Welfare Association, an advocacy organization in Beijing, said of the current outbreak. \"Many people profit from the wildlife trade today.\"\n\nThe trafficking of some wildlife is prohibited, including endangered pangolins, which are prized for their scales and meat, but China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration allows people to raise 54 different animals, birds, reptiles and insects, including muskrat, chipmunks, ostriches, emus and centipedes.\n\nOn Taobao, a popular Chinese online shopping platform, all manner of live wildlife can be had. A baby badger costs 1,300 renminbi, or $187. A farmer from Hunan, the province directly south of Hubei, sells civets, the source of SARS, for the equivalent of $215 each -- discounted to $200 if one buys 500 or more.\n\nAt the sprawling, semi-enclosed market in Langfang, an electronics manufacturing hub south of Beijing, one vendor advertised a live crocodile ($550) and a porcupine ($115).\n\nIn Wuhan, the authorities have not given details about all the animals that were on sale in the market linked to the new coronavirus. People on social media circulated a photograph of a price list for a variety of animals purported to be sold by a vendor in the market, but its authenticity could not be confirmed.\n\nAccording to a medical blog posted on WeChat, health authorities in Wuhan visited the market in September and inspected eight vendors selling frogs, snakes and hedgehogs, among other animals. All were licensed to sell wildlife, and no violations were found.\n\nDespite the spread of the virus around the country, a Hong Kong television network, I-Cable News Channel, found scores of wild animals still for sale on Wednesday at a market in Qingyuan, a city in Guangdong, the province where SARS originated.\n\nThe epidemic has now put sellers on the defensive.\n\n\"Are you sure it is eating wild animals that has caused the epidemic?\" said Zheng Ming, the sales manager of a company selling animals in Yichang, a city 180 miles west of Wuhan. Until the ban on sales announced this past week, he sold porcupines, civets, guinea pigs and bamboo rats among others.\n\n\"We observe the law,\" he said. \"This is a completely legal business.\"\n\nJames Gorman contributed reporting from New York.
