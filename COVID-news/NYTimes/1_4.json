Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, but only if a scientific panel decides that the benefits justify the risks.\n\nSome scientists are eager to pursue these studies because they may show, for example, how a bird flu could mutate to more easily infect humans, or could yield clues to making a better vaccine.\n\nCritics say these researchers risk creating a monster germ that could escape the lab and seed a pandemic.\n\nNow, a government panel will require that researchers show that their studies in this area are scientifically sound and that they will be done in a high-security lab.\n\nThe pathogen to be modified must pose a serious health threat, and the work must produce knowledge -- such as a vaccine -- that would benefit humans. Finally, there must be no safer way to do the research.\n\n\"We see this as a rigorous policy,\" Dr. Collins said. \"We want to be sure we're doing this right.\"\n\nIn October 2014, all federal funding was halted on efforts to make three viruses more dangerous: the flu virus, and those causing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\nBut the new regulations apply to any pathogen that could potentially cause a pandemic. For example, they would apply to a request to create an Ebola virus transmissible through the air, said Dr. Collins.\n\nThere has been a long, fierce debate about projects -- known as \"gain of function\" research -- intended to make pathogens more deadly or more transmissible.\n\nIn 2011, an outcry arose when laboratories in Wisconsin and the Netherlands revealed that they were trying to mutate the lethal H5N1 bird flu in ways that would let it jump easily between ferrets, which are used to model human flu susceptibility.\n\nTensions rose in 2014 after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention accidentally exposed lab workers to anthrax and shipped a deadly flu virus to a laboratory that had asked for a benign strain.\n\nThat year, the N.I.H. also found vials of smallpox in a freezer that had been forgotten for 50 years.\n\nWhen the moratorium was imposed, it effectively halted 21 projects, Dr. Collins said. In the three years since, the N.I.H. created exceptions that funded ten of those projects. Five were flu-related, and five concerned the MERS virus.\n\nThat virus is a coronavirus carried by camels that has infected about 2,100 people since it was discovered in 2012, and has killed about a third of them, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nCritics of such research had mixed reactions. \"There's less than meets the eye,\" said Richard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist and bioweapons expert at Rutgers University.\n\nAlthough he applauded the requirement for review panels, he said he would prefer independent panels to government ones.\n\nHe also wanted the rules to cover all such research rather than just government-funded work, as well as clearer minimum safety standards and a mandate that the benefits \"outweigh\" the risks instead of merely \"justifying\" them.\n\nMarc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist who directs the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard School of Public Health, called review panels \"a small step forward.\"\n\nRecent disease-enhancing experiments, he said, \"have given us some modest scientific knowledge and done almost nothing to improve our preparedness for pandemics, and yet risked creating an accidental pandemic.\"\n\nTherefore, he said, he hoped the panels would turn down such work.\n\nMichael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he believed some laboratories could do such work safely, but wanted restrictions on what they could publish.\n\n\"If someone finds a way to make the Ebola virus more dangerous, I don't believe that should be available to anybody off the street who could use it for nefarious purposes,\" he said.\n\n\"Physicists long ago learned to distinguish between what can be publicly available and what's classified,\" he added, referring to nuclear weapons research. \"We want to keep some of this stuff on a need-to-know basis.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francis Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microorganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebola virus disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthrax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biological warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_T.H._Chan_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard T.H.

A pandemic -- an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents -- may well have global consequences, despite the extraordinary travel restrictions and quarantines now imposed by China and other countries, including the United States.\n\nScientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however, so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause. But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted between humans.\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found.\n\n\"It's very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,\" said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.\n\n\"But will it be catastrophic? I don't know.\"\n\nIn the last three weeks, the number of lab-confirmed cases has soared from about 50 in China to more than 17,000 in at least 23 countries; there have been more than 360 deaths.\n\nBut various epidemiological models estimate that the real number of cases is 100,000 or even more. While that expansion is not as rapid as that of flu or measles, it is an enormous leap beyond what virologists saw when SARS and MERS emerged.\n\nWhen SARS was vanquished in July 2003 after spreading for nine months, only 8,098 cases had been confirmed. MERS has been circulating since 2012, but there have been only about 2,500 known cases.\n\nThe biggest uncertainty now, experts said, is how many people around the world will die. SARS killed about 10% of those who got it, and MERS now kills about 1 of 3.\n\nThe 1918 \"Spanish flu\" killed only about 2.5% of its victims -- but because it infected so many people and medical care was much cruder then, 20 to 50 million died.\n\nBy contrast, the highly transmissible H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic of 2009 killed about 285,000, fewer than seasonal flu normally does, and had a relatively low fatality rate, estimated at .02%.\n\nThe mortality rate for known cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has been running about 2%, although that is likely to drop as more tests are done and more mild cases are found.\n\nIt is \"increasingly unlikely that the virus can be contained,\" said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now runs Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit devoted to fighting epidemics.\n\n\"It is therefore likely that it will spread, as flu and other organisms do, but we still don't know how far, wide or deadly it will be.\"\n\nIn the early days of the 2009 flu pandemic, \"they were talking about Armageddon in Mexico,\" Fauci said. (That virus first emerged in pig-farming areas in Mexico's Veracruz state.) \"But it turned out to not be that severe.\"\n\nAn accurate estimate of the virus' lethality will not be possible until certain kinds of studies can be done: blood tests to see how many people have antibodies, household studies to learn how often it infects family members, and genetic sequencing to determine whether some strains are more dangerous than others.\n\nClosing borders to highly infectious pathogens never succeeds completely, experts said, because all frontiers are somewhat porous. Nonetheless, closings and rigorous screening may slow the spread, which will buy time for the development of drug treatments and vaccines.\n\nOther important unknowns include who is most at risk, whether coughing or contaminated surfaces are more likely to transmit the virus, how fast the virus can mutate and whether it will fade out when the weather warms.\n\nThe effects of a pandemic would probably be harsher in some countries than in others. While the U.S. and other wealthy countries may be able to detect and quarantine the first carriers, countries with fragile health care systems will not. The virus has already reached Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines and rural Russia.\n\n\"This looks far more like H1N1's spread than SARS, and I am increasingly alarmed,\" said Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"Even 1% mortality would mean 10,000 deaths in each million people.\"\n\nOther experts were more cautious.\n\nDr. Michael Ryan, head of emergency responses for the World Health Organization, said in an interview with STAT News on Saturday that there was \"evidence to suggest this virus can still be contained\" and that the world needed to \"keep trying.\"\n\nDr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virus-hunter at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who is in China advising its Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that although the virus is clearly being transmitted through casual contact, labs are still behind in processing samples.\n\nBut life in China has radically changed in the last two weeks. Streets are deserted, public events are canceled, and citizens are wearing masks and washing their hands, Lipkin said. All of that may have slowed down what lab testing indicated was exponential growth in the infection.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how accurate tests done in overwhelmed Chinese laboratories are. On the one hand, Chinese state media have reported test kit shortages and processing bottlenecks, which could produce an undercount.\n\nBut Lipkin said he knew of one lab running 5,000 samples a day, which might produce some false-positive results, inflating the count. \"You can't possibly do quality control at that rate,\" he said.\n\nAnecdotal reports from China, and one published study from Germany, indicate that some people infected with the Wuhan coronavirus can pass it on before they show symptoms. That may make border-screening much harder, scientists said.\n\nEpidemiological modeling released Friday by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control estimated that 75% of infected people reaching Europe from China would still be in the incubation periods upon arrival, and therefore not detected by airport screening, which looks for fevers, coughs and breathing difficulties.\n\nBut if thermal cameras miss victims who are beyond incubation and actively infecting others, the real number of missed carriers may be higher than 75%.\n\nStill, asymptomatic carriers \"are not normally major drivers of epidemics,\" Fauci said. Most people get ill from someone they know to be sick -- a family member, a co-worker or a patient, for example.\n\nThe virus' most vulnerable target is Africa, many experts said. More than 1 million expatriate Chinese work there, mostly on mining, drilling or engineering projects. Also, many Africans work and study in China and other countries where the virus has been found.\n\nIf anyone on the continent has the virus now, \"I'm not sure the diagnostic systems are in place to detect it,\" said Dr. Daniel Bausch, head of scientific programs for the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, who is consulting with the WHO on the outbreak.\n\nSouth Africa and Senegal could probably diagnose it, he said. Nigeria and some other countries have asked the WHO for the genetic materials and training they need to perform diagnostic tests, but that will take time.\n\nAt least four African countries have suspect cases quarantined, according to an article published Friday in The South China Morning Post. They have sent samples to France, Germany, India and South Africa for testing.\n\nAt the moment, it seems unlikely that the virus will spread widely in countries with vigorous, alert public health systems, said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\n\"Every doctor in the U.S. has this top of mind,\" he said. \"Any patient with fever or respiratory problems will get two questions. 'Have you been to China? Have you had contact with anyone who has?' If the answer is yes, they'll be put in isolation right away.\"\n\nAssuming the virus spreads globally, tourism to and trade with countries besides China may be affected -- and the urgency to find ways to halt the virus and prevent deaths will grow.\n\nIt is possible that the Wuhan coronavirus will fade out as weather warms. Many viruses, like flu, measles and norovirus, thrive in cold, dry air. The SARS outbreak began in winter, and MERS transmission also peaks then, though that may be related to transmission in newborn camels.\n\nFour mild coronaviruses cause about a quarter of the nation's common colds, which also peak in winter.\n\nBut even if an outbreak fades in June, there could be a second wave in the fall, as has occurred in every major flu pandemic, including those that began in 1918 and 2009.\n\nBy that time, some remedies might be on hand, although they will need rigorous testing and perhaps political pressure to make them available and affordable.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)In China, several antiviral drugs are being prescribed. A common combination is pills containing lopinavir and ritonavir with infusions of interferon, a signaling protein that wakes up the immune system.\n\nIn the U.S., the combination is sold as Kaletra by AbbVie for HIV therapy, and it is relatively expensive. In India, a dozen generic makers produce the drugs at rock-bottom prices for use against HIV in Africa, and their products are WHO-approved.\n\nAnother option may be an experimental drug, remdesivir, on which the patent is held by Gilead. The drug has not yet been approved for use against any disease. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that it works against coronaviruses, and Gilead has donated doses to China.\n\nSeveral U.S. companies are working on a vaccine, using various combinations of their own funds, taxpayer money and foundation grants.\n\nAlthough modern gene-chemistry techniques have made it possible to build vaccine candidates within just days, medical ethics require that they then be carefully tested on animals and small numbers of healthy humans for safety and effectiveness.\n\nThat aspect of the process cannot be sped up, because dangerous side effects may take time to appear and because human immune systems need time to produce the antibodies that show whether a vaccine is working.\n\nWhether or not what is being tried in China will be acceptable elsewhere will depend on how rigorously Chinese doctors run their clinical trials.\n\n\"In God we trust,\" Schaffner said. \"All others must provide data.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Declares Global Emergency as Wuhan Coronavirus Spreads", "body": "The announcement came as nearly 8,000 cases have been reported worldwide, almost all of them in mainland China.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared on Thursday that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak was a global health emergency, acknowledging that the disease now represents a risk beyond China, where it emerged last month.\n\nThe decision reversed the organization's decision just a week ago to hold off such a declaration.\n\nSince then, W.H.O. officials said, thousands of new cases in China and clear human-to-human transmission in several other countries -- now including the United States -- warranted a reconsideration of that decision by the agency's expert committee.\n\nThe W.H.O.'s declaration -- officially called a \"public health emergency of international concern\" -- does not have the force of law. But it serves notice to all United Nations member states that the world's top health advisory body thinks the situation is grave.\n\nGovernments then make their own decisions about whether to close their borders, cancel flights, screen people arriving at airports or take other protective measures.\n\nDeclaring emergencies also adds urgency to any W.H.O. appeal for money. Thus far, that is hardly relevant: The countries most affected -- China, Japan, Germany, South Korea, the United States and Vietnam -- can afford to wage their own battles against the virus.\n\nBy contrast, the Democratic Republic of Congo has needed large infusions of cash and medical expertise to fight an ongoing Ebola outbreak, and the need for money was one of the reasons the W.H.O. declared an international emergency in that case, even though Ebola has not spread outside of Congo except in a few patients who briefly entered Uganda.\n\nLast week, the committee was divided. Declaring emergencies is always a hard decision, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director general, because closed borders and canceled flights lead to personal hardships for millions of healthy people near the epicenter and can cause massive economic disruption.\n\nIn the worst cases, supplies of food and medicine can run short and panic can spread, threatening to do more damage than the disease does.\n\nThe agency has lavishly praised China's aggressive response to the virus.\n\nChina effectively walled off Hubei Province, stranding more than 30 million people, at the height of the New Year holidays -- an act tantamount to quarantining the American Midwest at Christmastime. (No American politician or public health official would dare be Grinch enough to attempt such a move, especially after only about 100 deaths in a swath of the country where thousands die each day of other illnesses.)\n\nDr. Tedros, who met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday, said Mr. Xi had led \"a monumental national response,\" and that he was \"struck by the determination of Chinese leadership\" and by how much Mr. Xi personally understood about the outbreak.\n\nChina said on Thursday that another 38 people had died from the disease, bringing the total to 170. Nearly 8,000 cases have been reported worldwide, almost all of them in mainland China.\n\nOn Thursday, Russia closed its 2,600-mile border with China and stopped all trains except for one between Moscow and Beijing.\n\nWithin China, some medical experts have questioned their country's response, arguing that local officials could have put in place stricter travel restrictions before the virus spilled beyond the central city of Wuhan. The country has now confirmed cases in every province and region.\n\nThe W.H.O. has made such declarations just five times since its power to do so was established in 2005: for the pandemic influenza in 2009, a polio resurgence in 2014, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa that same year, the Zika virus outbreak in 2016 and an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year.\n\nDr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and one of the discoverers of the Ebola virus and the presence of AIDS in Africa, said he personally considered the outbreak an emergency and found the process flawed.\n\n\"It is time for the W.H.O. to change its all-or-nothing, binary approach to declaring a PHEIC,\" he said, referring to the emergency declaration. \"In every emergency, there is a spectrum of alert levels, rather than 'PHEIC or not PHEIC.'\"\n\nDr. Tedros said the same thing at a news conference on Wednesday, suggesting that the agency might want to go to a graduated green-yellow-red system.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_ramzy@nytimes.com", "name": "Austin Ramzy",

"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/china-coronavirus-contain.html", "title": "How Bad Will the Coronavirus Outbreak Get? Here Are 6 Key Factors", "body": "While the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. To avoid any viral illness, experts advise washing your hands frequently and avoiding your office or school when you're sick. Most healthy people don't need masks, and hoarding them may contribute to shortages for health workers who do need them, experts say.\n\nIt seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS.\n\nThe scale of an outbreak depends on how quickly and easily a virus is transmitted from person to person. While research has just begun, scientists have estimated that each person with the Wuhan coronavirus could infect somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures.\n\nThat would make the new virus roughly as contagious as SARS, another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 and was contained after it sickened 8,098 people and killed 774. Respiratory viruses like these can travel through the air, enveloped in tiny droplets that are produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes.\n\nThese droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. That makes the virus harder to get than pathogens like measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis, which can travel a hundred feet through the air. But it is easier to catch than H.I.V. or hepatitis, which spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nIf each person infected with the Wuhan coronavirus infects two to three others, that may be enough to sustain and accelerate an outbreak, if nothing is done to reduce it.\n\nHere's how that works. In the animation below, a group of five infected people could spread the virus to about 368 people over just five cycles of infection.\n\nCompare that with a less contagious virus, like the seasonal flu. People with the flu tend to infect 1.3 other individuals, on average. The difference may seem small, but the result is a striking contrast: Only about 45 people might be infected in the same scenario.\n\nBut the transmission numbers of any disease aren't set in stone. They can be reduced by effective public health measures, such as isolating sick people and tracking individuals they've had contact with. When global health authorities methodically tracked and isolated people infected with SARS in 2003, they were able to bring the average number each sick person infected down to 0.4, enough to stop the outbreak.\n\nHealth authorities around the world are expending enormous effort trying to repeat that.\n\nSo far, the number of cases outside China has been small. But in recent days, cases have turned up in several countries, including the United States, with people who have not visited China. And the number of cases within China has accelerated, far surpassing the rate of new SARS cases in 2003:\n\nIt's hard to know yet. But the mortality rate is probably less than 3 percent, much less than SARS.\n\nThis is one of the most important factors in how damaging the outbreak will be, and one of the least understood.\n\nIt's tough to assess the lethality of a new virus. The worst cases are usually detected first, which can skew our understanding of how likely patients are to die. About a third of the first 41 patients reported in Wuhan had to be treated in an I.C.U., many with symptoms of fever, severe cough, shortness of breath and pneumonia. But people with mild cases may never visit a doctor. So there may be more cases than we know, and the death rate may be lower than we initially thought.\n\nAt the same time, deaths from the virus may be underreported. The Chinese cities at the center of the outbreak face a shortage of testing kits and hospital beds, and many sick people have not been able to see a doctor.\n\n\"There's still a lot of uncertainty about what this virus is like and what it is doing,\" said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who was at the frontlines of the Canadian response to SARS.\n\nEarly indications suggest the mortality rate for this virus is considerably less than another coronavirus, MERS, which kills about one in three people who become infected, and SARS, which kills about one in 10. All of the diseases appear to latch on to proteins on the surface of lung cells, but MERS and SARS seem to be more destructive to lung tissue. As of Jan. 31, fewer than one in 40 of the people with confirmed infections had died. Many of those who died were older men with underlying health problems.\n\nHere's how the new coronavirus compares with other infectious diseases:\n\nPathogens can still be very dangerous even if their fatality rate is low, Dr. McGeer said. For instance, even though influenza has a case fatality rate below one per 1,000, roughly 200,000 people end up hospitalized with the virus each year in the United States, and about 35,000 people die.\n\nPossibly between 2 to 14 days, allowing the illness to go undetected.\n\nThe time it takes for symptoms to appear after a person is infected can be vital for prevention and control. Known as the incubation period, this time can allow health officials to quarantine or observe people who may have been exposed to the virus. But if the incubation period is too long or too short, these measures may be difficult to implement.\n\nSome illnesses, like influenza, have a short incubation period of two or three days. People may be shedding infectious virus particles before they exhibit flu symptoms, making it almost impossible to identify and isolate people who have the virus. SARS, however, had an incubation period of about five days. In addition, it took four or five days after symptoms started before sick people could transmit the virus. That gave officials time to stop the virus and effectively contain the outbreak, Dr. McGeer said.\n\nOfficials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the Wuhan coronavirus has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days. But it is still not clear whether a person can spread the virus before symptoms develop, or whether the severity of the illness affects how easily a patient can spread the virus.\n\n\"That concerns me because it means the infection could elude detection,\" said Dr. Mark Denison, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.\n\nThe virus spread quickly because it started in a transportation hub.\n\nWuhan is a difficult place to contain an outbreak. It has 11 million people, more than New York City. On an average day, 3,500 passengers take direct flights from Wuhan to cities in other countries. These cities were among the first to report cases of the virus outside China.\n\nWuhan is also a major transportation hub within China, linked to Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities by high-speed railways and domestic airlines. In October and November of last year, close to two million people flew from Wuhan to other places within China.\n\nChina was not nearly as well-connected in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. Large numbers of migrant workers now travel domestically and internationally -- to Africa, other parts of Asia and Latin America, where China is making an enormous infrastructure push with its Belt and Road Initiative. This travel creates a high risk for outbreaks in countries with health systems that are not equipped to handle them, like Zimbabwe, which is facing a worsening hunger and economic crisis.\n\nOver all, China has about four times as many train and air passengers as it did during SARS outbreak:\n\nChina has taken the unprecedented step of imposing travel restrictions on tens of millions of people living in Wuhan and nearby cities. But experts warned that the lockdown may have come too late and limited access to food and medicine. Wuhan's mayor acknowledged that five million people had left the city before the restrictions began, in the run-up to the Lunar New Year.\n\n\"You can't board up a germ. A novel infection will spread,\" said Lawrence O. Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \"It will get out; it always does.\"\n\nThe W.H.O. has praised China's efforts, but critics fear lockdown measures may not be enough.\n\nIn addition to closing off transportation, officials shut down a market in Wuhan selling live poultry, seafood and wild animals, which was thought to be the origin of the coronavirus, and later suspended the trade of wild animals nationwide. Schools have been closed, Beijing's Great Wall is off limits and tourist packages from China have been halted. World Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus.\n\nBut the measures have also had unintended effects. Residents in Wuhan who are unwell must walk or cycle for miles to get to hospitals. There, many complain that they are being turned away because of shortages of hospital beds, staff and supplies that have been made worse by the lockdown.\n\nUntil recently, researchers abroad were also concerned by the fact that China was not admitting experts who could help track the virus and prevent its spread.\n\nOn Thursday, the W.H.O. declared the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency, acknowledging that the disease represents a risk beyond China.\n\nHealth officials in the United States and other countries have started screening passengers arriving at airports and isolating those who appear to be ill. Several countries -- including Kazakhstan, Russia and Vietnam -- have temporarily restricted travel and visas to and from China. But critics fear that these measures will not be enough.\n\nA vaccine is still a year away -- at minimum.\n\nA coronavirus vaccine could prevent infections and stop the spread of the disease. But vaccines take time.\n\nAfter the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.) By the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.\n\nNow, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline even further. Researchers have already studied the genome of the new coronavirus and found the proteins that are crucial for infection. Scientists from the National Institutes of Health, in Australia and at least three companies are working on vaccine candidates.\n\n\"If we don't run into any unforeseen obstacles, we'll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months,\" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nDr. Fauci cautioned that it could still take months, and even years, after initial trials to conduct extensive testing that can prove a vaccine is safe and effective. In the best case, a vaccine may become available to the public a year from now.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They were originally told that they would be detained for at least 72 hours, and possibly 14 days. Two weeks is thought to be the upper limit of the incubation period; if symptoms don't start by then, a person can be cleared as not infected.\n\nUntil Friday, the detention was unofficial and the group stayed at the base voluntarily, except for one member, who tried to leave on Wednesday and was quarantined by Riverside County.\n\nFederal law authorizes the C.D.C. to impose quarantines, but the power is rarely used. The last large-scale quarantine was imposed during the 1918-1919 Spanish flu pandemic.\n\nSo far, six people in the United States are known to be infected with the virus. Five had been to Wuhan and the sixth is the husband of one of those patients. He had not traveled to Wuhan, but contracted the illness from his wife after she returned home to Chicago. The other cases have been in Washington State, California and Arizona.\n\nMore than 100 people in the United States are being monitored as \"patients under investigation,\" because they have symptoms like fever and cough and have been to Wuhan or in contact with patients.\n\nHundreds of other contacts of patients have been told to reach out to health officials immediately if they become ill.\n\nConcern about spread of the virus has increased as reports have emerged suggesting that people who are infected may be contagious even before symptoms develop.\n\nGerman physicians who identified the first coronavirus case in their country have reported that the patient was infected by a colleague visiting from China who was not yet sick herself.\n\nThat the disease may be transmitted before infected people show symptoms will make the disease harder to contain, experts say.\n\nA letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine said the German patient was a healthy 33-year-old businessman who developed a sore throat, chills and muscle aches on Jan. 24, with a fever spiking to 102.4 the next day, along with a cough. He felt better a day later and returned to work on Jan. 27.\n\nBefore he became ill, he had met with a Chinese business partner from his company near Munich, on Jan. 20 and 21. She was a resident of Shanghai who had been in Germany from Jan. 19-22. Though she was healthy during the visit, she got sick during her flight back to China, where she tested positive for the new coronavirus on Jan. 26. She informed her company, which traced her contacts to alert anyone she might have exposed.\n\nThe 33-year-old businessman was contacted, and though he was already feeling better, he tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn Jan. 28, three more employees of the company tested positive for the coronavirus, only one of whom had contact with the woman from Shanghai. The others were apparently infected by their male colleague, before he developed symptoms. All of them were admitted to the hospital, where they were isolated and monitored, and none has developed severe illness.\n\nThe authors of the letter in the New England Journal of Medicine, who are from Munich and Berlin, said it was \"notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient, in whom the illness was brief and non-specific.\"\n\n\"It does mean that transmission is more readily achieved than it was in SARS,\" an earlier coronavirus disease, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \"The report from Germany indicates quite conclusively that spread during the incubation period when the person is not sick themselves can take place.\"\n\nBut, he said, \"We don't know how frequently it happens.\"\n\n\"This is a kind of natural experiment, where people were nicely shown to be in a chain of transmission, and it sounds very, very plausible,\" Dr. Schaffner said.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

Wuhan, a City Short of Supplies and Overwhelmed", "body": "Wuhan Coronavirus\n\nWUHAN, China -- Weak with fever, An Jianhua waited in line for seven hours outside the hospital in the cold, hoping to get tested for the new coronavirus, which doctors suspected she had contracted.\n\nMs. An, 67, needed an official diagnosis from a hospital to qualify for treatment, but the one she and her son raced to last week had no space, even to test her. The next hospital they were referred to here in Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the center of the outbreak, was full, too, they said. They finally got an intravenous drip for Ms. An's fever, but that was all.\n\nSince then, Ms. An has quarantined herself at home. She and her son eat separately, wear masks at home and are constantly disinfecting their apartment. Ms. An's health is declining rapidly, and even keeping water down is a struggle.\n\n\"I can't let my mom die at home,\" said her son, He Jun. \"Every day I want to cry, but when I cry there are no tears. There is no hope.\"\n\nAs countries race to deal with an outbreak that has begun spreading around the world, inciting panic and disrupting the global economy, the residents of Wuhan are waging a daily battle to survive an illness that has sickened more than 4,100 people and killed 224 in their city alone.\n\nLast month, the government put Wuhan in a virtual lockdown, sealing off the city and banning most public transportation and private cars from its streets in a desperate effort to contain the outbreak. Now, many residents say it is nearly impossible to get the health care they need to treat -- or even diagnose -- the coronavirus.\n\nExpressing exasperation, doctors say there is a shortage of testing kits and other medical supplies, and it is not clear why more are not available. The ban on transportation means some residents have to walk for hours to get to hospitals -- if they are well enough to make the journey. Layers of bureaucracy stand between residents and help. And the long lines outside hospitals for testing and treatment suggest that the outbreak is spreading far beyond the official count of cases.\n\nAmbulances, too, are hard to come by, residents say. In recent days, some say they have called 120, China's equivalent of the emergency number 911, only to be told that there were already hundreds of people in the queue.\n\nThose who do make it to the hospital say they are squeezed together for hours in waiting rooms, where infections are easily spread. But the shortages have meant that many are ultimately turned away and sent home to self-quarantine, potentially compounding the outbreak by exposing their families.\n\nMany doctors and residents are putting their hopes on the two new coronavirus hospitals that China has been racing to build in Wuhan in just a matter of days. One of them spans about eight acres, has 1,000 beds and is scheduled to open on Monday. The government says 1,400 military medical workers will be deployed to work there, potentially helping with the shortage of health professionals on hand to combat the outbreak.\n\nOn Sunday, city officials announced plans to set up quarantine stations around Wuhan for people with symptoms of pneumonia and close contacts among coronavirus patients. But just over a week into the lockdown, many residents believe the virus has already spread much further than the official numbers suggest.\n\n\"The situation that we've seen is much worse than what has been officially reported,\" Long Jian, 32, said outside a hospital where his elderly father was being treated. Mr. Long said his father had to go to six hospitals and wait seven days before he could even be tested for the coronavirus.\n\nJust steps from where Mr. Long spoke, beds could be seen lining both sides of a narrow corridor in the emergency room. One man was getting an intravenous drip outside in his car.\n\n\"Those who can get diagnosed and treated are the lucky ones,\" Mr. Long said. \"In our neighborhood, many who weren't able to get diagnosed ended up dying at home.\"\n\nGetting treatment for the coronavirus in a hospital requires jumping through a number of hoops.\n\nAccording to official guidelines, patients are encouraged to go to their local hospitals first for initial assessments and sometimes prescriptions. Then patients are to deliver the results to their local neighborhood committees, which are responsible for communicating with the hospitals and coordinating resources for the households in their areas. There are about 1,000 neighborhood committees in Wuhan, for a population of 11 million.\n\nPatients with mild symptoms are typically told to go home and self-quarantine, according to a Jan. 24 notice by city officials. Those who have more severe symptoms are flagged by the neighborhood committees, which arrange for transportation by ambulance to one of the two dozen or so hospitals designated for treating the coronavirus.\n\nBut in practice, patients and their relatives say that the process takes far too long, and that the bar for what constitutes \"severe symptoms\" has been set too high -- so they give up and try waiting in long lines at hospitals instead.\n\nAmy Hu said her 64-year-old mother went to the doctor after experiencing a fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea about 10 days ago. Based on the initial assessment, the doctor told Ms. Hu's mother that she had contracted the coronavirus. But the test needed to confirm the diagnosis was not available, the doctor said.\n\nWithout the test, her mother couldn't be admitted to a hospital. Since then, Ms. Hu said, they have been waiting at home to hear back from the hospital about when her mother can be tested. In recent days Ms. Hu, who has been visiting her parents for the Lunar New Year holiday, took precautions herself: She checked into a hostel with her two children.\n\n\"I'm very dissatisfied with the government,\" Ms. Hu said. \"It's like only when the patients are close to death can they be admitted to a hospital.\"\n\nTong Yixuan, 31, said Sunday that he panicked last week when he learned that in just a few days, his father's cold had escalated into a full-blown illness that doctors said was almost certainly the coronavirus.\n\nBut neither his father, who had a 104-degree fever and was slipping in and out of consciousness, nor his mother, who was starting to show similar symptoms, could get tested. Hospitals said that there was no space, and that their symptoms were not severe enough, Mr. Tong said. His parents were sent home to quarantine themselves.\n\nThere was no way for Mr. Tong to help. He was more than 60 miles away in Huangshi, which days ago had been locked down by the government along with many other cities in Hubei Province. The roads out of Huangshi and into Wuhan had all been sealed off. For days, Mr. Tong was stuck. Only Saturday, after hours of negotiation with local officials, was he able to make it to his parents' bedside, he said. They have since been tested for the coronavirus, and his father has been admitted to a hospital. The process took 10 days.\n\n\"All I want to do is take care of my parents,\" Mr. Tong said. \"I don't even care if I get infected.\"\n\nFor some people, like Gan Hanjiang, the new hospitals cannot be built fast enough.\n\nLast month, his father came down with a severe fever and cough. He was tested for the coronavirus, but the results were negative. Ten days after the onset of symptoms, however, his father died, Mr. Gan said.\n\nThe hospital classified the cause as \"severe pneumonia,\" Mr. Gan said, but he believes it was the coronavirus.

Many other cases are suspected but not confirmed. As of Tuesday morning, at least 106 people have died, all in China.\n\nThe disease has been detected in at least 13 other countries, almost all involving people who traveled from China.\n\nFive cases have been confirmed in the United States: a woman in her 60s in Chicago, a man in his 30s in Washington state, two people in southern California, and one person in Arizona.\n\nThe outbreak began in a seafood and poultry market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China. But which animal is the source of the virus and how many people are at risk remain unclear. The virus can spread from person to person, but it is not known how easily.\n\nFollow the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Chinese authorities took the extraordinary step of closing off Wuhan, canceling planes and trains leaving the city and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it. By Friday, at least 12 other cities in Hubei Province had issued travel restrictions, including Huanggang, home to seven million people, and Ezhou, a city of about one million.\n\nThe restrictions on trains and other forms of public transportation come just before the Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people travel around and out of the country.\n\nThe restrictions also began spreading beyond Hubei. On Saturday, the Beijing city government announced that it would suspend all inter-province buses, effectively limiting road travel into the capital.\n\nResearchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London estimate that the number of cases may be five or ten times higher than what has been reported. Thousands of suspected cases are yet to be confirmed with tests, and others with the virus may not have sought medical attention.\n\nOn Monday, the Northeastern researchers estimated there may be around 25,000 cases. The estimates will change as more cases are reported and more information about the virus becomes known.\n\nThese estimates are based on an analysis of the population of Wuhan, the number of cases detected outside of China and the number of people who travel from Wuhan to other areas. Public health officials still do not know how the disease is transmitted, and experts urged caution in interpreting the estimates.\n\n\"These are very early models that make several assumptions based on what evidence is available,\" said David Heymann, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"They aren't truth -- they're just one step in trying to better understand this outbreak.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "k_k_rebecca_lai@nytimes.com", "name": "K.K.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/opinion/coronavirus-china-government.html", "title": "Opinion | Coronavirus Spreads, and the World Pays for China's Dictatorship", "body": "Xi used his tight rule to control information rather than to stop an epidemic.\n\nChina's leaders sometimes seem 10 feet tall, presiding over a political and economic juggernaut that has founded universities at a rate of one a week and that recently used more cement in three years than the United States did in the entire 20th century.\n\nPresident Trump has hailed China's president, Xi Jinping, as a \"brilliant leader,\" and Michael Bloomberg says Xi is \"not a dictator.\" But we're now seeing the dangers of Xi's authoritarian model, for China and the world.\n\nThe first known coronavirus infection in the city of Wuhan presented symptoms beginning on Dec. 1, and by late December there was alarm in Wuhan's medical circles. That would have been the moment for the authorities to act decisively.\n\nAnd act decisively they did -- not against the virus, but against whistle-blowers who were trying to call attention to the public health threat. A doctor who told a WeChat group about the virus was disciplined by the Communist Party and forced to admit wrongdoing. The police reported giving \"education\" and \"criticism\" to eight front-line doctors for \"rumormongering\" about the epidemic; instead of punishing these doctors, Xi should have listened to them.\n\nChina informed the World Health Organization of the virus on Dec. 31 but kept its own citizens in the dark; as other countries reported infections even as China pretended that it had confined the outbreak to Wuhan, Chinese joked grimly about a \"patriotic\" virus that only struck foreigners.\n\nWuhan's mayor said he wasn't authorized to discuss the virus until late this month. In that time, people traveled to and from Wuhan and didn't take precautions.\n\nThe government finally ordered a lockdown on Jan. 23 that effectively quarantined people in Wuhan. But by then, according to the mayor, five million people had already fled the city.\n\nPartly because the government covered up the epidemic in the early stages, hospitals were not able to gather supplies, and there are now major shortages of testing kits, masks and protective gear. Some doctors were reduced to making goggles out of plastic folders.\n\nOne reason for the early cover-up is that Xi's China has systematically gutted institutions like journalism, social media, nongovernmental organizations, the legal profession and others that might provide accountability. These institutions were never very robust in China, but on and off they were tolerated until Xi came along.\n\nI conducted a series of experiments on Chinese blogs over the years beginning in 2003 and was sometimes surprised by what I could get away with -- but no longer. Xi has dragged China backward in terms of civil society, crushing almost every wisp of freedom and oversight.\n\nFor the same reason that Xi's increasingly authoritarian China bungled the coronavirus outbreak, it also mishandled a swine flu virus that since 2018 has devastated China's hog industry and killed almost one-quarter of the world's pigs.\n\nDictators often make poor decisions because they don't get accurate information: When you squelch independent voices you end up getting just flattery and optimism from those around you. Senior Chinese officials have told me that they are routinely lied to on trips to meet local officials and must dispatch their drivers and secretaries to assess the truth and gauge the real mood.\n\nFor this or other reasons, Xi has made a series of mistakes. He mishandled and inflamed the political crisis in Hong Kong, he inadvertently assured the re-election of his nemesis as president of Taiwan, and he has presided over worsening relations with the United States and many other countries.\n\nThe coronavirus has already reached the Xinjiang region in the Far West of China, and one risk is that it will spread in the internment camps where China is confining about one million Muslims with poor sanitation and limited health care.\n\nViruses are challenges for any country, and it's only fair to note that China does a better job protecting its people from measles than the U.S. does. It's a credit to China's system that a baby born in Beijing today has a longer life expectancy than a baby born in Washington, D.C. More broadly, the United States, which has several impoverished counties with lower life expectancy than Cambodia or Bangladesh, is in no position to lecture anyone about health.\n\nBut, with a dose of humility, let's get over any misplaced admiration some Americans have for Xi's authoritarian model.\n\nThe Chinese social contract has been that citizens will not get ballots but will live steadily better lives, yet China's economy is now as weak as it has been in three decades -- and the coronavirus will sap growth further. Xi is not living up to his end of the bargain, and this is seen in the anger emerging on Chinese social media despite the best efforts of censors.\n\nI don't know if Xi is in political trouble for his misrule, but he should be. He's a preening dictator, and with this outbreak some citizens are paying a price.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

activity has been rising \"at a moderate rate,\" it added. \"Job gains have been solid.\"\n\nOfficials offered few hints at what could shake them from their wait-and-see approach, updating only a handful of words from their December statement.

Previously, it had stated that inflation was \"near\" that target.\n\nOfficials cut borrowing costs three times last year as trade tensions and slowing global growth weighed on the economic outlook. The move marked a full pivot from 2018, when the Fed was steadily raising rates to fend off higher inflation as unemployment sank steadily lower.\n\nBut Chair Jerome H. Powell has signaled that the central bank does not plan to cut interest rates as long as the growth outlook shapes up as expected, and does not intend to raise them unless inflation moves up and stay there. The federal funds rate is currently set in a 1.5 to 1.75 percent range. The decision to keep rates unchanged was unanimous.\n\nThe Fed is trying to stay nimble as growth chugs along but price increases remain subdued. But President Trump does not appear to welcome that approach.\n\nMr. Trump has been pushing the central bank to slash rates further and, in a tweet on Tuesday, said that \"the Fed should get smart & lower the Rate,\" arguing that comparatively high rates in the United States are putting the country at a disadvantage.\n\nThe central bank does not answer to the White House, and officials regularly reiterate that they set a policy with an eye toward their twin goals: maximum employment and stable inflation.\n\nYet officials are facing a conflicting backdrop when it comes to achieving those targets.\n\nHopes of a global growth turnaround had been climbing, helped along by an initial trade deal with China. Mr. Trump also signed a revised North American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday, bringing more than two years of fraught negotiations to a close.\n\nBut those positive signs could be dampened by the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is forcing quarantines in China and causing nervousness around the world.\n\nAnd while employers are still hiring and unemployment remains at a half-century low, inflation continues to fall short of the Fed's 2 percent target, which it has not hit sustainably since the central bank formally adopted the goal in 2012.\n\nTepid inflation leaves the central bank with less headroom to cut rates -- which include price increases -- in a downturn. And if consumers begin to expect slower increases, that outlook could become self-fulfilling, dragging price gains down further. Hardly anyone -- including Fed officials themselves -- expects it to eclipse 2 percent this year.\n\nMr. Powell is scheduled to speak at a 2:30 news conference, where he is expected to field questions about the Fed's patient stance and what it would take to prompt another policy change.\n\nThe central bank did nudge up the interest rates it pays on excess reserves -- essentially bank deposits that are stashed at the Fed. It is a technical adjustment meant to keep the Fed funds rate trading within its target range.\n\nIt also reaffirmed that it will continue purchasing Treasury bills \"at least into\" the second quarter of 2020. It has been purchasing short-term Treasury securities at a pace of $60 billion per month in a bid to keep the financial system flush with cash and to prevent money market ruptures, like one that reared its head in the repurchase market -- or repo market -- in September.\n\nFed officials, in a note released Wednesday, said the ultimate goal is to \"maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.\"\n\nThe Fed said that it will continue to conduct operations in the repo market, \"through April 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample\" even in stressful periods.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeanna_smialek@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeanna

need to know:A man from Wuhan has died in the Philippines.The death toll passed 300, with more than 14,000 infections confirmed.Hong Kong medical workers threaten to strike Monday.A man from Wuhan has died in the Philippines.\n\nA 44-year-old man in the Philippines has died of the coronavirus, health officials said on Sunday, making him the first known death outside China. The man, a resident of Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus, died on Saturday after developing what officials called \"severe pneumonia.\"\n\n\"This is the first known death of someone with 2019-nCoV outside of China,\" the World Health Organization's office in the Philippines said in a statement, using the technical shorthand for the coronavirus.\n\nPhilippines health officials said the man had arrived in the country on Jan. 21 with a 38-year-old woman who remains under observation.\n\n\"In his last few days, the patient was stable and showed signs of improvement; however, the condition of the patient deteriorated within his last 24 hours, resulting in his demise,\" the health secretary, Francisco Duque III, said.\n\nHours before the death was announced, the Philippines said it was temporarily banning non-Filipino travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nMr. Duque said the Philippines was currently observing 23 people who had been isolated in hospitals with possible coronavirus symptoms.\n\n\"The new developments warrant a more diligent approach in containing the threats of the 2019-nCoV,\" he said.\n\nThe death toll passed 300, with more than 14,000 infections confirmed.\n\nChinese officials on Sunday reported a surge in new cases.\n\n\u25c6 The death toll in China rose to at least 304.\n\n\u25c6 More than 2,000 new cases were also recorded in the country in the past 24 hours, raising the worldwide total to nearly 14,380, according to Chinese and World Health Organization data. The vast majority of the cases are inside China; about 100 cases have been confirmed in 23 other countries.\n\n\u25c6 All of China's provinces and territories have now been touched by the outbreak.\n\n\u25c6 Countries and territories that have confirmed cases: Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Macau, Russia, France, the United States, South Korea, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Britain, Vietnam, Italy, India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Finland, Sweden and Spain.\n\n\u25c6 Cases recorded in Thailand, Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam, Japan, France and the United States involved patients who had not been to China.\n\n\u25c6 China has asked the European Union for help in purchasing urgently needed medical supplies from its member countries, the China's official Xinhua news agency said on Saturday.\n\nHong Kong medical workers threaten to strike Monday.\n\nAs many as 9,000 medical workers in Hong Kong have pledged to strike this week, a threat that alarms the territory's officials as they are struggling to contain the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe workers are demanding that Hong Kong close all border checkpoints to visitors from mainland China, saying they represent a threat to health care workers in the city. They are planning to paralyze nonemergency and then emergency services at hospitals, a union formed during the city's anti-government protest movement said.\n\n\"We believe such actions are our last resort,\" the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance wrote in a statement Saturday night.\n\nUnder the plan, nonessential hospital staff members who belong to the union would not go to work on Monday. If the government failed to close the border and heed their other demands by 9 p.m., union members handling emergency services would also strike, the union said.\n\nMatthew Cheung, Hong Kong's No. 2 official, appealed to medical workers to reconsider, comparing them to guardians of the public.\n\n\"At this critical moment, I believe the general public would count on medical personnel to fight against the epidemic together, in the spirit of professionalism,\" he wrote in a blog post Sunday.\n\nHong Kong confirmed its 14th coronavirus case late Saturday. The patient, an 80-year-old man, had traveled for a few hours to mainland China in early January, and later spent several days in Japan.\n\nIn arguing against the job action, government officials say that the number of visitors from the mainland and other countries has decreased significantly after they closed several border points and rail stations and cut flight arrivals by half.\n\nBut several border points remain open, and many medical workers fear being overwhelmed by a flood of visitors seeking treatment in Hong Kong's well-regarded health care system. They have also voiced frustrations about patients from mainland China hiding their travel and medical history, potentially endangering other patients.\n\nAustin Ramzy, Jason Gutierrez and Tiffany May

Nearly 6,000 cases have been confirmed. How the coronavirus could be affecting the global economy.The United States is expanding its screenings.Scientists are racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nScientists are working to develop a vaccine capable of stopping the spread of a mysterious new coronavirus that has infected thousand of people, mostly in China.\n\nGovernment scientists in China, the United States and Australia, as well as those working at Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals are all working quickly to develop a vaccine.\n\nThe hunt began Jan. 10, when Chinese scientists posted the genetic makeup of the virus on a public database. The next morning, researchers at the National Institutes of Health's Vaccine Research Center in Maryland went to work. Within hours, they had pinpointed the parts of the genetic code that could be used to make a vaccine.\n\nHistorically, vaccines have been one of the greatest public health tools to prevent disease. But even as technology, genomics and global coordination have all improved, allowing researchers to move at top speed, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.\n\nThe outbreak is spreading. Nearly 6,000 cases have been confirmed.\n\nMore than 130 people have died from the mysterious new coronavirus, according to official Chinese statistics, but the real number is likely much higher. A dearth of test kits has hindered health officials ability to accurately diagnose and track the illness.\n\nHere's what we know about how the disease has spread:\n\n\u25c6 China said on Wednesday that 132 people had died from the virus, which is believed to have originated in the central city of Wuhan and is spreading across the country. The previous count, on Tuesday, was 106.\n\n\u25c6 The number of confirmed cases increased by nearly 25 percent to 5,974 on Wednesday, up from 4,515 on Tuesday, according to China's National Health Commission.\n\n\u25c6 Thailand has reported 14 cases of infection; Hong Kong has eight; the United States, Taiwan, Australia and Macau have five each; Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia each have reported four; Japan has seven; France has four; Canada has three; Vietnam has two; and Nepal, Cambodia and Germany each have one.\n\n\u25c6 Cases recorded in Taiwan, German, Vietnam and Japan involved patients who had not been to China. There have been no reported deaths outside China.\n\nHow the coronavirus could be affecting the global economy.\n\nAs the death toll from the mysterious coronavirus in China keeps rising, economic analysts have counseled caution. They say it's too soon to sound the alarm about the impact on the world economy.\n\nAnd yet, some American companies with a big presence in China are being forced to adapt. Starbucks, for example, announced on Tuesday that it was temporarily closing half of its stores there.\n\n\"The magnitude of the impact will depend on the duration of store closures as we work with local authorities to manage the situation and protect our partners and customers,\" Pat Grismer, its chief financial officer, said during an earnings call.\n\nStarbucks isn't alone. Also shuttering shops were McDonald's and Yum China, the country's largest restaurant company, which operates the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China and also controls its own brands.\n\nChina's travel restrictions and expanding screenings at airports around the world have also hurt business. United Airlines announced that it was suspending some flights. American Airlines stock fell more than 5 percent on Tuesday.\n\nHotels and resorts with properties in the affected areas, which include Macau, a special administrative region and gambling mecca, also saw the value of their shares sink. They include Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts International.\n\nMarriott, Hyatt and Hilton, which have several properties in China, also saw their stock prices slide.\n\nOther brands that are popular in China, like Estee Lauder, Nike and Tapestry, which sells Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, are likely to see a dent in earnings, bank analysts said.\n\nChina is the world's second largest economy.\n\nThe United States is expanding its screenings.\n\nUnited States health officials have announced expanded screening measures for passengers arriving from China at 20 ports of entry to the United States.\n\nExpanded screening had previously been at only five airports; now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that all 20 of its quarantine stations in airports and land stations across the mainland United States are participating, as well as those in Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.\n\n[A plane carrying Americans is leaving from Wuhan. If you know anyone on board, or anyone trying to leave Wuhan, we would like to hear from you for a coming article. Please contact Miriam Jordan at miriam.jordan@nytimes.com to share your story.]\n\nAmericans are now discouraged from traveling to any part of China, and other travel restrictions have not been ruled out, officials said. Only five people in the United States are known to have been infected so far.\n\nOfficials also announced on Tuesday that Chinese authorities will allow teams of international experts, coordinated by the World Health Organization, to help with research and containment.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the British Foreign Office is warning against all travel to Hubei Province and against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China. (The warning does not include Hong Kong and Macao).\n\nAnd the European Union -- at the request of France, which has many citizens in the Wuhan area -- announced that it was sending two flights to China to evacuate at least 350 healthy citizens of the bloc.\n\nReporting was contributed by Chris Buckley, Russell Goldman, Elaine Yu, Raymond Zhong, Alexandra Stevenson, Paul Mozur, Knvul Sheikh, Katie Thomas, James Gorman, Motoko Rich, Ben Dooley, Eimi Yamamitsu and Patricia Cohen.

"Coronavirus is starting to freak me out -- not the illness itself but the amped-up, ill-considered way our frightened world might respond to it.\n\nYes, the novel virus appears to be spreading quickly at the outbreak's epicenter in the Chinese province of Hubei, but after a late start the Chinese government is now imposing unprecedented measures to contain it. As the World Health Organization declared last week, it remains too early to call the outbreak a global public health emergency.\n\nSo far, the Wuhan coronavirus is not much more frightening than the outbreaks of other recent coronaviruses like SARS in 2003 or MERS in 2012, each of which killed fewer than a thousand people around the world. The new virus's death toll has just exceeded 130; for context, according to the CDC, about 15 million Americans have been sickened by the seasonal flu so far in the 2019-2020 flu season, and 8,200 have died from it. (The flu kills between 300,000 and 650,000 people around the world annually.)\n\nWhat worries me more than the new disease is that fear of a vague and terrifying new illness might spiral into panic and that it might be used to justify unnecessarily severe limits on movement and on civil liberties, especially of racial and religious minorities around the world.\n\nI also worry that the online world may give rise to dangerous skepticism and that in the event of an actual pandemic a large number of people may delay treatment or refuse vaccines because they don't believe the science or are suspicious of the government.\n\n\"I predict that the next major outbreak -- whether of a highly fatal strain of influenza or something else -- will not be due to a lack of preventive technologies,\" warned Heidi Larson, the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, in a 2018 article in the journal Nature. \"Instead, emotional contagion, digitally enabled, could erode trust in vaccines so much as to render them moot.\" Social media, she added, \"should be recognized as a global public-health threat.\"\n\nTech giants have been racing to tamp down conspiracy theories and hoaxes about the Wuhan virus, but I worry that their efforts won't be very successful, because society seems to have no good answer to the kind of emotional contagion Larson describes. It's not just that many people get their news from a medium given to rumor, exaggeration and wild misinformation, especially on issues about health or science -- see the persistence of anti-vaxers or climate-change deniers. There is also a growing partisan divide over how Americans interpret scientific expertise and health policy, leaving decisions about public health vulnerable to the kind of partisan squabbling you hear on cable news every night.\n\nI also worry about the hair-trigger state of geopolitics. From Donald Trump to Xi Jinping to Boris Johnson, strongmen with authoritarian tendencies run many of the world's most powerful governments. It is worth remembering that disease, or the fear of disease, can bring out the worst in humanity -- pandemics often feed scapegoating (Jews were widely blamed for the Black Death), creating a fertile field for demagogues. When you put all these factors together, you've got a dangerous recipe for global repression.\n\nAlready, China's response appears to be driven by political considerations more than epidemiological ones. The government has imposed a travel lockdown on more than 35 million people, which experts say is a quarantine of unprecedented size and scale, yet it may not even turn out to be very effective. Experts say that quarantines work best during the earliest stages of an outbreak but that they can also backfire, causing medical shortages, corroding trust in health officials and pushing some people to look to evade care to escape any restriction on their rights. China took weeks to mount a full-scale response to the virus. According to Wuhan's mayor, 5 million people left the city before restrictions were imposed, suggesting the country is effectively locking the barn door after the horse has run off.\n\n\"They're doing it because people who are in political leadership always think that if you do something dramatic and visible that you'll gain popular support,\" Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, told The Washington Post. \"They couldn't have any sound public health advice.\"\n\nWe should keep this sense of caution in mind in case American politicians begin pushing for travel bans, overbroad quarantines or other measures that might not be supported by the science.\n\nYou might wonder what the great harm is -- if the government needs to temporarily limit people's movements or prevent some people from entering the country, shouldn't it take those measures in the face of dangerous illness? Perhaps, but given the checkered history of quarantines -- throughout history, they have been used to persecute the marginalized -- lawmakers and the media should rigorously examine the bases for any such restrictions. We should especially make sure any restrictions imposed are indeed temporary and adhere to the science -- something we don't always do. Consider that 30 years after the AIDS outbreak, men who have sex with men are still restricted from donating blood in the United States, long after the scientific basis for such a ban has passed.\n\nSo far, President Donald Trump has offered a measured response to the virus. \"We have it totally under control,\" he said this week. But online, misinformation about the scale of the virus is already trending. (It is not, as you might have read on Twitter, \"thermonuclear pandemic level bad.\") So are racist memes blaming Chinese people and Chinese culture for the virus.\n\nI fear that the conditions are ripe for a situation similar to what occurred in the summer of 2014, when an outbreak of Ebola overran West Africa. After the Obama administration scrambled to bring home two American health workers who had become infected with the disease in Liberia, Trump went on a monthslong Twitter tirade about Ebola.\n\nThe future president favored extreme isolationism, seeing no benefit to American help in Africa. \"People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!\" he wrote -- ultimately sparking a growing partisan movement against the government's response to the virus.\n\nToday, Trump runs an administration that is hemorrhaging scientific expertise, and his political agenda is rife with efforts to target immigrants, minorities and the poor. In 2016, a terrorist attack prompted Trump to propose banning Muslims from the country; when he won the White House, he instituted a version of that ban.\n\nI fear that panic about a foreign virus offers society another chance to target marginalized people. So let's keep our fear in check; panic will hurt us far more than it'll help.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Hands Washington a Loss on Huawei", "body": "The White House couldn't persuade Boris Johnson to keep Huawei out of Britain's 5G network.\n\nEach week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.\n\nHi, this is David McCabe. I report on tech policy from The Times's bureau in Washington. But this past week, one of the biggest stories began with an announcement an ocean away.\n\nFor weeks, we had been waiting to see whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson would allow Huawei equipment to be used in Britain's 5G wireless network or follow American officials in shutting the company out. The United States has said for years that the company's networking gear could give the Chinese government access to key infrastructure.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Johnson revealed his decision: Huawei is in. The company's equipment can be used in a portion of the 5G, or fifth-generation, network.\n\nThis is a big setback for the Trump administration's global anti-Huawei push. The White House had sent top officials to London to try to sway Mr. Johnson, a close ally. Shortly after the British announcement, the European Union told its members to limit but not totally eliminate Huawei's role in their network.\n\nI messaged Adam Satariano, who covers tech in Europe from The Times's London bureau, to find out more about the fallout from Mr. Johnson's choice.\n\nWhy did Boris Johnson make the decision to allow Huawei to stay involved in building Britain's 5G network, despite all the pressure he was under from the Trump administration?\n\nThere are a few key reasons. First, a practical one. Huawei has been part of the British telecom network for years. 5G will be built on top of that existing system. To implement a ban now would be extraordinarily costly and delay the rollout of the faster network because a lot of that old kit would have to be ripped out.\n\nSecond, British intelligence and cybersecurity officials believe the risks of Huawei can be mitigated. As part of allowing Huawei to be part of its network, British officials years ago required the company to subject its products and code to tests. There's a lab near Cambridge where this is done. For British officials, this gives them a level of confidence that the problem can be managed. Of course, American officials think this is wishful thinking. With 5G, software plays a much bigger role, meaning it will be harder to keep harmful code from slipping through.\n\nFinally, as Britain exits the European Union, it can't afford to alienate China, which is a big investor in the country and a growing buyer of British exports. From an economic standpoint, it would be a big risk. Britain also sees 5G as a key to the country's economic future, and any delays could put it at a disadvantage to other countries.\n\nHere in Washington, Mr. Johnson's decision set off a paroxysm of concerned statements from the administration and hawkish members of Congress. What has the reaction been like in Britain?\n\nI think it was expected. The statement from the White House was actually quite mild. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo still went forward with a trip to Britain during the week. Perhaps harsher words were shared behind closed doors.\n\nThis Huawei decision is also just one example of a split between how tech is regulated in the United States and in Britain. What's the future of the special relationship when it comes to tech?\n\nComplicated. Like many countries in Europe, Britain is very frustrated with Big Tech. It doesn't think the companies pay their fair share in taxes. And with Facebook and Google/YouTube, not enough is done to limit the spread of harmful content. Attempts to address taxes and harmful content will gain momentum this year, potentially setting up more tension with the United States.\n\nIt's late in London, so I've got just one more: You cover all of Europe, not just Britain. Where does the American campaign to keep Huawei out of 5G networks go next?\n\nGermany is another country where the United States has been applying a lot of pressure. But as our colleagues Katrin Bennhold and Jack Ewing recently reported, it also faces a tough decision. China has threatened to retaliate if Huawei is banned. That is not an insignificant threat for Germany, which sells a lot of BMWs and VWs to China. Chancellor Angela Merkel has signaled she doesn't want a ban, but she is facing pressure from others in government who want to take a more aggressive approach.\n\nIt's a fascinating issue, touching on tech, trade, politics, foreign policy and national security.\n\nHow tech is shaping the coronavirus story\n\nThree stories during the week underscored how the news around the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China -- and the way the public has responded -- is being mediated by online platforms.\n\nThe Times's Raymond Zhong reported from Shanghai on the way that anger over the Chinese government's handling of the outbreak has boiled over on social media.\n\nNot surprisingly, the virus has also been the subject of online disinformation. BuzzFeed News's Jane Lytvynenko had a good roundup, including posts with false statements about how many people are affected and the authorities' response.\n\nBut in The Atlantic, Alexis Madrigal noted that it was important to remember that while \"out-and-out conspiracies and hoaxes will draw some attention, it's really the stuff that's close to the boundaries of discourse that grabs the most eyeballs.\"\n\nSome stories you shouldn't miss\n\nWorkers in Amazon or Walmart warehouses often sort through bins of random objects, looking for the right one to send off for packaging and delivery to consumers. Now, the robots are catching up, Adam Satariano and Cade Metz reported.\n\nEduardo Porter filed an article from Portland, Maine, where local officials and a wealthy donor are hoping to build out a greater tech presence.\n\nFacebook reported its lowest quarterly growth ever.\n\nLyft is restructuring and will lay off about 90 employees.\n\nApple's profit grew 11.4 percent to $22.3 billion, thanks to stronger iPhone, wearable and services revenue.\n\nHow are we doing?\n\nWe'd love your feedback on this newsletter.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html", "title": "As New Virus Spread, China's Old Habits Delayed Fight", "body": "Wuhan Coronavirus\n\nWUHAN, China -- A mysterious illness had stricken seven patients at a hospital, and a doctor tried to warn his medical school classmates. \"Quarantined in the emergency department,\" the doctor, Li Wenliang, wrote in an online chat group on Dec. 30, referring to patients.\n\n\"So frightening,\" one recipient replied, before asking about the epidemic that began in China in 2002 and ultimately killed nearly 800 people. \"Is SARS coming again?\"\n\nIn the middle of the night, officials from the health authority in the central city of Wuhan summoned Dr. Li, demanding to know why he had shared the information. Three days later, the police compelled him to sign a statement that his warning constituted \"illegal behavior.\"\n\nThe illness was not SARS, but something similar: a coronavirus that is now on a relentless march outward from Wuhan, throughout the country and across the globe, killing at least 259 people in China and infecting more than 11,700.\n\nThe government's initial handling of the epidemic allowed the virus to gain a tenacious hold. At critical moments, officials chose to put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis to avoid public alarm and political embarrassment.\n\nA reconstruction of the crucial seven weeks between the appearance of the first symptoms in early December and the government's decision to lock down the city, based on two dozen interviews with Wuhan residents, doctors and officials, on government statements and on Chinese media reports, points to decisions that delayed a concerted public health offensive.\n\nIn those weeks, the authorities silenced doctors and others for raising red flags. They played down the dangers to the public, leaving the city's 11 million residents unaware they should protect themselves. They closed a food market where the virus was believed to have started, but told the public it was for renovations.\n\nTheir reluctance to go public, in part, played to political motivations as local officials prepared for their annual congresses in January. Even as cases climbed, officials declared repeatedly that there had likely been no more infections.\n\nBy not moving aggressively to warn the public and medical professionals, public health experts say, the Chinese government lost one of its best chances to keep the disease from becoming an epidemic.\n\n\"This was an issue of inaction,\" said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies China. \"There was no action in Wuhan from the local health department to alert people to the threat.\"\n\nThe first case, the details of which are limited and the specific date unknown, was in early December. By the time the authorities galvanized into action on Jan. 20, the disease had grown into a formidable threat.\n\nIt is now a global health emergency. It has triggered travel restrictions around the world, shaken financial markets and created perhaps the greatest challenge yet for China's leader, Xi Jinping. The crisis could upend Mr. Xi's agenda for months or longer, even undermining his vision of a political system that offers security and growth in return for submission to iron-fisted authoritarianism.\n\nOn the last day of 2019, after Dr. Li's message was shared outside the group, the authorities focused on controlling the narrative. The police announced that they were investigating eight people for spreading rumors about the outbreak.\n\nThat same day, Wuhan's health commission, its hand forced by those \"rumors,\" announced that 27 people were suffering from pneumonia of an unknown cause. Its statement said there was no need to be alarmed.\n\n\"The disease is preventable and controllable,\" the statement said.\n\nDr. Li, an ophthalmologist, went back to work after being reprimanded. On Jan. 10, he treated a woman for glaucoma. He did not know she had already been infected with the coronavirus, probably by her daughter. They both became sick. So would he.\n\nHazmat Suits and Disinfectants\n\nHu Xiaohu, who sold processed pork in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, sensed by late December that something was amiss. Workers were coming down with nagging fevers. No one knew why but, Mr. Hu said, several were in hospital quarantine.\n\nThe market occupies much of a block in a newer part of the city, sitting incongruously near apartment buildings and shops catering to the growing middle class. It is a warren of stalls selling meats, poultry and fish, as well as more exotic fare, including live reptiles and wild game that some in China prize as delicacies. According to a report by the city's center for disease control, sanitation was dismal, with poor ventilation and garbage piled on wet floors.\n\nIn hospitals, doctors and nurses were puzzled to see a cluster of patients with symptoms of a viral pneumonia that did not respond to the usual treatments. They soon noticed that many patients had one thing in common: They worked in Huanan market.\n\nOn Jan. 1, police officers showed up at the market, along with public health officials, and shut it down. Xinhua news agency reported that the market was undergoing renovation, but that morning, workers in hazmat suits moved in, washing out stalls and spraying disinfectants.\n\nIt was, for the public, the first visible government response to contain the disease. The day before, on Dec. 31, national authorities had alerted the World Health Organization's office in Beijing of an outbreak.\n\nCity officials struck optimistic notes in their announcements. They suggested they had stopped the virus at its source. The cluster of illnesses was limited. There was no evidence the virus spread between humans.\n\n\"Projecting optimism and confidence, if you don't have the data, is a very dangerous strategy,\" said Alexandra Phelan, a faculty research instructor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Georgetown University.\n\n\"It undermines the legitimacy of the government in messaging,\" she added. \"And public health is dependent on public trust.\"\n\nNine days after the market closed, a man who shopped there regularly became the first fatality of the disease, according to a report by the Wuhan Health Commission, the agency that oversees public health and sanitation. The 61-year-old, identified by his last name, Zeng, already had chronic liver disease and a tumor in his abdomen, and had checked into Wuhan Puren Hospital with a raging fever and difficulty breathing.\n\nThe authorities disclosed the man's death two days after it happened. They did not mention a crucial detail in understanding the course of the epidemic. Mr. Zeng's wife had developed symptoms five days after he did.\n\nShe had never visited the market.\n\nThe Race to Identify a Killer\n\nAbout 20 miles from the market, scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were studying samples from the patients checking into the city's hospitals. One of the scientists, Zheng-Li Shi, was part of the team that tracked down the origins of the SARS virus, which emerged in the southern province of Guangdong in 2002.\n\nAs the public remained largely in the dark about the virus, she and her colleagues quickly pieced together that the new outbreak was related to SARS. The genetic composition suggested a common initial host: bats. The SARS epidemic began when a coronavirus jumped from bats to Asian palm civets, a catlike creature that is legally raised and consumed. It was likely that this new coronavirus had followed a similar path -- possibly somewhere in or on the way to the Huanan market or another market like it.\n\nAround the same time, Dr. Li and other medical professionals in Wuhan started trying to provide warnings to colleagues and others when the government did not. Lu Xiaohong, the head of gastroenterology at City Hospital No. 5, told China Youth Daily that she had heard by Dec. 25 that the disease was spreading among medical workers -- a full three weeks before the authorities would acknowledge the fact. She did not go public with her concerns, but privately warned a school near another market.\n\nBy the first week of January, the emergency ward in Hospital No. 5 was filling; the cases included members of the same family, making it clear that the disease was spreading through human contact, which the government had said was not likely.\n\nNo one realized, the doctor said, that it was as serious as it would become until it was too late to stop it.\n\n\"I realized that we had underestimated the enemy,\" she said.\n\nAt the Institute of Virology, Dr. Shi and her colleagues isolated the genetic sequence and the viral strain during the first week of January. They used samples from seven of the first patients, six of them vendors at the market.\n\nOn Jan. 7, the institute's scientists gave the new coronavirus its identity and began referring to it by the technical shorthand nCoV-2019. Four days later, the team posted the genetic sequence of the new virus on a database of sequences of nucleotides, the molecules that are basic units of DNA.\n\nThat allowed scientists around the world to study the virus and swiftly share their findings. As the scientific community moved quickly to devise a test for exposure, political leaders remained reluctant to act.\n\n'Politics is Always No. 1'\n\nAs the virus spread in early January, the mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, was touting futuristic health care plans for the city.\n\nIt was China's political season, when officials gather for annual meetings of People's Congresses -- the Communist Party-run legislatures that discuss and praise policies. It is not a time for bad news.\n\nWhen Mr. Zhou delivered his annual report to the city's People's Congress on Jan. 7 against a backdrop of bright red national flags, he promised the city top-class medical schools, a World Health Expo, and a futuristic industry park for medical companies. Not once did he or any other city or provincial leader publicly mention the viral outbreak.\n\n\"Stressing politics is always No. 1,\" the governor of Hubei, Wang Xiaodong, told officials on Jan. 17, citing Mr. Xi's precepts of top-down obedience. \"Political issues are at any time the most fundamental major issues.\"\n\nShortly after, Wuhan went ahead with a massive annual potluck banquet for 40,000 families from a city precinct, which critics later cited as evidence that local leaders took the virus far too lightly.\n\nAs the congress was taking place, the health commission's daily updates on the outbreak said again and again that there were no new cases of infection, no firm evidence of human transmission and no infection of medical workers.\n\n\"We knew this was not the case!\" said a complaint later filed with the National Health Commission on a government website. The anonymous author said he was a doctor in Wuhan and described a surge in unusual chest illnesses beginning Jan. 12.\n\nOfficials told doctors at a top city hospital \"don't use the words viral pneumonia on the image reports,\" according to the complaint, which has since been removed. People were complacent, \"thinking that if the official reports had nothing, then we were exaggerating,\" the doctor explained.\n\nEven those stricken felt lulled into complacency.\n\nWhen Dong Guanghe developed a fever on Jan. 8 in Wuhan, his family was not alarmed, his daughter said. He was treated in the hospital and sent home. Then, 10 days later, Mr. Dong's wife fell ill with similar symptoms.\n\n\"The news said nothing about the severity of the epidemic,\" said the daughter, Dong Mingjing. \"I thought that my dad had a common cold.\"\n\nThe government's efforts to minimize public disclosure persuaded more than just untrained citizens.\n\n\"If there are no new cases in the next few days, the outbreak is over,\" Guan Yi, a respected professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong, said on Jan. 15.\n\nThe World Health Organization's statements during this period echoed the reassuring words of Chinese officials.\n\nIt had spread. Thailand reported the first confirmed case outside China on Jan. 13.\n\nA City Besieged\n\nThe first deaths and the spread of the disease abroad appeared to grab the attention of the top authorities in Beijing. The national government dispatched Zhong Nanshan, a renowned and now-semiretired epidemiologist who was instrumental in the fight against SARS, to Wuhan to assess the situation.\n\nHe arrived on Jan. 18, just as the tone of local officials was shifting markedly. A health conference in Hubei Province that day called on medical workers to make the disease a priority. An internal document from Wuhan Union Hospital warned its employees that the coronavirus could be spread through saliva.\n\nOn Jan. 20, more than a month after the first symptoms spread, the current of anxiety that had been steadily gaining strength exploded into public. Dr. Zhong announced in an interview on state television that there was no doubt that the coronavirus spread with human contact. Worse, one patient had infected at least 14 medical personnel.\n\nMr. Xi, fresh from a state visit to Myanmar, made his first public statement about the outbreak, issuing a brief set of instructions.\n\nIt was only with the order from Mr. Xi that the bureaucracy leapt into action. At that point the death toll was three; in the next 11 days, it would rise above 200.\n\nIn Wuhan, the city banned tour groups from visiting. Residents began pulling on masks.\n\nGuan Yi, the Hong Kong expert who had earlier voiced optimism that the outbreak could level off, was now alarmed. He dropped by one of the city's other food markets and was shocked by the complacency, he said. He told city officials that the epidemic was \"already beyond control\" and would leave. \"I hurriedly booked a departure,\" Dr. Guan told Caixin, a Chinese news organization.\n\nTwo days later, the city announced that it was shutting itself down, a move that could only have been approved by Beijing.\n\nIn Wuhan, many residents said they did not grasp the gravity of the epidemic until the lockdown. The mass alarm that officials feared at the start became a reality, heightened by the previous paucity of information.\n\nCrowds of people crushed the airport and train stations to get out before the deadline fell on the morning of Jan. 23. Hospitals were packed with people desperate to know if they, too, were infected.\n\n\"We didn't wear masks at work. That would have frightened off customers,\" Yu Haiyan, a waitress from rural Hubei, said of the days before the shutdown. \"When they closed off Wuhan, only then did I think, 'Oh, this is really serious, this is not some average virus.'\"\n\nWuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, later took responsibility for the delay in reporting the scale of the epidemic, but said he was hampered by the national law on infectious diseases. That law allows provincial governments to declare an epidemic only after receiving central government approval. \"After I receive information, I can only release it when I'm authorized,\" he said.\n\nThe official reflex for suppressing discomforting information now appears to be cracking, as officials at various levels seek to shift blame for the government's response.\n\nWith the crisis worsening, Dr. Li's efforts are no longer viewed as reckless. A commentary on the social media account of the Supreme People's Court criticized the police for investigating people for circulating rumors.\n\n\"It might have been a better way to prevent and control the new coronavirus today if the public had believed the 'rumor' then and started to wear masks and carry out sanitary measures and avoid the wild animal market,\" the commentary said.\n\nDr. Li is 34 and has a child. He and his wife are expecting a second in the summer. He is now recovering from the virus in the hospital where he worked. In an interview via text messages, he said he felt aggrieved by the police actions.\n\n\"If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier,\" he said, \"I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency.\"\n\nThis article is based on reporting and research by Elsie Chen, Sheri Fink, Claire Fu, Javier Hernandez, Zoe Mou, Amy Qin, Knvul Sheikh, Amber Wang,

a lockdown, anger and anxiety deepened in the central Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday as a shortage of hospital beds, medical supplies and doctors boiled over into physical confrontations and desperate pleas for help.\n\nIn a sign of growing frustration, a relative of a patient infected with the virus beat up a doctor at a hospital in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, the state broadcaster CCTV reported on Thursday, citing the police. The man was accused of pulling and damaging the doctor's mask and protective clothing -- potentially exposing him to the virus -- after his father-in-law died in the hospital. The man was later detained.\n\nAt the same time, hospitals in the region renewed pleas to the public for help to replenish their supplies, which were fast disappearing. The shortages have become especially severe in Huanggang, a city of seven million not far from Wuhan, where some medical staff members were wearing raincoats and garbage bags as shoe covers to protect against infection, according to Yicai, a financial news site.\n\nOn Thursday, Chinese government agencies announced plans to issue subsidies of up to $43 per day to front-line medical workers and to reopen factories to boost production of medical supplies and protective gear.\n\n\"We absolutely cannot let Huanggang become a second Wuhan,\" Wang Xiaodong, the governor of Hubei Province, said at a news briefing on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday evening, provincial leaders said at a news briefing that the director of Huanggang's health committee had been fired.\n\nFor many Chinese, such decisive government announcements are too little, too late. Concerns have grown as the death toll from the coronavirus has quickly ticked upward, rising by 38 to hit 170 on Thursday. All but one of those recent deaths have occurred in Hubei Province; the other died in the southwestern province of Sichuan.\n\nFueling the anger on Thursday was the publication this week of a new paper about the coronavirus in The New England Journal of Medicine by a team of researchers affiliated with, among other places, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDrawing on data from the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, the paper states that \"there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.\"\n\nChinese people online were incensed, asking why the government had waited until Jan. 20 to inform the public that the virus was capable of being transmitted from human to human. By Thursday evening, many had seized on the paper as evidence that the authors had purposely withheld valuable information out of academic self-interest.\n\n\"I'm about to explode, I need an explanation from the authors!!!!\" Wang Liming, a professor at Zhejiang University, wrote in a widely shared social media post that was quickly deleted. \"As a researcher with firsthand information, you knew that the virus could be transmitted between humans three weeks before the public did. Did you do what you were supposed to do?\"\n\nAs China raced to contain the outbreak, countries grappled with how to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan and how to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nAfter Australia announced a plan to evacuate its citizens in Wuhan to Christmas Island, which has played an important but checkered role in the country's contentious use of faraway sites to house refugees and other migrants, some questioned the implications of using the island as a quarantine site.\n\nMoving people to Christmas Island is not an \"appropriate solution,\" Dr. Tony Bartone, the president of the Australian Medical Association, said in a television news interview. He said the government had other, more suitable facilities, such as military sites.\n\nIn Japan, a furor erupted over the refusal of some evacuees who had returned to submit to medical testing.\n\nTwo of the Japanese citizens who have been evacuated from Wuhan refused to be tested for the coronavirus, leading the prime minister to explain that citizens could not be forced to submit to a medical examination.\n\nJapanese social media users said the travelers, who arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday, were putting the country at risk. Some called them terrorists.\n\n\"We tried to persuade the two returnees from Wuhan for many hours\" to be tested, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in Parliament on Thursday, when asked about the government's treatment of repatriated citizens. \"But there is no legally binding force, and that's a great regret.\" Mr. Abe said.\n\nRussia ordered 16 of its approximately 25 crossing points on its 2,600-mile border Chinese border to be closed as of midnight local time as fears about the coronavirus outbreak mounted in Moscow.\n\n\"We have to do everything to protect our people,\" Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Thursday in televised remarks at a cabinet meeting.\n\nItaly has blocked thousands of people from leaving a cruise ship that docked on Thursday at an Italian port, over concerns that someone aboard might have the virus.\n\nAccording to Italy's national news agency ANSA, a woman from Hong Kong aboard the Costa Smeralda, a vessel owned by Costa Cruises, had a fever and was experiencing respiratory problems. Both the woman and a man traveling with her, who did not present any symptoms, were being held in isolation in a hospital ward aboard the ship and were tested by infectious disease experts from a hospital in Rome.\n\nIn the United States, health officials on Thursday reported the first case of person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus in the United States. The patient is the husband of a woman who returned from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus, and was the first reported case in Chicago, officials said at a news briefing.\n\nThe United States commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said there could be a silver lining in China's woes because the coronavirus outbreak could prompt employers to move jobs to the United States.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,\" Mr. Ross said in an interview on Fox Business. \"I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America. Some to the U.S., probably some to Mexico as well.\"\n\nHis remarks may be seen as insensitive to a country in crisis, and he has faced such criticism in the past. During the government shutdown in early 2019, Mr. Ross suggested that furloughed workers should take out loans while they went without pay for more than a month.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 7,700 people in China and 18 other countries.\n\nWith the evacuations and lockdown, Wuhan, a typically bustling metropolis, has been transformed into a ghost town. Since the city was effectively sealed off last week, most shops have shut down. The city government has put restrictions on traffic. The lack of transportation options has made it difficult for medical workers and sick residents to get to hospitals.\n\nBut most residents of Wuhan are not leaving their homes because they are too scared of catching the virus.\n\n\"Local Wuhan residents who aren't worried about being sick aren't even going on the streets,\" Chen Qiushi, a Beijing-based lawyer and citizen journalist who has been in Wuhan since the lockdown began, said in a video blog posted on Thursday. \"The locals are all very scared,\" he added. \"I'm starting to get scared.\"\n\nWhen Wuhan residents step outside, it's mostly to go to the supermarkets, food stores and pharmacies that stay open as part of a government effort to sustain the city. Senior officials have promised that residents need not worry about vegetables, fruit or other staples.\n\nWhile Wuhan residents have been able to buy food, some complained about price increases or expressed fear that a prolonged shutdown might choke off food supplies. And if the shutdown lasts weeks longer, with the rest of China also scrambling to secure food supplies, it could make things more serious, several residents said.\n\n\"If we can't bring in produce, it will become more expensive, or we might even have to close up,\" said Zuo Qichao, who was selling piles of cucumbers, turnips and tomatoes. As he spoke, a woman accused him of unfairly raising the turnips' price.\n\n\"Every county, every village around here is now putting up barriers, worried about that disease,\" Mr. Zuo said. \"Even if the government says it wants food guaranteed, it won't be easy -- all those road checks.\"\n\nAmy Qin reported from Beijing, and Christopher Buckley from Wuhan, China.

epidemic, the country is relying on a medical system that is overburdened even in normal times.\n\nAfter suffering from a fever and breathing problems for more than 15 days, Xiao Shibing, a 51-year-old resident of Wuhan, China, finally sought help at a hospital. Despite the symptoms, he was not tested for the new coronavirus -- a lapse suggesting that there may be far more cases of the virus than are being officially reported.\n\nInstead, Mr. Xiao was told that he had a viral chest infection, so he went back home. As he grew sicker, he went to three other hospitals. But they told him they did not have enough beds.\n\nLike many of the thousands of Chinese patients dealing with this new coronavirus, Mr. Xiao is scrambling to get help from a health care system straining to serve even the basic needs of patients.\n\n\"It is like kicking a ball from here to there,\" said his wife, Feng Xiu.\n\nWuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 2,700 people in China and a handful in other countries.\n\nMr. Xiao, who was eventually hospitalized on Sunday -- about a week after his initial attempt -- still hasn't been tested for the pneumonialike virus.\n\nAs it struggles to combat a coronavirus epidemic that has sickened more than 2,700 people and killed 80, the Chinese government is relying on a medical system that is overburdened and overwhelmed even in normal times. While other parts of everyday life in China have significantly improved in the past decade, the quality of health care has stagnated.\n\nIn major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, many people have to stand in line in the wee hours of the morning to secure appointments with doctors. When they do get an appointment, patients get only a couple of minutes with a doctor. During flu season, residents set up camp overnight with blankets in hospital corridors.\n\nChina does not have a functioning primary care system, so most people flock to hospitals. On an ordinary day, doctors are frustrated and exhausted as they see as many as 200 patients.\n\nThose weaknesses are most pronounced in the poorer areas of China -- such as Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus. Panicked residents of the city are heading to the hospitals if they have any sign of a cold or cough. Videos circulating on Chinese social media show doctors straining to handle the enormous workload and hospital corridors loaded with patients, some of whom appear to be dead.\n\nDespite having dealt with the SARS coronavirus nearly two decades ago, many Chinese hospitals in smaller cities are not fully prepared to deal with a major outbreak like the current virus. Wuhan hospitals have posted messages online urgently appealing for medical equipment. The situation is even more desperate in poorer, rural areas nearby.\n\nLast week, eight hospitals in Hubei Province -- where Wuhan is situated and where most of the cases have appeared -- put out a call for N95 masks, goggles, surgical masks and surgical gowns. In the absence of proper equipment, some medical workers have resorted to cutting plastic folders to jury-rig goggles.\n\nYanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said China had invested a lot in building a robust public health infrastructure in the wake of SARS and that many of them were mostly well equipped to deal with infectious diseases.\n\n\"But they apparently didn't anticipate something so sudden, so acute, and so tremendous,\" he said.\n\nThe government's response to the crisis could exacerbate the problems. Across China, the authorities are sealing off cities, closing down schools and checking on residents. But the lockdown -- affecting 56 million people -- could make it difficult to get medical supplies to hospitals that desperately need them.\n\nChinese officials have acknowledged that they are struggling to deal with the outbreak. At a news conference last week, the Wuhan health commission said there were long lines and a shortage of beds. In response, it said it had designated hospitals as \"fever clinics\" for people to go to for treatment.\n\nWith medical facilities in short supply, the local government has also pledged to build a new 1,000-bed hospital in 10 days, and vowed that another new 1,300-bed hospital would be ready by the middle of next month. It is taking a page out of the government's playbook during SARS, when it built a new hospital in Beijing in just a week.\n\nYet it is still not clear that there will be sufficient beds to deal with the virus, which remains highly contagious.\n\nChen Xi, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Yale School of Public Health, said it was more important to have a working system of family doctors who can act as gatekeepers for the hospitals.\n\n\"Without an efficient screening process,\" he said, \"these two hospitals would not be very effective.\"\n\nThe central government is under increasing pressure to show that it is adequately coping with the crisis. On Monday, Premier Li Keqiang, who has been assigned to oversee the national response to the outbreak, visited Wuhan to inspect efforts to contain the disease. He pledged to provide local health centers with 20,000 pairs of safety goggles.\n\nAs the government scrambles to contain the outbreak, the sick are just trying to get medical attention.\n\nCai Pei, 41, said his wife had begun coughing and developed a fever three days ago. He wrote on Weibo, a popular social media platform, that hospitals would not admit her, and that he had difficulty finding masks and cold medicine in pharmacies.\n\nMaking matters worse, three Chinese medical companies have said that they do not have the capacity to make enough test kits for the new coronavirus, according to local news media reports.\n\nMr. Cai and his wife still do not know whether she is infected with the coronavirus or another more common ailment.\n\n\"Sometimes I can only hide and cry, but I couldn't tell her and had to reassure her that it is not the virus,\" Mr. Cai said by telephone. \"It is very scary. If it's real, we have a child and elderly parents at home. What if we all get sick?\"\n\nWith no proven drugs to treat the new virus, the health authorities have told doctors to prescribe a combination of treatments -- anti-viral H.I.V. drugs as well as traditional Chinese medicine -- to patients. Some of the medicines being prescribed are a mixture of ingredients like buffalo horn, jasmine and honeysuckle as well as anti-viral H.I.V. drugs like Lopinavir and Ritonavir.\n\nAs happened with SARS, traditional Chinese medicine -- an industry that the government has pledged to develop -- is prominently being touted as a way to treat this new coronavirus. But there is no clinical evidence that the gallstones of cattle, the roots of plants and licorice could work in combating it.\n\nJournals have published studies by Chinese scientists saying that traditional Chinese medicine helped alleviate symptoms of SARS. China's ministry of science and technology said in 2003 that it had found banlangen, the root of the woad plant, as well as a liquid made up of ingredients like cholic acid, jasmine, buffalo horn and honeysuckle to be effective in curing an acute inflammation of the lungs.\n\n\"There has never been a good antiviral agent, so that means that people would try things that have some effect,\" said Dominic Dwyer, a medical virologist at the University of Sydney. \"But there's no evidence of significant benefits with any antiviral drugs or traditional Chinese medicine.\"\n\nThe problem with finding a drug that can effectively fight an infectious disease such as this coronavirus, SARS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is that it needs to be tested in sufficient numbers in a randomized way in proper clinical trials. Patients must also give informed consent.\n\n\"That is very difficult in an outbreak situation,\" said Kanta Subbarao, a senior researcher on respiratory illnesses at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nIn Wuhan, Mr. Xiao's daughter, Xiao Hongxia, said her father had been diagnosed with severe pneumonia and was now labeled a \"highly suspicious case.\" He is relying on ordinary fever medicines and anti-inflammatory drugs, she said.\n\n\"There is no special medicine for the coronavirus so far,\" Ms. Xiao said, \"so we can only rely on the patient's own immunity.\"\n\nAmber Wang, Yiwei Wang and Elsie Chen contributed research.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"Your Monday Briefing", "body": "Good morning.\n\nWe're covering the continuing spread of the new coronavirus, the countdown to the Iowa caucus, and accusations of sexual harassment at Victoria's Secret.\n\nMore countries wall off China to contain coronavirus\n\nThe death toll from the new coronavirus has risen to more than 300 people, with more than 14,000 known infections worldwide. In the Philippines, a man who had recently arrived from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, became the first recorded fatality outside of China. Some of the world's leading experts now believe a pandemic -- an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents -- is nearly inevitable.\n\nMany airlines have suspended service to China, and the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore have joined the U.S. in temporarily barring most travelers from China. China's vast economy and the global supply chains it feeds are fraying.\n\nBut some top officials in Southeast Asia, which has the largest cluster of coronavirus patients outside China, have dismissed the threat and even pushed remedies not supported by science.\n\nHere's the latest, and a map of infections.\n\nHow we got here: Public health experts say China initially put secrecy and order ahead of confronting the coronavirus. Reconstructing the first seven weeks of its spread, our reporters showed how the authorities silenced doctors and others for raising red flags and soft-pedaled the danger.\n\nIn Wuhan: A new hospital for those with the coronavirus, built in just 10 days, opens today. But most hospitals are swamped and the population of 11 million is struggling under quarantine. With many of the sick going untested and untreated because of circuitous bureaucracy and short supplies, the number of infected and dead could be significantly higher than reported.\n\nTrump to give State of the Union address with acquittal near\n\nThe impeachment trial of President Trump is in its final days.\n\nAfter the Senate voted on Friday to block new witnesses and evidence, a final vote on whether to convict the president is scheduled for Wednesday, a day after the State of the Union address.\n\nA few Republicans have conceded that they believe Democrats proved their case that Mr. Trump tried to leverage security aid to Ukraine for political gain, but argue that doing so does not warrant removal from office. Acquittal is a near certainty.\n\nThe big picture: Mr. Trump, freed of worries about congressional constraint, will take his victory and \"his case of grievance, persecution and resentment to the campaign trail,\" our chief White House correspondent writes in an analysis. He will be the first president in U.S. history to face voters after an impeachment trial.\n\nDemocrats make last pitches in bellwether Iowa\n\nToday brings the first contest in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination: the Iowa caucus, whose highly unpredictable outcome could reshape the field. It's a complicated system. Here's how it works.\n\nIowa has huge influence in picking presidential candidates, but the prairie state doesn't look much like the country as a whole -- except in its rapidly aging population.\n\nOn the ground: What began as a debate over policy and ideology has given way to a fixation on electability. Candidates have adjusted their final appeals to make the case that they represent the party's best chance of beating Mr. Trump in November.\n\nBy the numbers: The latest polls show Bernie Sanders overtaking Joe Biden in Iowa, and closing in on his national lead. And here's how much cash each 2020 Democratic candidate has on hand.\n\nBrexit is over. And it's only just begun.\n\nIt's the start of a new era for Britain.\n\nThe country formally withdrew from the European Union on Friday after nearly half a century of membership, drawing a mixed reaction of celebration, despair and relief. The shape of its society and economy and its place in the world are all up for grabs.\n\nLooking ahead: The positive case for Brexit -- one where Britain strides into a future of economic renewal and cleareyed politics -- will now be tested. The question is: What if it works?\n\nIn the E.U.: Many of the British officials who worked in Brussels are now out of a job, and some are racing to claim E.U. passports.\n\nIf you have 15 minutes, this is worth itMisogyny at Victoria's Secret\n\nTrue to its name, the world's lingerie powerhouse has kept a secret: that of a degrading work environment where, our reporters found, women were objectified and complaints of sexual harassment were buried.\n\nVictoria's Secret now says it is reforming itself, but its future is unclear in the #MeToo era.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nSuper Bowl: The Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers are squaring off in Miami. Here's our live coverage.\n\nAustralian Open: Novak Djokovic prevailed in five sets against Dominic Thiem on Sunday to claim his 17th Grand Slam singles title and the No. 1 ranking.\n\nBritain: A man in South London was shot dead by the police after three people were stabbed in what the authorities described as a \"terrorist-related\" incident.\n\nIn memoriam: Leila Janah, an activist and entrepreneur who employed thousands of desperately poor people in Africa and India in an effort to extend opportunity to the marginalized, died at 37 of a rare soft-tissue cancer.\n\nSnapshot: Above, a yacht party in Tucacas, Venezuela, northwest of the capital. While much of the country is deteriorating, wealthy enclaves in Caracas are enjoying Prada and artisanal beer for the few.\n\nCanada: Victoria, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, has long marketed itself as Canada's most English city. But its mayor has lately been trying to shake off the heritage of the British Empire -- much like its newest and most famous residents, Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan.\n\nWhat we're listening to: The \"Best Known Method\" podcast. Our health reporter Anahad O'Connor welcomed its return for a second season. \"Greatly enjoyed this discussion with Professor Emily Oster,\" he tweeted, \"especially now that I'm a dad and can benefit from her parenting insights.\"\n\nNow, a break from the news\n\nCook: Looking for a quick Monday dinner with minimal prep? Try lemony shrimp and bean stew.\n\nRead: A collection by the poet Robert Hass is among 10 new books we recommend.\n\nGo: A show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York traces the history and cultural heritage of kingdoms on the Sahara's rim.\n\nSmarter Living: Our Social Q's column offers advice to a woman who finds her husband's nieces and nephews \"unruly, unintelligent and uninteresting.\"\n\nAnd now for the Back Story on ...Britain's big moment\n\nThe yearslong exit from the European Union happened at midnight Friday in Brussels, 11 p.m. in Britain itself. (Because of course they're in different time zones.)\n\nOur London correspondent Ben Mueller was on duty. \"It felt a little anticlimactic,\" he said. \"There had been such fireworks, and then the legislation passed without contention.\"\n\nAlcohol was banned in Parliament Square for the big celebration, but vendors brought in beer. \"They couldn't do without it,\" Ben said.\n\nThe immediate difference? \"Britain no longer has representation or say in the machinery of the European Union.\"\n\nMany other aspects of the departure remain, to be resolved (or not) during a transition period that will end when 2020 does. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already signaled a tough stand for trade talks that will begin in March.\n\nBen noted that even hopes to have the moment marked by a bong from Big Ben (no relation) were dashed. Westminster's famed four-faced clock is under renovation, and speeding the process up to allow the bell to sound would have cost 500,000 pounds. Efforts to raise the money fell short and parliamentary authorities nixed the plan.\n\nSo a recording of Big Ben was played outside, and inside 10 Downing Street, Mr. Johnson banged a gong.\n\nThat's it for this briefing. See you next time.\n\n-- Penn\n\nThank you\n\nTo Mark Josephson and Eleanor Stanford for the break from the news. Andrea Kannapell, the Briefings editor, wrote today's Back Story.

Coronavirus: Countries Limit Travel to China", "body": "HONG KONG -- Countries, cities and businesses across the globe issued new travel warnings on Tuesday, vastly expanding a cordon intended to control the flow of people to and from China, where the authorities are struggling to contain the outbreak of the new coronavirus.\n\nIn the most drastic measure to limit travel, the Hong Kong authorities reduced by half the number of flights and shut down rail service to mainland China, and they also limited visas -- moves that could inspire other governments to follow suit.\n\nMeasures to contain the outbreak of the virus to its epicenter in Hubei Province appear to have failed to stop the contagion.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Chinese officials said the number of cases had increased 60 percent overnight. Experts warned that the actual number of cases could be significantly higher and growing quickly. The number of deaths attributed to the virus also continued to grow.\n\nThe new travel restrictions put a deeper freeze on China's contact with the world, cutting off business and tourism as China's economy faces a potential slowdown.\n\nWith China's Lunar New Year holiday nearing its end, companies ordered workers to stay home and avoid travel. The economic impact of such measures pointed to a deeper political crisis, with many people accusing the Chinese authorities online of failing to act quickly to contain the virus, even as the government continues to struggle to control its spread.\n\nThe travel advisories and bans came as the virus showed early signs of spreading outside China, with cases of transmission to people who had not recently traveled to China reported in Japan, Germany and Vietnam. Countries across the world may now be faced with the task of limiting the spread of the disease on their own soil, not simply seeking to identify and quarantine infected people who had been in China.\n\nOfficials at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against nonessential travel to China, noting that there is \"limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.\" The United States is expanding the screening of travelers arriving from Wuhan to 20 airports and other ports of entry, from five, federal officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe World Health Organization revised its global risk assessment for the outbreak from \"moderate\" to \"high,\" although it noted this shift in a footnote buried in a report published on Monday. The change in the risk assessment, which coincided with a visit to China by the organization's director general, risked confusing the public about the severity of the outbreak, which has killed more than 100 people in China and been diagnosed in at least 14 countries.\n\nThe World Health Organization was criticized after it refused twice in recent days to declare the outbreak a global emergency, despite its spread.\n\nWith other countries scrambling to evacuate their citizens from the locked-down epicenter of the outbreak in central China, the WHO said its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had discussed with Chinese officials \"possible alternatives to evacuation of foreigners if there are ways to accommodate them and protect their health.\"\n\nAlthough Chinese medical workers have described a desperate need for more resources to treat thousands of new patients, state-run Chinese media reported that Dr. Tedros had spoken highly of the Chinese efforts to contain the virus. The Chinese authorities agreed on Tuesday to allow in teams of international experts, coordinated by the World Health Organization, to help with research and containment.\n\nChinese officials said that 106 people had died from the virus. On Monday the number was reported to be 81. The total number of confirmed cases rose sharply to 4,515 on Tuesday from 2,835 the previous day, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nThe youngest confirmed patient is a 9-month-old girl in Beijing. While the majority of confirmed cases were in Hubei, where a number of cities have been put under effective lockdown, an additional 1,800 cases have been diagnosed outside the province, the authorities said.\n\nIn Wuhan, medical workers have cited a lack of masks and kits to test for the virus. China's medical products administration said on Sunday it had approved new virus detection kits to speed detection, but three Chinese medical companies said they did not have the capacity to produce enough of them, according to local news media reports.\n\nMany in Wuhan with symptoms of the virus have not been tested or have been told the hospitals did not have enough test kits, some local residents said.\n\nDuring a visit to Wuhan on Monday, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, promised to provide more equipment, and the local government has begun building new hospitals that it hopes to open in a matter of weeks. But online, many people mocked the government's efforts.\n\nIn indications of the virus's spread beyond China's borders, Thailand reported 14 cases of infection, while the United States and Australia have each confirmed five cases. Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia each said they had confirmed four cases.\n\nWuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 4,500 people in China and a handful in other countries.\n\nJapan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, which has now confirmed six cases, said that the virus had been found in the first Japanese citizen. The ministry said he had worked as a bus driver for two different tour groups from Wuhan. He had no history of traveling to Wuhan.\n\nThe man, who had driven for the tours earlier this month, first reported experiencing chills, a cough and joint pain on Jan. 14. He visited a clinic three days later, but was sent home. On Jan. 22, his joint pain and cough grew worse, and he returned to a health clinic on Saturday, when a chest X-ray showed abnormalities and he was admitted to a hospital. A test confirmed the coronavirus on Tuesday.\n\nGerman officials said Tuesday that they had identified what they believed was the first instance of the virus spreading within Europe. They said a man from Starnberg in Bavaria was infected and was being treated and kept in isolation. The health ministry described him as being in \"good condition\" medically and said it was also monitoring his family and other people who might have been exposed, including in his children's day care center.\n\n\"It was to be expected that the virus would come to Germany,\" Jens Spahn, Germany's health minister, said in a statement on Tuesday. \"But the Bavarian case shows us that we are well prepared.\" He said the risk to Germans remained low.\n\nJapan planned to send a chartered plane to Wuhan on Tuesday night to bring back the first Japanese citizens who wish to be repatriated. At least 13 countries have said they would evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have been transmitted from animals to humans.\n\nBusinesses that operate in China have issued warnings of their own. In a flurry of emails sent in recent days, General Motors, Honeywell, Bloomberg, Facebook and other companies have warned employees not to travel within mainland China.\n\nHoneywell, which has offices and operations across China, said it had restricted travel to some regions, but did not specify which ones. A spokesman for General Motors said the company had issued a global travel ban to China, with only \"business-critical\" travel allowed and only after clearance from a doctor. Bloomberg told its employees in Hong Kong and mainland China to work remotely until further notice and it restricted travel to China and Hong Kong over the next 30 days, according to an email seen by The New York Times.\n\nThe Chinese government has extended the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 3, with some of China's biggest cities telling businesses not to open until the following week. China's biggest technology companies went further, notifying employees to work from home until Feb. 10. NetEase, an internet and entertainment platform, asked employees who were returning from another city to quarantine themselves for 14 days.\n\nInvestors in Asia were gripped on Tuesday with fear about the health of the global economy for a second day, with a widespread sell-off continuing in the markets. Investors dumped stocks in companies thought to be most vulnerable to the effects of the virus.\n\n\"The coronavirus is the No. 1 threat to financial markets currently as global investors are becoming jittery on the uncertainty,\" said Nigel Green, founder of an investment company, the deVere Group.\n\nIn Hong Kong, medical professionals called for additional border checkpoints.\n\n\"The next week or two will be a critical time for the development of the epidemic,\" the faculty at the Chinese University of Hong Kong wrote on its Facebook page. \"We must closely monitor whether there is a community outbreak outside Hubei Province, especially in Hong Kong's neighboring regions.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Chris Buckley, Russell Goldman, Elaine Yu, Raymond Zhong, Austin Ramzy, Sui-Lee Wee, Alexandra Stevenson, Eimi Yamamitsu, Tiffany May, Joseph Goldstein, Jeffrey E.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/briefing/israel-coronavirus-huawei.html", "title": "Your Wednesday Briefing", "body": "Good morning.\n\nWe're covering the reaction to President Trump's Mideast peace plan, Boris Johnson's balancing act on trade and the kindness of strangers in Wuhan.\n\nTrump's Mideast peace plan favors Israel\n\nIsrael's cabinet is set to vote this weekend on plans to unilaterally annex the strategically important Jordan River Valley and all Jewish settlements on the West Bank.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel announced the planned vote on Tuesday, just as President Trump unveiled a long-awaited peace plan that would make Jerusalem the undivided capital of Israel without requiring the country to uproot any West Bank settlements.\n\nThe annexation would establish what the country's leaders have coveted since 1967: a permanent eastern border for Israel along the Jordan River, recognized by the United States. That's certain to further inflame Palestinians.\n\nContext: Mr. Trump's plan offers the Palestinians the possibility of a state with limited sovereignty and essentially dismantles 60 years of bipartisan support for a negotiated process between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nResponse: The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, immediately denounced it as a \"conspiracy deal,\" and none of the United States' Arab allies formally endorsed it.\n\nAnother angle: The announcements by Mr. Trump, who is fighting impeachment charges, and Mr. Netanyahu, who is under indictment, seemed designed to bolster their domestic political fortunes, our national security correspondent writes.\n\nAs coronavirus spreads, travel warnings pile up\n\nGovernments and businesses around the world issued new travel warnings for China on Tuesday, as officials in Germany and Japan reported the first known cases of human-to-human transmission in those countries of a coronavirus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Here's the latest.\n\nNotably, the authorities in Hong Kong said they would suspend high-speed train services between the territory and the mainland, among other measures, starting on Thursday.\n\nDetails: At least 132 people have died from the virus in China, the government said today, and the number of cases there increased to 5,974, up from 4,515 a day earlier. Here's what we know about the virus.\n\nThe science: Researchers are working on a coronavirus vaccine, but it's a slow process. And we look at how bats, which could be the source of the outbreak, carry so many viruses.\n\nGo deeper: The outbreak has blown up the Chinese Communist Party's facade of a unified society, our columnist Li Yuan writes.\n\nOpinion: Elisabeth Rosenthal, a former Times correspondent and emergency room physician, says that washing your hands is the best protection against the new coronavirus.\n\nBoris Johnson's balancing act with Huawei\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain is risking a rift with President Trump with a decision on Tuesday to allow Huawei to be part of Britain's new high-speed 5G wireless network despite American concerns.\n\nThe move could jeopardize Mr. Johnson's efforts to negotiate a new British-American trade deal after Britain formally leaves the European Union on Friday.\n\nBut Mr. Johnson's show of independence played well with British commentators, and experts said he had calculated that the U.S. would not halt intelligence cooperation.\n\nBackground: Britain's membership in the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group, with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the U.S., gives Mr. Johnson's decision added significance. And it comes as Germany is also deciding whether to work with Huawei.\n\nDetails: British officials said intense American arguments that the Chinese telecommunications giant could be used by Beijing were not persuasive, given Britain's plan to limit the use of Huawei's gear to what the officials characterize as \"fringe\" parts of the national 5G network.\n\nIf you have 15 minutes, this is worth itA giant tax heist\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, \"cum-ex trading,\" a monetary maneuver to avoid double taxation of investment profits, enabled hundreds of bankers, lawyers and investors to siphon about $60 billion from state coffers in Germany, France and other European countries.\n\nProponents of cum-ex say it is perfectly legal because no law explicitly says otherwise. But the authorities in Germany call it a form of theft, and they're trying to claw back the money.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nImpeachment trial: A question period for senators begins today, a day after President Trump's legal team finished its oral arguments. A vote on whether to hear witnesses in the trial -- including John Bolton, the former national security adviser -- is expected on Friday.\n\nKenya: The country's high court is expected to rule Thursday on whether a new biometric ID system is constitutional. Civil rights groups say the system, through which nearly 40 million Kenyans have already had their fingerprints and faces scanned, discriminates against minority groups.\n\nKing Albert II: A lawyer for the former Belgian monarch said on Tuesday that the Court of Appeal in Brussels would again hear a case in which the artist Delphine Bo\u00ebl has sought recognition as his biological daughter. King Albert said on Monday that DNA tests showed he was Ms. Bo\u00ebl's biological father.\n\nKobe Bryant: A 2003 rape accusation against the basketball star -- filed years before the #MeToo movement -- ultimately did not change the trajectory of his career. Here's the latest on the helicopter crash that killed Bryant and eight others on Sunday.\n\nSnapshot: Above, skateboarding in Japan. The country's skateboarders are top-notch, and a strong showing at the Olympics this summer in Tokyo could bring the sport out of the shadows of Japanese society.\n\nWhat we're looking at: These photos in The Atlantic of the locust swarms in East Africa. \"For those keeping track of the plagues hitting the planet,\" writes Andrea Kannapell, the Briefings editor.\n\nNow, a break from the news\n\nCook: Farro with crispy mushrooms and sour cream is similar in texture to a risotto, without the constant stirring.\n\nRead: Our former Cairo bureau chief calls \"Black Wave,\" a new book about chaos in the Middle East by Kim Ghattas, a Lebanese-born journalist and scholar, a \"sweeping and authoritative history.\"\n\nGo: Momcations, a getaway designed for tired mothers, are on the rise. While some see it as profiteering, others say it's a sign of \"the mainstream telling moms they deserve a break.\"\n\nSmarter Living: Breaking up with a therapist can be nerve-racking. But doing it with these tips in mind can turn it into an opportunity for growth.\n\nAnd now for the Back Story on ...Reporting in Wuhan\n\nChris Buckley, our chief China correspondent, is reporting this week from the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Mike spoke with Chris by phone.\n\nWhat is it like with these unprecedented restrictions in place?\n\nIt may be difficult to envisage just how thoroughly people have retreated from the streets and from public life. I had to cross one of the big bridges across the Yangtze for my reporting. And there I was, on one of these Chinese share bikes that are everywhere, on an almost completely empty bridge, spanning one of China's biggest cities, crossing its biggest river. And there were just two other people on the bridge.\n\nA lot of people wonder how long the shutdown can last. Even now people are worrying about the jobs they may lose, the businesses that will close, the school semesters that they might miss.\n\nYou've reported that the anger on Chinese social media is intense.\n\nYes, and you hear that here as well. People erupt with a kind of anger and exasperation over how it was that this dangerous pathogen was among them but they didn't understand, in many cases, how serious it was or what was going on until the city was shut down.\n\nBut that's leavened by a sense among many people that the most pressing thing is to get through this crisis -- so that as few people die as possible and life can return to a kind of normality as soon as possible.\n\nWhat else are you seeing there?\n\nYou see a combination of reactions when you approach people to talk. First of all, there's a natural wariness about getting close to anybody. But once you reassure them -- you're outside, at a distance of a good 10 feet -- they can be very open and also very generous.\n\nHow does that compare to the response you normally get?\n\nThe reaction you get as a foreign reporter varies quite a bit across China. But I think these circumstances, where people feel that they -- and, in a sense, we -- are all in this together, and that you're there somehow experiencing this as well, make it easier to create that connection.\n\nThat's it for this briefing. See you next time.\n\n-- Mike and Sarah\n\nThank you\n\nTo Mark Josephson and Eleanor Stanford for the break from the news.

than 250 people have died, with nearly 12,000 infections confirmed.A Chinese doctor who called the virus 'controllable' regrets his words. Travel restraints could disrupt operations at the United Nations.California health officials cast a wary eye.U.S. temporarily bars foreigners who've recently been to China.\n\nThe Trump administration is imposing temporary travel restrictions that bar entry into the United States by any foreign national who has traveled to China in the past 14 days, officials said on Friday.\n\nThe restrictions, a reaction to the coronavirus that has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, will be put into place at 5 p.m. on Sunday. The United States on Friday also declared the coronavirus, which has sickened nearly 12,000 people and has spread to the United States and 21 other countries, a public heath emergency.\n\nFriday's action exempts immediate family members of American citizens and permanent residents.\n\nIn addition, officials said, any United States citizen returning home who has been in the Hubei province of China within the past 14 days -- believed to be the virus's incubation period -- will be quarantined for up to 14 days. Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is in Hubei.\n\nThose who have been to other parts of China within the past 14 days will be subject to \"proactive entry screening\" and up to 14 days of monitoring and self-quarantine.\n\nThe United States will also funnel all flights from China to just a few airports, including Kennedy in New York, O'Hare in Chicago and San Francisco International Airport.\n\nHow Bad Will the Coronavirus Outbreak Get? Here Are 6 Key Factors\n\nHere's what early research says about how the pathogen behaves and the factors that will determine whether it can be contained.\n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the actions were being taken because there were \"a lot of unknowns\" surrounding the virus and its transmission path.\n\n\"The number of cases have steeply inclined with every day,\" Dr. Fauci said.\n\nThe announcement came as major air carriers suspended flights between the United States and mainland China. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines said direct air service would be halted for months, news that rattled the stock market and industries that depend on the flow of goods and people. Qantas followed suit on Saturday, announcing its own suspension of flights to China.\n\nMore than 250 people have died, with nearly 12,000 infections confirmed.\n\nChinese officials on Saturday reported the highest death toll so far in a 24-hour period.\n\n\u25c6 The 46 new deaths in China raised the toll to 259.\n\n\u25c6 About 2,100 new cases were also recorded in the country in the past 24 hours, raising the worldwide total to nearly 12,000, according to Chinese and World Health Organization data. The vast majority of the cases are inside China; about 100 cases have been confirmed in 21 other countries.\n\n\u25c6 All of China's provinces and territories have now been touched by the outbreak.\n\n\u25c6 Countries and territories that have confirmed cases: Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Macau, Russia, France, the United States, South Korea, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Britain, Vietnam, Italy, India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Finland.\n\n\u25c6 Cases recorded in Thailand, Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam, Japan, France and the United States involved patients who had not been to China.\n\n\u25c6 No deaths have been reported outside China.\n\nA Chinese doctor who called the virus 'controllable' regrets his words.\n\nA prominent respiratory expert who originally told Chinese state media that the coronavirus was under control and preventable has admitted that his choice of words was inappropriate.\n\nWang Guangfa, head of the department of pulmonary medicine at Peking University First Hospital in Beijing, compared himself and other medical professionals tackling the outbreak to soldiers walking onto a battlefield.\n\n\"All the bullets are flying,\" said Dr. Wang, in an interview with Jiemian, a finance-focused news site founded by Shanghai United Media Group, which is controlled by the government of Shanghai.\n\nIn many ways the doctor, who has been widely criticized for his reassuring early statements, has come to symbolize how slowly China recognized the urgency of the outbreak. Dr. Wang himself contracted the coronavirus, apparently during a visit to Wuhan.\n\nAs the virus began to spread through Wuhan in early January, people who spoke out about it online were silenced by censors and, in some cases, held by the police, accused of spreading rumors. When journalists from Hong Kong visited a Wuhan hospital, police officers detained them for hours. (The Hong Kong news media were among the first to shed light on the fast-spreading virus.)\n\nDr. Wang initially said that the virus could not be spread by human-to-human contact. But 11 days later, he confirmed to state media that he had the virus, and that he may have contracted it during a trip to Wuhan with a group of experts.\n\nIn his interview with Jiemian, published on Friday, Dr. Wang said he had misdiagnosed himself as having the common flu, and that he had waited days before checking himself into a hospital. He said he had since recovered and was discharged on Thursday.\n\nAsked why he had originally called the coronavirus \"preventable and controllable,\" Dr. Wang blamed limited information at the time of his Wuhan visit. A clearer picture of the virus's transmissibility would have required \"epidemiological data, which is difficult to judge,\" he said.\n\n\"These controversies may have been a kind of misunderstanding,\" Dr. Wang said of the criticism he had received. He also defended his original phrasing, saying that many outbreaks of infectious diseases in history were ultimately controlled in the end.\n\nHis interview has been widely shared on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. Some of the most popular comments are from angry users.\n\n\"'Could be prevented and controlled,' Wang Guangfa,\" said one user, who wrote under a pseudonym based on \"Gorbachev\" in Chinese characters. \"Because of this line, the most critical half-month was squandered! And resulted in this.\"\n\nTravel restraints could disrupt operations at the United Nations.\n\nAround the world, the growing number of restraints on travelers from China because of the coronavirus outbreak has reverberated to the United Nations, a hub of international diplomacy with operations that involve travel in all 193 member states.\n\nIn an advisory issued Friday evening, the organization's headquarters in New York told staff members and their families that \"they may be subjected to travel restrictions and health screening measures implemented by local authorities for travelers entering or exiting the country.\"\n\nWhile United Nations diplomats and other personnel were not banned from traveling, the advisory warned that \"it would be prudent to make contingency arrangements should the need arise.\" A page on the United Nations website provided staff members with practical steps and advice.\n\nCalifornia health officials cast a wary eye.\n\nA third confirmed case of coronavirus in California was announced on Friday, raising questions about the state's vulnerability in the outbreak on the same day the federal government imposed a 14-day quarantine for the 195 people who arrived on an evacuation flight from Wuhan, China.\n\nThe three confirmed cases were in Los Angeles, Orange and Santa Clara Counties. In all, seven cases had been reported in the United States as of Friday night.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, the infected person reported to the authorities that he was feeling unwell as he was traveling back to Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak. The patients in Orange County and Santa Clara County had also traveled to Wuhan.\n\nSonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health, said in a recorded video message that the health risk to the general public in California was low. \"But we still consider this a serious public health concern,\" Dr. Angell said.\n\nThe United States government has imposed a federal quarantine on the 195 people who were evacuated on Wednesday from Wuhan, China, to a California military base, officials said on Friday.\n\nThe group will be held at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, Calif., for 14 days, to ensure that they are not infected with the coronavirus that has sickened more than 9,800 people in China and killed more than 200 people.\n\nReporting was

For some adolescents, it meant a pitch for abstinence; others watched their teachers put condoms on bananas and attempt sketches of fallopian tubes that looked more like modern art.\n\nOn TikTok, sex ed is being flipped on its head. Teenagers who load the app might find guidance set to the pulsing beat of \"Sex Talk\" by Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nA doctor, sporting scrubs and grinning into her camera, instructs them on how to respond if a condom breaks during sex: The pill Plan B can be 95 percent effective, the video explains.\n\nThe video is the work of Dr. Danielle Jones, a gynecologist in College Station, Tex., and so far has racked up over 11 million views. Comments range from effusive (\"this slaps\") to eye-rolling (\"thanks for the advice mom\" and \"ma'am, I'm 14 years old\").\n\n\"My TikTok presence is like if you had a friend who just happens to be an OB/GYN,\" Dr. Jones said. \"It's a good way to give information to people who need it and meet them where they are.\"\n\nDr. Jones is one of many medical professionals working their way through the rapidly expanding territory of TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, to counter medical misinformation to a surging audience. The app has been downloaded 1.5 billion times as of November, according to SensorTower, with an audience that skews young; 40 percent of its users are ages 16 to 24.\n\nAlthough medical professionals have long taken to social media to share healthy messages or promote their work, TikTok poses a new set of challenges, even for the internet adept. Popular posts on the app tend to be short, musical and humorous, complicating the task of physicians hoping to share nuanced lessons on health issues like vaping, coronavirus, nutrition and things you shouldn't dip in soy sauce. And some physicians who are using the platform to spread credible information have found themselves the targets of harassment.\n\nDr. Rose Marie Leslie, a family medicine resident physician at the University of Minnesota Medical School, said TikTok provided an enormous platform for medical public service announcements.\n\n\"It has this incredible viewership potential that goes beyond just your own following,\" she said.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nDr. Leslie's TikToks on vaping-associated lung diseases drew over 3 million views, and posts on the flu and HPV vaccines also reached broad audiences beyond her hospital.\n\nStriking a chord on TikTok, Dr. Leslie said, means tailoring medical messaging to the app's often goofy form. In one post, she advised viewers to burn calories by practicing a viral TikTok dance. She takes her cues from teen users, who often use the app to offer irreverent, even slapstick commentary on public health conversations. She noted one trend in which young TikTokers brainstormed creative ways to destroy your e-cigarette, like running it over with a car.\n\nTikTok's executives have welcomed the platform's uses for medical professionals. \"It's been inspiring to see doctors and nurses take to TikTok in their scrubs to demystify the medical profession,\" said Gregory Justice, TikTok's head of content programming.\n\nDr. Jones, the gynecologist, said she was hopeful the platform could help young people develop trust in medical practitioners and view them as more accessible. \"Back in the old days, there was a town doctor and everyone knew where he lived, and you traded milk and eggs for health care,\" Dr. Jones said. \"You had trust in your doctor because you trusted them as a person first.\" TikTok, she said, can help to humanize doctors -- she's seen that some of her own patients feel more comfortable with her because they have seen her playful social media posts.\n\nBut some doctors are also encountering responses to their videos that they did not expect.\n\nEarlier this month, Dr. Nicole Baldwin, a pediatrician in Cincinnati, posted a TikTok listing the diseases that are preventable with vaccines and countering the notion that vaccines cause autism.\n\nHer accounts on TikTok, Twitter, Facebook and Yelp were flooded with threatening comments, including one that labeled her \"Public Enemy #1\" and another that read, \"Dead doctors don't lie.\"\n\nA team of volunteers that is helping Dr. Baldwin monitor her social media has banned more than 5,200 users from her Facebook in recent weeks.\n\nDr. Baldwin said she started out feeling enthusiastic about the opportunity TikTok provides to educate adolescents, but her experience with harassment gave her some pause.\n\n\"There's a fine line physicians are walking between trying to get a message out that will appeal to this younger generation without being inappropriate or unprofessional,\" Dr. Baldwin said. \"Because of the short content and musical aspect of TikTok, what adolescents are latching onto is not the professional persona we typically put out there.\"\n\nA spate of recent TikToks have further stirred questions about the potential for the app's abuse. One recent TikTok post featured a medical professional speculating -- as she lip synced to the Rex Orange County lyric \"How Could I Ignore You?\" -- that her patient's chest pain could have been caused by cocaine. Another showed an emergency room doctor mocking patients who sought treatment in the E.R. rather than from a primary care physician.\n\nSarah Mojarad, a lecturer who teaches a course on social media for scientists at the University of Southern California, said she has seen physicians either \"bashing their patients\" on the app or \"whitecoat marketing,\" a term that refers to the use of medical prestige to market inappropriate products like unauthorized supplements.\n\nThe youth of TikTok's audience also raises the stakes when medical professionals misuse the platform.\n\n\"With a young audience, it's really important to make sure that the content getting out is professional and accurate,\" Ms. Mojarad said. \"People may think some of it is medical humor, but it impacts care.\"\n\nTikTok's community guidelines state that the platform does not permit \"misinformation that may cause harm to an individual's health, such as misleading information about medical treatments.\" The company expanded its rules of conduct earlier this month, as its user base has grown.\n\nSome physicians worry that TikTok's brief, playful clips can blur the line between general education and patient-specific medical advice.\n\nDr. Austin Chiang, a gastroenterologist and chief medical social media officer at Jefferson Health in Philadelphia, said he has been asked about specific symptoms on TikTok and has to refer users to established medical sources, or directly to their doctors.\n\nDr. Christian Assad, a cardiologist in McAllen, Tex., said he sometimes scripts his TikToks, given the potential for confusion when he compresses a 60-minute talk on low-carbohydrate dieting into a 60-second musical clip.\n\nIgnoring the platform isn't an option, especially given the prevalence of disinformation on the app, Dr. Chiang said. Two of his more popular posts have countered the use of essential oils to cure diseases and exposed the failings of the celery juice fad diet.\n\n\"If we're not there to be a voice for evidence-based medicine, who's going to do that for us?\" Dr. Chiang said. \"Anti-vaxxers are already using social media to their advantage. By putting doctors on social media, we're able to be a source of more accurate information.\"\n\nStill, for doctors turned influencers, the TikTok learning curve can be steep. Dr. Matthew Schulman, a plastic surgeon in New York, said the slightly older users of Instagram and Snapchat have been vital to his private practice, helping to drive roughly 80 percent of consultations. He often streams live from the operating room. \"Buttock augmentation is really popular on social media,\" he said.\n\nBut TikTok has presented him with cause for additional concern. The virality upside is massive: A post he made earlier this month discussing celebrity clients drew over 6.8 million views. But as he has watched his 10-year-old daughter use the app, he realized that he must exercise more caution in producing content.\n\n\"The demographic of TikTok is very young, and as a plastic surgeon I don't feel comfortable marketing my services to children,\" Dr. Schulman said. Simultaneously, he knows the app is growing fast. \"I don't want to be caught playing catch-up. In two or three years the platform could change, and if I already have an established account I'm ahead of the game.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he said, he relies on top-notch TikTok editors -- his kids.",

Coronavirus, Look to the Epidemic Triangle", "body": "Dr. Werb is the author of \"City of Omens: A Search for the Missing Women of the Borderlands.\"\n\nFive cases of the mysterious Wuhan coronavirus have been confirmed in the United States, giving rise to concerns about a potential global pandemic. We've seen this story before, as health authorities working with threadbare data try to walk the line between epidemic readiness and needless panic. Is this new outbreak poised to become the next AIDS pandemic or a new SARS, which was stopped in its tracks after 774 deaths? To cut through the headlines, we can use a simple concept called the \"epidemic triangle.\" Employed by epidemiologists since the discipline's earliest days, it is indispensable in predicting whether localized outbreaks will transform into full-blown epidemics.\n\nThe epidemic triangle is essentially an equation. It posits that every outbreak, regardless of its specific traits, is dependent on the interplay between three factors: the pathogen (the agent causing infection), the host (the organism at risk of infection) and the environment (the setting where the infections occur). Every single epidemic -- be it the flu, cholera or even behavioral epidemics like drunken driving -- is the result of a dynamic shift in one of these points of the epidemic triangle, which then causes a domino effect leading to a sudden explosion of new cases.\n\nIn one classic example of this phenomenon, we have an environmental shift to thank for the emergence of the global flu pandemic. In the mid-16th century, ducks were introduced to Chinese rice paddies to feed on the insects that were destroying crops. That meant ducks joined another common feature of Chinese farms: pigs. The duck's unique biology makes it a generous reservoir for a vast number of viruses, while pigs are uncannily efficient at mixing different viruses together into new strains and passing them to humans. Breeding these two animals in proximity quickly led to the combination and transmission of new viral strains. Novel and highly virulent pathogens -- hybrid pig-duck influenza strains -- then crossed the species barrier and have been tormenting humanity ever since.\n\nThe family of coronaviruses (so-called because they resemble glowing crowns) that includes the new Wuhan strain are exceptionally challenging to control. Coronaviruses are responsible for the common cold, pneumonia and bronchitis, but the coronavirus family is sprawling and includes deadlier outliers like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which have fatality rates of up to 15 percent and 35 percent, respectively. The big question, then, is whether the Wuhan coronavirus is closer to the common cold or to SARS. While its case fatality rate is unknown, as of Wednesday there were more 6,000 confirmed cases worldwide (with about 80 outside of mainland China) and at least 130 people dead.\n\nLast week, the World Health Organization convened a special committee to decide whether to declare a global health emergency. Ultimately, after two days of deliberation, the group decided not to take this major step, though the W.H.O.'s director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted ominously that \"it may yet become one.\" That time may have come: Today, the W.H.O. committee will convene again to determine if the outbreak has crossed a threshold into warranting a designation of a global emergency. As it considers how to proceed, the W.H.O. committee is grappling with a monumental choice -- global health emergencies are legally binding announcements requiring every United Nations member state to take action -- with scant data.\n\nI don't doubt that the epidemic triangle is critical in helping W.H.O. navigate this process. Is this outbreak because of a substantive shift in the genetic makeup of an old pathogen, a change in the vulnerability of the host population or an alteration of the environment that has shaped the threat emanating from Wuhan? As the Wuhan outbreak continues to expand, applying the calculus of the epidemic triangle remains the most reliable way to chart an effective public health response while avoiding a descent into hysteria.\n\nFirst, we need to know how much of a shift this new pathogen is from previous coronavirus strains, based on its infective potential and virulence. Judging from the rapid rise in cases since the first cluster was reported on Dec. 31, the new Wuhan strain could very well be highly infective. For perspective, SARS has a relatively low basic reproductive ratio (or R0) of 0.5, meaning that every two cases of SARS results in only one additional infection. Very early estimates shared by the W.H.O. suggest the Wuhan strain's R0 is 1.4 to 2.5, producing roughly two secondary cases for each initial infection, which places it slightly higher than the seasonal flu (for perspective, measles has a R0 of 12 to 18).\n\nIf the new coronavirus's R0 remains low as more data become available, we can be relatively confident that surveillance and quarantine will stem its spread, though these measures become steadily less effective as the R0 increases. With respect to its virulence, early genomic sequencing of the Wuhan virus suggests, thankfully, that it is only distantly related to SARS (they are only 73 percent identical), meaning that it is likely to be less deadly, though it is too early to say with confidence.\n\nSecond, we have to ask how this outbreak might be explained by a shift in the vulnerability of its host (human beings). What scientists will be looking for here is an indication that those who have died are older or immune-compromised, consistent with the fatalities we see from other common coronavirus infections.\n\nThat leaves the environment, the last point of the epidemic triangle -- and this is where things get complicated. As China's economy has expanded, the number of Chinese citizens taking to the skies has risen astronomically. Much has been made about this week's Lunar New Year celebration, and rightly so: it is the world's largest human migration, with as many as three billion planned trips by car, train and plane within China over a two-week period. The challenges of quarantining during this migration are staggering, though China is better equipped than most countries to carry out draconian public health measures, and has demonstrated its resolve by imposing a lockdown on travel for -- at last count -- more than 50 million of its citizens.\n\nWhere the environment has truly shifted, though, is in China's connections to the rest of the world. In 2005, two years after the first SARS outbreak, there were only 233 international air routes from mainland China. By 2016, international routes had more than tripled to 739, meaning there were far more routes for the virus to take out of the country. During the same period, the number of international air passengers traveling in and out of China exploded from around three million to over 51 million. In short, China's increasingly outward-facing stance has greatly expanded the environment within which the Wuhan coronavirus can propagate. This, among all three of the points of the epidemic triangle, makes predicting the scope of the current outbreak exceedingly complex.\n\nAs we face new epidemic threats, no matter what their origin, we can rely on one constant: Each will ultimately be explained by the interaction of the three points of the epidemic triangle. In the case of the Wuhan coronavirus, what should trouble us the most is the rapid expansion of the environment across which the pathogen can infect its hosts, which maps neatly over China's emergence as a global superpower. It remains to be seen whether the scale of this change is enough to transform it from a SARS-like scare -- a blip in epidemic history -- and into the next Spanish flu.\n\nDan Werb is the author of \"City of Omens: A Search for the Missing Women of the Borderlands,\" an assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases and global public health at the University of California, San Diego, and the director of the Center on Drug Policy Evaluation.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Spreads, Chinese Social Media Fills With Something New: Anger", "body": "SHANGHAI -- Recently, someone following the coronavirus crisis through China's official news media would see lots of footage, often set to stirring music, praising the heroism and sacrifice of health workers marching off to stricken places.\n\nBut someone following the crisis through social media would see something else entirely: vitriolic comments and mocking memes about government officials, harrowing descriptions of untreated family members and images of hospital corridors loaded with patients, some of whom appear to be dead.\n\nThe contrast is almost never so stark in China. The government usually keeps a tight grip on what is said, seen and heard about it. But the sheer amount of criticism -- and the often clever ways in which critics dodge censors, such as by referring to Xi Jinping, China's top leader, as \"Trump\" or by comparing the outbreak to the Chernobyl catastrophe -- have made it difficult for Beijing to control the message.\n\nIn recent days, critics have pounced when officials in the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, wore their protective masks incorrectly. They have heaped scorn upon stumbling pronouncements. When Wuhan's mayor spoke to official media on Monday, one commenter responded, \"If the virus is fair, then please don't spare this useless person.\"\n\nThe condemnations stand as a rare direct challenge to the Communist Party, which brooks no dissent in the way it runs China. In some cases, Chinese leaders appear to be acknowledging people's fear, anger and other all-too-human reactions to the crisis, showing how the party can move dramatically, if sometimes belatedly, to mollify the public.\n\nSuch criticism can go only so far, however. Some of China's more commercially minded media outlets have covered the disease and the response thoroughly if not critically. But articles and comments about the virus continue to be deleted, and the government and internet platforms have issued fresh warnings against spreading what they call \"rumors.\"\n\n\"Chinese social media are full of anger, not because there was no censorship on this topic, but despite strong censorship,\" said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley, and the founder of China Digital Times, a website that monitors Chinese internet controls. \"It is still possible that the censorship will suddenly increase again, as part of an effort to control the narrative.\"\n\nWhen China's leaders battled the SARS virus in the early 2000s, social media was only just beginning to blossom in the country. The government covered up the disease's spread, and it was left to journalists and other critics to shame the authorities into acknowledging the scale of the problem.\n\nToday, smartphones and social media make it harder for mass public health crises to stay buried. But internet platforms in China are just as easily polluted with false and fast-moving information as they are everywhere else. During outbreaks of disease, Beijing's leaders have legitimate reason to be on alert for quack remedies and scaremongering fabrications, which can cause panic and do damage.\n\nIn recent days, though, Beijing seems to be reasserting its primacy over information in ways that go beyond mere rumor control. At a meeting this past weekend between Mr. Xi and other senior leaders, one of the measures they resolved to take against the virus was to \"strengthen the guidance of public opinion.\"\n\nWang Huning, the head of the Communist Party's publicity department and an influential party ideologue, was also recently named deputy head of the team in charge of containing the epidemic, behind only China's premier, Li Keqiang.\n\nChinese officials seem to recognize that social media can be a useful tool for feeling out public opinion in times of crisis. WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging platform, over the weekend said that it would crack down hard on rumors about the virus. But it also created a tool for users to report tips and information about the disease and the response.\n\nInternet backlash may already have caused one local government in China to change course on its virus-fighting policies. The southern city of Shantou announced on Sunday that it was stopping cars, ships and people from entering the city, in a policy that echoed ones in Wuhan. But then word went around that the decision had led people to panic-buy food, and by the afternoon, the order had been rescinded.\n\nNowhere has the local government been the target of more internet vitriol than in Hubei Province, where Wuhan is the capital.\n\nAfter the Hubei governor, Wang Xiaodong, and other officials there gave a news briefing on Sunday, web users mocked Mr. Wang for misstating, twice, the number of face masks that the province could produce. They circulated a photo from the briefing of him and two other officials, pointing out that one of them did not cover his nose with his mask, another wore his mask upside down and Mr. Wang did not wear a mask at all.\n\nOn Monday, social media users were similarly unrelenting toward Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang.\n\nDuring an interview Mr. Zhou gave to state television, commenters in live streams unloaded on him, with one writing: \"Stop talking. We just want to know when you will resign.\"\n\nTop authorities may be deliberately directing public anger toward officials in Hubei and Wuhan as a prelude to their resigning and being replaced. Many other targets within the Chinese leadership seem to remain off limits.\n\nThis month, as news of the coronavirus emerged but Mr. Xi did not publicly address it, people on the social platform Weibo began venting their frustration in veiled ways, asking \"Where's that person?\"\n\nBut even those comments were deleted. So some users started replacing Mr. Xi's name with \"Trump.\" As in, \"I don't want to go through another minute of this year, my heart is filled with pain, I hope Trump dies.\"\n\nOther people hungering to express frustration have taken to the Chinese social platform Douban, which has been flooded recently by user reviews for \"Chernobyl,\" the hit television series about the Soviet nuclear disaster.\n\n\"In any era, any country, it's the same. Cover everything up,\" one reviewer wrote on Monday.\n\n\"That's socialism,\" wrote another.\n\nSome Chinese news outlets have been able to report incisively on the coronavirus. The influential newsmagazine Caixin has put out rigorous reporting and analysis. The Paper, a digital news outlet that is overseen by Shanghai's Communist Party Committee, published a chilling video about a Wuhan resident who couldn't find a hospital that would treat him and ended up wandering the streets.\n\nMr. Xiao, the Chinese internet expert, said the central authorities long gave such outlets special leeway to cover certain topics in ways that official media cannot. But the outlets should not be viewed as independent of the government, he said, calling their coverage \"planned and controlled publicity\" from the authorities.\n\nEven outside the digital realm, it is not hard to find people in China who remain unsure of whether to trust what their government is telling them about the epidemic.\n\nChen Pulin, a 78-year-old retiree, was waiting outside a Shanghai hospital recently while his daughter was inside being tested for the virus. When word of the disease first began trickling out, he immediately had doubts about whether officials were being forthcoming about it.\n\n\"Even now, the government seems to be thinking about the economy and social stability,\" Mr. Chen said. \"Those things are important, but when it comes to these infectious diseases, stopping the disease should come first.\"\n\nLi Yuan contributed reporting from Hong Kong.
