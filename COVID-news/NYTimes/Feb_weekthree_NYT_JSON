At a moment when first-term presidents are typically seeking a stable team to focus on their re-election, President Trump has embarked on a systematic attempt to sweep out officials perceived to be disloyal.\n\nThe headquarters of the nation's intelligence apparatus roiled with the ouster of the acting director Joseph Maguire and his replacement by a sharp partisan amid a dispute over Russian election interference. The Justice Department remained on edge with whispers of further resignations, including perhaps even that of Attorney General William P. Barr, after the president's intervention in a case involving one of his friends. Witnesses from the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump have been summarily dismissed. Dozens of policy experts have been cleared out of the National Security Council staff as part of a restructuring that will mean fewer career professionals in range of the president. A deputy national security adviser dogged by innuendo about disloyalty was exiled to the Energy Department. A Trump appointee's nomination for a top Treasury Department post was pulled. The No. 3 official at the Defense Department was shown the door.\n\nAnd Johnny McEntee, a 29-year-old loyalist just installed to take over the Office of Presidential Personnel and reporting directly to Mr. Trump, has ordered a freeze on all political appointments across the government. He also convened a meeting to instruct departments to search for people not devoted to the president so they can be removed, according to people briefed about the session, and informed colleagues that he planned to tell cabinet secretaries that the White House would be choosing their deputies from now on.\n\n\"Trump appears to be launching the biggest assault on the nation's civil service system since the 1883 Pendleton Act ended the spoils system,\" said Paul C. Light, a New York University professor who has studied presidential personnel.\n\nBut career professionals are not the only ones in the cross hairs. Also facing scrutiny are Republican political appointees considered insufficiently committed to the president or suspected of not aggressively advancing his agenda.\n\nAllies of the president say he should be free to make personnel changes, even if it amounts to shedding people who are not seen as loyal to Mr. Trump.\n\n\"It is not unusual at all that these types of assessments are done and thereafter changes are made,\" said Bradley A. Blakeman, a Republican strategist and former White House official under President George W. Bush.\n\nNonetheless, the tumult and anxiety come at a time when the Trump administration confronts enormous challenges, including the coronavirus outbreak, Iranian and North Korean nuclear development and Russian determination to play a role again in America's next election. Democrats, for example, have questioned whether specific cuts at the National Security Council have hurt the nation's ability to respond if there were a severe coronavirus outbreak in the United States.\n\nMr. Trump has long been obsessed with loyalty, a view only exacerbated by his impeachment and the various investigations over the last three years that have convinced him that he is surrounded by a deep-state enemy within that is leaking, lying and sabotaging his presidency.\n\nHe has also been frustrated by the decision-making process of government, aggravated at competing centers of power that have shaped the modern presidency but have, in his view, hindered his ability to enact policies.\n\nWith a more loyal team in place, he hopes to make more progress on initiatives that have been slow-walked by institutional inertia or resistance like tougher rules on trade and immigration. But it could mean less dissent and less open debate with surviving officials fearing the loss of their jobs if they are seen as stepping out of line.\n\nFrom the beginning, his administration has been a turnstile of people who fall in and out of favor with the president. Including those with \"acting\" designations, he is on his third chief of staff, his fourth national security adviser, his fourth defense secretary, his fifth secretary of homeland security, his sixth deputy national security adviser and his seventh communications director.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, turnover among what she calls Mr. Trump's \"A team,\" meaning his senior staff, has hit 82 percent, more in three years than any of the previous five presidents saw in their first four years. Moreover, the Trump administration has been notable for a high level of serial turnover, with 38 percent of the top positions replaced more than once.\n\n\"Many key departments and White House entities have been hollowed out,\" Ms. Tenpas said. The president has thus been left with acting officials in many key areas. \"He seems completely unbothered,\" she said. \"He claims that actings give him flexibility, but fails to see that temporary leaders cannot advance his policies nearly as well as a Senate-confirmed appointee who has the stature and all the powers to do so.\"\n\nWhile some of the reliance on acting officials owes to a dysfunctional Senate confirmation process, Mr. Trump seems to prefer to keep senior advisers on edge as to whether they will keep their job. Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, a position that does not require Senate confirmation, is finishing his 14th month with an \"acting\" in front of his title for no reason that has ever been publicly articulated and he may be forced out without ever having been granted the full title.\n\nMr. Mulvaney has shrugged it off, saying that anyone who works for Mr. Trump is by definition an acting official who could be dismissed at any time. But the president's refusal to bestow the full title strikes many as a form of ritual humiliation depriving him of stature, influence or job security.\n\nJust a few days ago, Mr. Mulvaney seemed to speak out in a way that caused many to wonder whether he may leave soon, voluntarily or not. During session with the Oxford Union in England, he said that the United States was \"desperate\" for more immigrants and that Republicans seemed to stop caring about rising deficits when Mr. Trump took office. He added that \"I disagree with the president every single day\" but did not talk about it publicly.\n\nThe newest power center at the White House is Mr. McEntee, a former assistant to the president who was fired by the previous chief of staff, John Kelly, but has been brought back as presidential personnel director. Mr. McEntee has made clear that his mission is to establish a more loyal team around the president. His meeting last Thursday with cabinet liaisons in which he called for rooting out disloyal officials was first reported by Axios.\n\nThe ousters have extended beyond impeachment witnesses like Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman and Ambassador Gordon D. Sondland. John C. Rood, who was removed as under secretary of defense for policy, did not speak out publicly but had written internal emails skeptical of the freeze on security aid to Ukraine that was at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn National Security Council staff meetings, however, Mr. Rood was a constant voice of skepticism over the administration's troop reductions in Syria, its pending peace deal with the Taliban and other issues. With Mr. McEntee's arrival, that dissenting voice was no longer welcome, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nSupporters of Jessie K. Liu, a Trump backer who served as the United States attorney in Washington, suspect her nomination for under secretary of Treasury was pulled because of dissatisfaction with her prosecution of Roger J. Stone Jr., the president's adviser convicted of obstruction and witness intimidation to protect Mr. Trump.\n\nVictoria Coates, a deputy national security adviser, was dispatched to the Energy Department despite denials that she was the anonymous official who wrote an op-ed and book critical of the administration.\n\nMr. Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence who angered the president by allowing intelligence officials to tell House lawmakers that Russia was already intervening in the 2020 election on Mr. Trump's behalf, was replaced by Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and a vocal conservative with no background in intelligence.\n\nOne of Mr. Grenell's first moves was to push out Andrew P. Hallman, the popular principal executive, who had been acting as the top deputy. Arriving with Mr. Grenell was Kashyap Patel, a senior National Security Council staff member and former key aide to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nMr. Patel has been viewed warily by intelligence officers especially since news reports that his mandate was to clean house. Some top civil servants told colleagues they were contemplating quitting or feared being fired.\n\nBut Mr. Grenell also began a charm offensive with senior officials and his initial meetings have put some at ease while making others think they should give the new boss a chance. It is also not clear who placed Mr. Patel in the office, with one official saying it was not Mr. Grenell's idea.\n\nSome allies of the administration cautioned against overanalyzing the developments in the intelligence office. Mr. Maguire was scheduled to leave next month anyway under a vacancies law, although administration officials had been looking for ways to extend him, and Mr. Grenell is only temporary while the president comes up with a nominee to send to the Senate. \"The O.D.N.I., I think, is less than meets the eye,\" said James Jay Carafano, a national security scholar at the Heritage Foundation, using the initials for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nEven so, it has added to the wave of concern across the administration, even among Trump appointees. And that may be part of the point. Convinced that so many officials in government have been working against him, Mr. Trump does not mind if they are more than a little unsettled.\n\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Julian E.

More than half of those people are either members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive religious sect, or their relatives or other contacts. Many cases are in the southeastern city of Daegu, which has essentially been placed under a state of emergency.\n\nPrime Minister Chung Sye-kyun on Saturday called the situation \"grave\" and urged citizens to cooperate with the government and avoid large political rallies, which have continued in the capital, Seoul, despite a city ban.\n\n\"The government will sternly deal with acts that interfere with quarantine efforts, illegal hoarding of medical goods and acts that spark uneasiness through massive rallies,\" Mr. Chung warned in a nationally televised address.\n\nThe spike of cases in South Korea and a rising death toll in Iran added to fears that the window to avert a global pandemic was narrowing. The World Health Organization warned African leaders of the urgent need to prepare for the virus; it identified 13 African countries as priorities because of their direct links to China, which still accounts for the vast majority of confirmed infections and deaths.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nOn Sunday, China raised its official numbers to 76,936 cases and 2,442 deaths.\n\nAcross the U.S., a vast containment effort relies on local officials.\n\nSince early February, thousands of people returning to the United States from mainland China have been asked to isolate themselves at home for 14 days. Preventing the spread of infectious disease is the essence of public health work, but the scale of efforts by state and local health departments across the country to contain any potential spread of the coronavirus has rarely been seen, experts said.\n\nLocal health officials check in daily by email, phone or text. They arrange tests for people who come down with symptoms, along with groceries and isolated housing, in some cases. There is no centralized tally in the United States of people being monitored or asked to remain in isolation, and they are scattered across the nation's nearly 3,000 local health jurisdictions.\n\nPeople arriving from mainland China are added each day, while those who have completed 14-day \"self-quarantine\" periods are released from oversight. In California alone, the department of public health has been monitoring more than 6,700 returning travelers from China. Health officials in Washington State have tracked about 800, and officials in Illinois more than 200.\n\nEven as the first of 34 confirmed coronavirus patients in the United States have recovered in recent days, health officials say they are preparing for what some fear could still be a much wider outbreak.\n\nSo far, officials say, the containment effort has been largely orderly. The only known transmission of the virus in the United States has involved people in the same household. But no matter how effective health workers are in monitoring their charges, \"there will always be some leakage,'' said John Wiesman, the secretary of health in Washington State.\n\n\"There is no way, with something this large, that you can make it seal-proof,'' Dr. Wiesman said. While enforcing total compliance with isolation orders may not be possible, he said, \"We have to try for 80 to 85 percent, and hopefully that will work.''\n\nRussian disinformation blames the U.S. for the virus.\n\nState Department officials say that thousands of Russia-linked social media accounts are spreading disinformation about the coronavirus, including a conspiracy theory that the United States is behind the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nAmerican monitors identified the campaign in mid-January. Agence-France Presse first reported on the assessment on Saturday.\n\n\"Russia's intent is to sow discord and undermine U.S. institutions and alliances from within, including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns,\" said Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia.\n\n\"By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response.\"\n\nThe effort was described as being carried out by several thousand Russia-linked accounts on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, which post similar messages at similar times in English, Spanish, French, German and Italian.\n\nFringe theories of uncertain origin have accused China of engineering the virus, including suggestions that it is an escaped bioweapon.\n\nMisinformation about the virus -- whether shared purposefully or unwittingly -- is so rife that the World Health Organization has called it an \"infodemic.\" The W.H.O. has been working with big tech companies to try to quell the flood of rumors and falsehoods.\n\nReporting was contributed by Choe Sang-Hun, Derrick Bryson

From above, it looked like the flip side of skywriting -- as if yellow cursors on the ground were carefully spelling out a message for unseen readers in the clouds.\n\nThe farmers, truckers and others who traverse these rural roads, though, could quickly tell you what the hieroglyphics mean: Help.\n\nLike hundreds of other small agricultural counties and towns around the country, Trempealeau County in central-west Wisconsin is overwhelmed with aging, damaged roads and not enough money to fix them.\n\n\"Our road hasn't been paved since the '60s,\" said Kellen Nelson, whose family owns Triple Brook Farms on County Road O outside Osseo. \"Patching and seal coating is all they've ever done.\"\n\nThe roads look like losers in a barroom brawl. Thick, jagged cracks run down the asphalt like scars, interrupted at points by bruised bumps. In some places, guardrails are tilted off their moorings like a pair of glasses knocked askew.\n\n\"It is not real stable -- the shoulders are eroding in many places,\" Mr. Nelson said. \"When you're going through with an 80,000-pound load of soybeans and meeting cars, that's dangerous.\"\n\nThroughout much of the Midwest and South, the rural transportation system is crumbling. Two-thirds of the nation's freight emanates from rural areas. Traffic volume has increased. And over the years, tractor-trailers and farm equipment have been supersized, ballooning in length, breadth and weight.\n\nA legally loaded semi-trailer truck can produce 5,000 to 10,000 times the road damage of one car according to some estimates, said Benjamin J. Jordan, director of the Wisconsin Transportation Information Center at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Roads and bridges have not kept up.\n\nAlthough just 19 percent of the country's population lives in rural areas, those regions have 68 percent of the total lane and road miles, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\n\"We have less resources to maintain and rehabilitate the road system and it's deteriorating more quickly,\" Mr. Jordan said.\n\nThe state's gas tax, which is dedicated to transportation needs, has been unchanged since 2006. A proposal last year from Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, for an 8-cent increase was voted down by the Republican-led Legislature, which instead raised vehicle title and registration fees.\n\n\"In the last budget, the Legislature and governor did come up with some additional funding,\" said Daniel J. Fedderly, executive director of the Wisconsin County Highway Association. \"But the problem is it's one-time funding and it's not ongoing and it's not sustainable.\"\n\nIn Trempealeau, decades of underfunding have left the county of 29,000 people with roughly $60 million to $80 million worth of road repairs. Generally, there is no state or federal assistance to help cover the costs.\n\n\"The last time we received money to help with road projects was 2008,\" said Al Rinka, commissioner of the county's Highway Department.\n\nThe normal life span of an asphalt road is 30 years. The county's 292 miles of roads are now averaging 74 years.\n\nEmergency closings and weight limits are as common as a sunrise. Farmers can't easily move equipment from one field to another. Truckers must make long detours to deliver feed and fertilizers. Drivers end up with broken axles, wrecked suspension systems or busted tires.\n\nLast March, when the snow melted, inadequate drainage around County Road K near Galesville was so severe that several homes were flooded.\n\nIn November, a school bus slid off a county road outside Arcadia as it navigated a turn and tipped over into a ditch. No one was seriously injured.\n\n\"I get people calling me and screaming at me all the time,\" Mr. Rinka said. \"In 10 years, we're going to start turning roads back into gravel\" if nothing changes.\n\nThis week, temperatures remained below freezing. But when the spring thaw comes, the melting will create soft spots that are easily damaged by traffic.\n\nThe county also has the worst bridges in the state, with the highest proportion -- 6 percent -- given a D rating, requiring tonnage restrictions.\n\nThe repair backlog is long. Mr. Nelson of Triple Brook Farms waited three years before a small bridge near his property was fixed. That meant he had to to drive eight miles to get to fields that were just half a mile away because the crossing couldn't handle the weight of a combine or a tractor. And an emergency weight limit on a bridge on County Road O caused a 12-mile detour each time he sent crops to the grain elevator or river barges.\n\nStill damaged is a 15-ton bridge east of the farm on County Road OO that requires him and his neighbors to reroute their combines and semi-trucks.\n\n\"There are things that we can accept that are beyond our control, like viruses and trade deals,\" Mr. Nelson said, referring to the effects that soybean farmers felt from the coronavirus outbreak and the tariff war with China. \"But when it comes to infrastructure, that's crucial for everyone, not just farmers. All the businesses that are out here rely on quality roads.\"\n\nQuality roads are expensive. Reconstructing a mile costs $300,000, Mr. Rinka said. Chip sealing, a kind of short-term patching, costs $17,000 a mile.\n\nIn November, the Trempealeau County Board of Commissioners approved the largest increase ever in the road budget -- $5 million -- paid for through debt.\n\nWith luck, the added funding will cover 15 miles of reconstruction, nearly four times what would be possible with the department's typical annual budget of $1.2 million to $1.5 million. County Road JJ, where the school bus accident occurred, will get new blacktop. (A new culvert was added to County Road K over the summer.)\n\nWhat's really needed, Mr. Rinka said, is a \"culture change\" in residents and business owners who want good roads but don't want to pay for them.\n\nSomeone will beg to have a road repaired, Mr. Rinka said. \"I'll say, 'O.K., I'll fix your road, and you're going to see an increase in your property tax.'\n\n\"'Oh, no, no,' they say, 'I don't want that.'\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patricia_cohen@nytimes.com", "name": "Patricia Cohen", "type": "author",

Ebola, Now Coronavirus. Why an Omaha Hospital Gets the Toughest Cases.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn the years after the Sept. 11 attacks, officials at Nebraska Medical Center envisioned a time when the nation would need a large, secure treatment center to guard against the threats of bioterrorism and infectious diseases. They spent $1 million to transform an empty wing of the hospital into a 10-bed biocontainment unit, complete with concrete walls, filtered air and video links to the nursing station.\n\nThen they waited.\n\nThe beds sat empty for years, until an Ebola outbreak in 2014. The unit became a central player in treating Americans returning from West Africa with the lethal disease. Nurses wearing face shields, water-resistant gowns and three pairs of surgical gloves treated three Ebola patients. When that threat subsided, the unit returned to being a quiet ward used only for training and planning.\n\nNow, the hospital in Omaha is once again playing a key role in an international health emergency, after 13 Americans who tested positive or were exposed to the new coronavirus on a contaminated cruise ship in Japan were hustled off an international flight and transported there for evaluation on Monday.\n\nIn addition to the biocontainment unit, the hospital's campus has the only federal quarantine unit in the country.\n\n\"We do a huge amount of research in these areas,\" said Dr. Jeffrey P. Gold, chancellor of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, citing work on infectious diseases and research on countermeasures to weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak How Is the U.S. Being Affected?\n\nUpdated Feb.18, 2020\n\nFifteen cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the United States, including a 35-year-old man in Washington State, a couple in their 60s in Chicago and eight people in California. A couple tested positive after returning from vacation in Hawaii. One of the people evacuated from Wuhan last week to San Diego had coronavirus but was discharged because of a labeling error. The outbreak has left some Asian-Americans feeling an unsettling level of public scrutiny. Some evacuees are wondering why they aren't being tested on bases. Pittsburgh, Wuhan's \"sister city,\" has been shaken by the outbreak and is sending aid to relatives and friends trapped in the center of a deadly outbreak. There was a race to contain the disease after one man's cough became confirmation of America's first case. Many who recently traveled to China are isolating themselves in 'self quarantines' for 14 days. A high school exchange student may have been among the last Americans to arrive home in time to avoid the mandated quarantine. Most experts agree: To protect yourself wash your hands and avoid touching your face. Tips to not get sick while traveling. Affected by travel? Or do you know someone who is? Please contact us at coronavirus@nytimes.com if you are willing to be contacted by a reporter or have your comments used for a coming story.\n\n\"What -- heaven forbid -- happens if an employee or staff member gets exposed to one of these agents, or even worse than that, gets infected, where are you going to put them? You can't just call up a local hospital and say, 'I've got somebody who has anthrax, make up a bed,'\" he said. \"You need facilities that can do everything from air and water handling to the complexities of waste disposal.\"\n\nBy Tuesday, hospital officials said they were awaiting additional test results but anticipated that most of the people in the group of 13 would be confirmed as having the coronavirus, the latest development in a sprawling international outbreak which originated in Wuhan, China. The virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in at least two dozen countries.\n\nStill, the risk of infection outside of China remains low, and the virus is considered a less immediate threat than the seasonal flu.\n\nBefore arriving in Omaha, the 13 patients -- all adults -- had been stuck for days aboard a cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan, where Japanese officials have confirmed more than 400 cases of the virus. As officials prepared to evacuate Americans on board, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo told passengers that no one infected with the coronavirus would be allowed to board flights to the United States. But during a chaotic evacuation on Monday, the decision was apparently reversed at the last minute.\n\nOfficials have said that 14 infected evacuees were allowed to board the planes, which flew to military bases in California and Texas. Many of the infected evacuees then continued on for evaluation in Omaha, along with some of their spouses.\n\nThe groups landed in Omaha on Monday morning and traveled in passenger buses to the hospital, along with a police escort.\n\nThe evacuees who arrived were upbeat -- if a bit cold, because of the weather in Nebraska -- and glad to have a few moments of fresh air as they stepped off the plane, said Mike Wadman, a medical director for the National Quarantine Unit. He said some of them had been in interior rooms of the cruise ship and had not been outside for many days.\n\nAt least two of the more seriously ill evacuees were being monitored in the hospital's biocontainment unit, a special ward on the seventh floor where the three Ebola patients were treated in 2014. It looks like a typical hospital ward, but is equipped with special technology, including doors that act like an airlock and a separate area for doctors and nurses to change and shower.\n\nThe other evacuees are being housed across the street in a 20-bed quarantine unit, which opened last year and is a joint venture with the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The rooms resemble something out of a college dorm: beige walls, a single bed, wooden furniture. But each room also comes with exercise equipment, like a stationary bike or a treadmill, to help patients stay active if they are feeling well enough. Patients will stay in quarantine for 14 days if they continue to test negative, and as long as necessary if they have the virus.\n\nOfficials plan to provide books and games to those who want them, similar to what they have done with a group of 57 people who are separately being quarantined at a national guard facility outside Omaha after flying back from Wuhan. Taylor Wilson, a spokesman for Nebraska Medicine, said patients there have sent in requests for entertainment, including a guitar, which was granted, and a game of Twister, which he said was turned down because \"it's probably not the best quarantine activity.\"\n\nTo fight against isolation, patients in the biocontainment rooms also have access to video technology that attaches to a separate room, so they can virtually visit with loved ones without risk of infection, Dr. Gold said.\n\n\"I remember when we had Ebola patients, their families used to come and they used to read stories to their children, they would pray with their wife,\" he said. \"It was quite emotional.\"\n\nNicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_mervosh@nytimes.com", "name": "Sarah Mervosh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocontainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biocontainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Medical_Center", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bioterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_P._Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey P.

That may exact a global toll.Apple cuts sales forecast as the outbreak slows both production and demand.The new virus is deadlier than the one that causes the flu.\n\nAn analysis of 44,672 coronavirus patients in China whose diagnoses were confirmed by laboratory testing has found that 1,023 had died by Feb. 11. That's a fatality rate of 2.3 percent. Figures released on a daily basis suggest the rate has further increased in recent days.\n\nThat is far higher than the mortality rate of the seasonal flu, with which the new coronavirus has sometimes been compared.\n\nIn the United States, flu fatality rates hover around 0.1 percent.\n\nThe new analysis was posted online by researchers at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOver all, about 81 percent of patients with confirmed diagnoses experienced mild illness, the researchers found. Nearly 14 percent had severe cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and about 5 percent had critical illness.\n\nThirty percent of those who died were in their 60s, 30 percent were in their 70s and 20 percent were age 80 or older. Though men and women were roughly equally represented among the confirmed cases, men made up nearly 64 percent of the deaths. Patients with underlying medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes, died at higher rates.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nThe fatality rate among patients in Hubei Province, the center of China's outbreak, was more than seven times higher than that of other provinces.\n\nChina on Tuesday announced new figures for the outbreak. The number of cases was put at 72,436 -- up from 70,548 the day before -- and the death toll now stands at 1,868, up from 1,770, the authorities said.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 73,200 people in China and 25 other countries.\n\nU.S. officials learned cruise ship evacuees were infected at the last minute.\n\nA day before 328 Americans were to be whisked away from a contaminated cruise ship in Japan, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo told passengers that no one infected with the new coronavirus would be allowed to board charter flights to the United States.\n\nBut those plans were hastily changed after the test results for 14 passengers came back positive -- just as they were being loaded onto buses and dispatched to the airport, where two reconfigured cargo jets were waiting to fly them to military bases in California and Texas.\n\nAfter consultations with health experts, the U.S. government decided to let the infected evacuees, who were not yet exhibiting symptoms, board the flights.\n\nThe reversal was the latest chaotic turn in a two-week quarantine of the ship, the Diamond Princess, that has become an epidemiological nightmare.\n\nCambodia's leader is famously complacent about the coronavirus. That may exact a global toll.\n\nWhen Cambodia's prime minister greeted passengers on a cruise ship amid a coronavirus scare on Valentine's Day, embraces were the order of the day. Protective masks were not.\n\nNot only did Prime Minister Hun Sen not wear one, assured that the ship was virus-free, his bodyguards ordered people who had donned masks to take them off. The next day, the American ambassador to Cambodia, W. Patrick Murphy, who brought his own family to greet the passengers streaming off the ship, also went maskless.\n\n\"We are very, very grateful that Cambodia has opened literally its ports and doors to people in need,\" Mr. Murphy said. Five other ports had said no.\n\nBut after hundreds of passengers had disembarked, one later tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nNow, health officials worry that what Cambodia opened its doors to was the outbreak, and that the world may pay a price as passengers from the cruse ship Westerdam stream home.\n\nOfficials are testing those passengers still on the ship, but health authorities may be hard put to trace all the those who have headed back to their home.\n\nApple cuts sales forecast as the outbreak slows both production and demand.\n\nApple said on Monday that it was cutting its sales forecast because of the coronavirus, in a sign of how the outbreak is taking a toll on manufacturing, even at one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe announcement came hours before China announced new figures for the outbreak.\n\nIn a statement, the iPhone maker, which is heavily dependent on factories in China, said its supply of smartphones would be hurt because production was slowed by the outbreak.\n\nNone of the factories that make iPhones are in Hubei Province, the center of the outbreak, but travel restrictions have hindered other parts of the country as well. Production was taking longer than hoped to get back on track after the facilities reopened following the Lunar New Year holiday, the company said.\n\nApple said it was also cutting its sales forecast because demand for its products was being hurt in China. China has been one of the Silicon Valley company's fastest-growing and largest markets.\n\nApple's warning is significant because it is a bellwether of global demand and supply of products. The company said it was \"fundamentally strong, and this disruption to our business is only temporary.\"\n\nReporting and research was contributed by Hannah Beech, Richard C.

Government officials scrambled on Sunday to contain the first major outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe, locking down at least 10 towns near Milan, closing schools and canceling the iconic Venice carnival, as nearly 150 cases were announced in recent days.\n\nThe new cases are mostly in the Lombardy region, which includes Milan, and is one of Italy's most densely populated areas. The spike -- from fewer than five known cases before Thursday -- has quickly made the country the biggest test of whether the virus can be successfully contained in an open European society.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis began in China in late December, and since then, more than 2,000 people have died worldwide, with most of the cases and fatalities in China. The country's authoritarian government has taken extraordinary quarantine measures and imposed stiff restrictions on travel, but has still struggled to contain the virus.\n\nIn Asia, outside China, the hardest hit country has been South Korea, where there have been 602 confirmed infections and six deaths. On Sunday, President Moon Jae-in put the country on the highest possible alert, empowering the government to lock down cities and take other sweeping measures to contain the outbreak.\n\n\"The coming few days will be a critical time for us,\" he said at an emergency meeting of government officials.\n\nThe same challenge now looms for Italy, Europe's fourth largest economy, where the government, a wobbly, and often bickering, coalition between the Democratic Party and the Five Star Movement, has been in disarray for months.\n\nFive Star has often muddied the waters on important health issues, like vaccinations, by embracing conspiracy theories and playing on voter distrust of government. Whether the government can coalesce and snap in place preventive measures to stem the further spread of the virus will be one of the biggest crises it has faced.\n\nThe government response has been aggressive so far, led by the health minister, Roberto Speranza.\n\nRegional and municipal authorities throughout Italy enacted a series of restrictive ordinances after the government issued emergency measures late Saturday night. All public events in the Lombardy region have been canceled, whether \"cultural, leisure, religious or sporting,\" according to an ordinance issued by Attilio Fontana, president of the Lombardy region, drafted with the health ministry. Museums have been ordered to shut their doors.\n\nMany other venues in Lombardy, aside from those providing essential services, have been closed, including most bars, night clubs and movie theaters, as well as churches. In some other regions, similar closings took place.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air.

What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\n\"We invite people to stay at home, to try and contain this phenomenon that we still don't know, except that it isn't aggressive but moves quickly,\" Giulio Gallera, the official responsible for health for the Lombardy region, said during a televised news conference Sunday.\n\nIn Lombardy, 10 towns were locked down after a cluster of cases emerged in the town of Codogno, about 60 kilometers southeast of Milan. At least 50,000 people are affected by the lockdown. Residents were supposed to leave or arrive only with special permission.\n\nOn Sunday, police and armed forces personnel were deployed to monitor the entrances to the towns.\n\n\"Maximum precaution has been taken to protect citizens,\" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy wrote on Twitter Sunday.\n\nTwo military structures in Lombardy were being prepared to become isolation camps, while other military sites and hotels have been identified throughout the country. A military base in Rome has been housing evacuees from Wuhan, China, where the virus began, and the Italian passengers of the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that has been under quarantine in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nThe outbreak in Codogno began after a 38-year old man known as \"patient one\" was admitted and diagnosed with the virus to the city's hospital on Thursday. But the man had developed symptoms perhaps five days before that, potentially allowing the virus to spread.\n\nEven more disconcerting is that health officials still don't know how he contracted the virus because he had not been to China. But many cases in Lombardy, officials say, may be traceable to that one case.\n\nAt least five members of the hospital medical staff in Codogno and several patients have been infected. Other persons who tested positive include the man's pregnant wife, a close friend, and others who spent time with them. The towns surrounding the ones where the man works and lives have been included in the shutdown.\n\nSimilar lockdown procedures will be applied if new clusters emerge anywhere in Italy, officials said. According to the government decree, local officials are obliged to \"take all appropriate containment measures\" in the case that someone has tested positive for the virus and the source of the contagion is unknown.\n\nQuarantine measures will also be applied to anyone who has close contact with someone who has the virus.\n\nMr. Gallera, the health official for Lombardy, said hospitals were increasing intensive care facilities, and hotels and other structures were being identified as possible venues to isolate people with the virus.\n\n\"We are acting preemptively\" to avoid managing a bigger emergency, he said.\n\n\"We are trying to contain a phenomenon, but it's not a pandemic,\" said Mr. Gallera.\n\nThe presidents of other northern Italian regions suspended all educational activities -- from preschool through universities -- for varying periods of time. In Milan, mayor Giuseppe Sala announced that schools would be closed for a week.\n\nAt least two trade fairs in Milan, cornerstones of the Lombard city's economy, were postponed to a later date, though most of the women's fashion shows, continued on schedule. Giorgio Armani held his show behind closed doors, to an empty room, live streaming the event instead.\n\nCarnival is one of Venice's major annual events and the canceling of events caught off guard many tourists who had thronged to the city before Tuesday's final Mardi Gras celebration.\n\nTwo elderly people who tested positive to the coronavirus were in intensive care at Venice's municipal hospital.\n\n\"The couple did not have contacts with the Chinese community,\" Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto region, said, according to Italian media reports.\n\nAlso Sunday, the patriarch of Venice, the Reverend Francesco Moraglia, suspended all religious ceremonies, including Ash Wednesday celebrations that mark the beginning of Lent.\n\nSo far, three people have died from the virus including a 78-year-old man from Veneto who died Friday and an elderly woman who died in Crema on Sunday.\n\nThe third, a 77-year-old woman died in her home in the town of Casalpusterlengo, Lombardy, and tested positive for the virus posthumously. But Mr. Gallera told reporters Saturday that her health was compromised and that she may have died from other causes.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

"Opinion | China's Health Failures Distract Us From Our Own", "body": "America's health system has long been a mess, and Trump is making it worse.\n\nPresident Trump praises a \"strong, sharp and powerfully focused\" Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak. \"President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation,\" Trump said.\n\nThis offended some Americans. At a time when many Chinese are criticizing Xi for initially covering up the outbreak, should America's president really side with a dictator who punished doctors rather than listening to them?\n\nThat critique seems right to me. But a focus on China's failures or on Trump's praise risks distracting from our own failures in health care -- and this is where Trump's actions have been more destructive than his words. He has proposed enormous budget cuts for Medicaid, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; if carried out, these would leave the U.S. more vulnerable to a pandemic.\n\nBut whatever happens with the coronavirus, America's health system is a mess. That is a consequence of failures that go way back, and Trump is now compounding them. In particular, his lawsuit to destroy Obamacare without offering anything to take its place is the height of irresponsibility; it's not policy but vandalism.\n\nAlready, Trump's policies have led to the loss of health insurance for 400,000 children. Imagine that your child is crying from an ear infection or a toothache and you have no doctor to go to. Or you're worried that your daughter is slow to speak or your son isn't growing properly. What are you supposed to do?\n\nI've written scathing columns about Xi's bungling of the coronavirus outbreak, but we Americans live in a glass house. A newborn in Beijing has a longer life expectancy (82 years) than a baby born in Washington, D.C. (78), or New York City (81).\n\nDemocrats' internecine battle over so-called Medicare for all is largely irrelevant, because the plan won't get through Congress. What's imperative is simply achieving universal medical and dental coverage, either by a single-payer system (like Britain's) or a multipayer system (like Germany's); both work fine. What matters is the universal part.\n\nIn some ways, America's health care is outstanding. Specialized anti-cancer treatments are saving lives. But over all our system has two fundamental flaws.\n\nFirst, outcomes are mediocre and inequitable. Rich Americans live 20 years longer than poor Americans, and low-income American men have approximately the longevity of men living in Sudan. Several American counties have a shorter life expectancy than Cambodia does.\n\nWe're bad at simple things, like vaccinating children. Rwanda has a higher share of girls vaccinated to prevent cervical cancer than the United States does.\n\nOne study found that 21,000 American children's lives would be saved each year if we only had the same mortality rates as the rest of the rich world. So two American kids die each hour because we have worse child survival rates than our peer countries.\n\nIn my reporting, I've been struck by how much more widespread dental pain is in America than in other countries. Some 74 million Americans don't have dental coverage, about four times as many as lack medical insurance. When their teeth rot, they suffer constant excruciating, debilitating pain that should be unfathomable in a country as rich as ours.\n\nHealth care in the United States is \"a moral morass,\" a question of our \"soul,\" Uwe Reinhardt, a brilliant health economist at Princeton wrote in \"Priced Out,\" a book recently published posthumously.\n\nThe second fundamental problem with our health care system is that it delivers these second-rate outcomes at enormous cost. \"Prices for virtually any health care product or service in the United States tend to be at least twice as high as those for comparable products or services in other countries,\" Reinhardt wrote.\n\nWe spend an average of more than $10,000 per person on health care each year, more than twice what France, Canada and Japan each spend (even though the French, Canadians and Japanese all live longer). An excellent forthcoming book by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, \"Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism,\" argues that this discourages hiring of low-income workers. The average cost of a family health insurance policy is $20,000, which is a reason for a company not to hire a junior employee and assume insurance costs.\n\n\"Unless costs are somehow reined in, the long-run prospects for less-educated Americans remain bleak,\" Deaton warns.\n\nSadly, health professionals are part of the problem. Dentists have fought the licensing of dental therapists, who can perform simple procedures more cheaply. And doctor groups limit medical training and qualified foreign physicians to keep prices high; that's why there are fewer doctors per capita in the United States than in peer countries. As Case and Deaton write: \"The industry that is supposed to improve our health is undermining it.\"\n\nThis year's election should in part be a debate about all these issues, and the coronavirus anxiety should remind us of the dysfunction of our own health system. Let's hold China accountable -- but we Americans should also look unflinchingly in the mirror.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

These Citizens Are Fighting Back.", "body": "Information about the coronavirus outbreak is not immune from Chinese censors. But more and more citizens are dodging censorship by creating a digital archive of deleted posts. They told us how.\n\nVoices like these from Chinese citizens are very rare. People who are willing to speak out about the government's attempts to control news about the deadly Coronavirus. They asked to remain anonymous, because what they're doing could put them and their families at great risk. But these people are part of a new wave of Chinese citizens, fighting to get the message out in a country that aggressively censors information. Accounts or messages like these calling for free speech are quickly scrubbed from the internet. Or videos like this, showing people frustrated about life under lockdown. [CLANGING] Posted online one day, but gone the next. But the crisis over the Coronavirus is changing the landscape, for now at least. Everyday citizens are preserving and reposting information the government doesn't want out there. Experts say this kind of digital resistance is happening at a scale they've never seen before. Social media networks like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are blocked in China. But internet savvy people use techniques that allow them to repost censored content to these platforms, while staying under the radar of authorities. They're creating a visual archive by preserving videos like this one, showing overwhelmed hospitals. [SCREAMING] And they're reposting people's personal stories. Some are also turning to less obvious platforms, including GitHub, which is a site mostly used by coders. Another taboo Chinese citizens are pushing back on? They're making open and widespread calls for freedom of speech. These were triggered by the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. He was an early whistleblower who warned about the virus, and was punished by officials for speaking out. He died in early February from the Coronavirus. Right after his death, the hashtag \"I want freedom of speech\" started to trend on Weibo, a Chinese social media site. Then, it was quickly censored by the government. Dr. Li's become an icon in the online fight for freedom of speech between censors and citizens. So, who's winning? For now, citizens are staying a step ahead of the authorities. But a renewed government crackdown could test the strength of this digital resistance.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Censorship in China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Archive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New wave music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Wenliang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Li Wenliang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet censorship in China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.li", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": ".li"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GitHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sina Weibo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Research", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Research", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Internet", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Tool_Kits", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Tool Kits", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/world/asia/thumbnail_corona_censored-1/thumbnail_corona_censored-1--videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 2305}, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 2305, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1451544289", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-18", "time": "01:11:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-18T01:11:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-18T01:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/world/asia/coronavirus-westerdam-cambodia-hun-sen.html", "title": "Cambodia's Coronavirus Complacency May Exact a Global Toll", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nSIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia -- When Cambodia's prime minister greeted passengers on a cruise ship amid a coronavirus scare on Valentine's Day, embraces were the order of the day. Protective masks were not.\n\nNot only did Prime Minister Hun Sen not wear one, assured that the ship was virus-free, his bodyguards ordered people who had donned masks to take them off. The next day, the American ambassador to Cambodia, W. Patrick Murphy, who brought his own family to greet the passengers streaming off the ship, also went maskless.\n\n\"We are very, very grateful that Cambodia has opened literally its ports and doors to people in need,\" Mr. Murphy said.\n\nBut after hundreds of passengers had disembarked, one later tested positive for the coronavirus. Now, health officials worry that what Cambodia opened its doors to was the outbreak, and that the world may pay a price as passengers from the cruse ship Westerdam stream home.\n\nBefore the Westerdam docked in Sihanoukville, fearful governments in other countries had turned the ship away at five ports of call even though the cruise operator, Holland America, assured officials that the ship's passengers had been carefully screened.\n\nPrime Minister Hun Sen's decision to allow it entry appeared to be a political calculus as much as anything else. The region's longest-serving ruler and a close ally of China, he is known for his survival skills.\n\nBut Mr. Hun Sen's critics worry that the aging autocrat might have acted rashly.\n\n\"Of course, he had to do the dictator thing: photo op, roses, exploit this for its maximum value,\" said Sophal Ear, an expert in Cambodian politics at Occidental College. \"Whatever is in the best interest of Cambodians is completely irrelevant to him.\"\n\nIt is too early to tell whether the decision to let hundreds of passengers from the Westerdam fly off has the makings of an epidemiological disaster. Cambodian health authorities said that 409 of the 2,257 passengers and crew had left Cambodia for their homes scattered across the globe. The rest remain in hotels in Phnom Penh, the capital, or on the ship.\n\nBut deficiencies in screening for the coronavirus aboard the ship, along with continued complacency about the epidemic in Cambodia, are raising fears this small Southeast Asian nation could prove to be a surprising vector of transmission for a virus that has already killed more than 1,700 people, mostly in China, the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nMany health experts urge people who have been in contact with coronavirus patients to self-quarantine for 14 days, lest they add another spoke to the contagion network.\n\nBut on Monday, Mr. Hun Sen directed officials in Phnom Penh to treat passengers from the Westerdam to a sightseeing jaunt.\n\n\"To tour the city is better than staying in rooms or at the hotel feeling bored or scared,\" said a post on Mr. Hun Sen's Facebook page.\n\nThe lack of urgency in Cambodia, where officials milled around the ship on Monday without protection, points to the obstacles in trying to contain a virus that experts warn is spreading faster than SARS or MERS.\n\n\"This is influenza-like transmission,\" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \"It's like trying to stop the wind.\"\n\nLast week, when the Westerdam docked in Sihanoukville, the Cambodian government and the cruise operator deemed the vessel virus-free.\n\nThe declaration was at a minimum premature.\n\nOnly 20 people out of the 2,257 onboard were tested for the virus before disembarking, and that was because they had reported themselves to ship medical staff with various ailments.\n\nThe woman who twice tested positive after traveling on to Malaysia, an 83-year-old American, was not among those 20, Holland America said.\n\nHealth monitoring for the rest of the passengers was limited to a handful of temperature checks conducted with infrared thermometers, passengers said. In a statement, Holland America said that during one of those screenings, not a single person on board recorded an elevated temperature.\n\nOn Monday, an announcement broadcast to passengers remaining on the Westerdam warned that they should avoid the ship's hot deck and return to their air-conditioned rooms to avoid falsely high temperature readings.\n\nSome health experts have questioned the efficacy of infrared thermometers, also known as temperature guns, saying they measure the heat emanating from the surface of the body, rather than core body temperature.\n\nVarious environmental factors can distort thermometer gun reading, said Gary Strahan, who runs a small infrared device company in Texas.\n\n\"In Cambodia, you have warmer background temperatures,\" he said. \"It could impact the measurement. That's the issue with any noncontact thermometer.\"\n\nEven if temperatures are accurately gauged, people may be taking medication that lower their temperature, like some arthritis drugs.\n\nAnd in any case, people who are asymptomatic can still pass on the coronavirus, scientists have found.\n\n\"A person who does not present as feverish is not necessarily uninfected with a disease or a virus,\" said Jim Seffrin, an expert on infrared devices at the Infraspection Institute in New Jersey.\n\nIn the wake of the positive test in Malaysia, Cambodian health officials said they would be relying on a domestic lab to test all passengers and crew members still in the country for the coronavirus.\n\nOn Monday evening, passengers celebrated news from Cambodian health officials that a first batch of 406 people in Phnom Penh had tested negative, although there was no certainty they would not later test positive.\n\n\"People on the ship are very grateful to the people of Cambodia,\" said Tammie Graves, an American from Kansas. \"I was a bit worried that they might be afraid of us, even at the hotel, but it hasn't been like that at all.\"\n\nOn Monday afternoon, more than 100 Westerdam passengers took up Mr. Hun Sen's offer of a capital tour, piling in buses to see the royal palace and other sites.\n\nIn pictures of the excursion, posted on a government-linked website, only one person can be seen wearing a mask.\n\nDespite cases of coronavirus popping up in Southeast Asia, Mr. Hun Sen has campaigned against masks, arguing that they are better at spreading fear than stopping germs. At a news conference last month, he announced that he would kick out anyone who dared wear a mask.\n\nEven as other governments instituted China travel bans that angered Beijing, Mr. Hun Sen traveled to the Chinese capital and met with Xi Jinping, China's leader, in another photo op.\n\nAnd as other countries organized airlifts of people trapped in Wuhan, the city where the virus is believed to have originated, Mr. Hun Sen said he would not ferry Cambodian students home because they should be \"joining with Chinese to fight this disease.\"\n\nThe sense of solidarity makes sense in a country heavily dependent on China for its fortunes, after having turned its back on a West that was demanding progress in human rights in return for aid and investment.\n\nA torrent of Chinese cash has remade Cambodia, nowhere more so than in Sihanoukville, a once sleepy beach town that is now a sprawling construction site of gilded casinos and towering residential blocks. More than 90 percent of businesses in the city are now Chinese owned.\n\nOn Monday, Oeun Yen, a masseuse here, worried about the massages she had given three female passengers from the Westerdam before the virus case was confirmed by Malaysia. She was not afraid at first, she said, because the prime minister had assured people all was fine.\n\n\"Now I am more concerned,\" she said.\n\nIn a country where Mr. Hun Sen has dissolved the biggest opposition party and political assassination is not uncommon, such mild concern is as much as many ordinary residents are willing to muster.\n\nBut there is also widespread skepticism of the government's contention that only one person in Cambodia has so far tested positive for coronavirus, a Chinese citizen who has since returned home.\n\n\"There is a natural lack of credibility and trust associated with the Cambodian government,\" said Ou Virak, a human-rights activist and founder of the Future Forum, a local think tank. \"This is Hun Sen's Westerdam problem, because even if he was doing the right thing, purely as a humanitarian, he will be seen as the puppet of China instead.\"\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Hun Sen announced yet another publicity stunt: He wants to invite the passengers of the Westerdam to a party.\n\nMasks won't be welcome.\n\nReporting was contributed by Sun Narin in Sihanoukville; Roni Caryn Rabin and David Yaffe-Bellany in New York; and Richard C.

The virus's genome was sequenced within two weeks or so of its appearance, but for many weeks more, we didn't know what to call it or the disease it causes.\n\nFor a time, in some quarters, the disease went by \"Wuhan pneumonia,\" after the city in central China where the first human infections were detected. But guidelines from the World Health Organization, which christened COVID-19 recently, discourage naming diseases after locations or people, among other things, to avoid \"unintended negative impacts by stigmatizing certain communities.\"\n\nIndeed. On Jan. 29, an Australian tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch featured on its front page a red face mask stamped with \"Chinese Virus Pandamonium\": The emphasis on \"panda\" was the paper's doing, so the misspelling it highlighted presumably was deliberate, too. A Chinese student in Melbourne protested in an op-ed in another paper, \"This virus is not 'Chinese.'\"\n\nOf course, the virus isn't Chinese, even if its origin eventually is traced back to a cave in China; nor is the disease that it causes.\n\nEpidemics, on the other hand, are often societal or political -- much like famines are usually man-made, even though droughts occur naturally.\n\nAs far as the current outbreak goes, two cultural factors help explain how the natural occurrence of a single virus infecting a single mammal could have cascaded into a global health crisis. And now for the controversial aspect of this argument: Both of those factors are quintessentially, though not uniquely, Chinese.\n\nThe first is China's long, long history of punishing the messenger.\n\nEight medical doctors were detained by the police in Wuhan in early January on charges of spreading rumors after they flagged on social media the risks of a possible viral outbreak. One of them died recently after being infected with COVID-19.\n\nSimilarly, the epidemic of SARS -- which is caused by another coronavirus -- that broke out in southern China in late 2002 was covered up by local authorities for more than a month, and the surgeon who first sounded the alarm was held in military detention for 45 days.\n\nIn 2008, a scandal erupted over tainted baby formula, after major Chinese producers were found to have added melamine to milk powder. (Six infants died; 54,000 had to be hospitalized). Four years later the whistle-blower credited with first exposing the problem was stabbed to death under mysterious circumstances.\n\nThese are recent examples, but that doesn't mean they should be pinned solely on the Chinese Communist Party: The practice of punishing whoever brings embarrassing truths has been the order of the day since at least the time of Confucius, in the sixth century B.C.\n\nThe sage took a page from an even more ancient tract, \"The Classic of Poetry\" (also known as \"The Book of Songs\"), a collection of songs and poems dating to the 10th century B.C. or before, and adopted a rule from it: \"To Manifest the Way, First Keep Your Body Safe.\" (\u660e\u54f2\u4fdd\u8eab) That may sound innocuous enough, until you consider the fate of one of Confucius's beloved students, Zi Lu (\u5b50\u8def), also known as Zhong You (\u4ef2\u7531), after he ran afoul of the precept: For trying to rebuke a usurper in a power struggle between feudal lords, he was killed and his body was minced. (It is said that Confucius never ate ground meat again.)\n\nIn the third century, the maxim took on some literary flair and a cynical didactic twist in an essay on fate by the philosopher Li Kang (\u674e\u5eb7): \"The tree that grows taller than the forest will be truncated by gales\" (\u6728\u79c0\u4e8e\u6797\uff0c\u98a8\u5fc5\u50ac\u4e4b). This, in turn, eventually gave rise to the more familiar modern adage, \"The shot hits the bird that pokes its head out\" (\u69cd\u6253\u51fa\u982d\u9ce5).\n\nAdmittedly, China's rulers occasionally solicit honest views from their subjects -- but only of a certain kind or usually for a limited time. Mao Zedong, in his \"Hundred Flowers\" or \"Big Voices, Big Gripes\" (\u5927\u9cf4\u5927\u653e) campaign of late 1956 and early 1957, called for the facts and critical opinions to be freely proffered. A few months later came the Anti-Rightist Movement (\u53cd\u53f3\u904b\u52d5) -- during which hundreds of thousands of educated people who had spoken out were sent to jail, forced into exile or subjected to years of mistreatment, their careers and families destroyed.\n\nPunishing people who speak the truth has been a standard practice of China's ruling elite for more than two millenniums and is an established means of coercing stability. It is not an invention of modern China under the Communists -- although the party, true to form, has perfected the practice. And now, muzzling the messenger has helped spread the deadly COVID-19, which has infected some 75,000 people.\n\nA second cultural factor behind the epidemic are traditional Chinese beliefs about the powers of certain foods, which have encouraged some hazardous habits. There is, in particular, the aspect of Chinese eating culture known as \"jinbu,\" (\u9032\u88dc) meaning, roughly, to fill the void. Some of its practices are folklorish or esoteric, but even among Chinese people who don't follow them, the concept is pervasive.\n\nIt is better to cure a disease with food than medicine, so starts the holistic theory. Illnesses result when the body is depleted of blood and energy -- though not the kind of blood and energy studied in biology and physics, but a mystic version.\n\nFor men, it is most important to fill the energy void, which is related to virility and sexual prowess; for women, the stress is on replacing blood, which improves beauty and fertility. Rare plants and animals from the wild are thought to bring the best replenishment, especially when eaten fresh or raw. Winter is said to be the season when the body needs more \"jinbu\" foods. (Could that help explain why both SARS and the current epidemic broke out during that time of year?)\n\nHard-core believers in \"jinbu\" seem to buy into this notion, too: \"Like-shapes eaten strengthen like-shapes\" (\u4ee5\u5f62\u88dc\u5f62), with the word \"shapes\" sometimes referring to human organs and their functions. Adherents count as favorites a long list of exotic foods -- whose methods of procurement or preparation can be outright cruel, with some simply too revolting to describe here.\n\nI've seen snakes and the penises of bulls or horses -- great for men, the theory goes -- on offer at restaurants in many cities in southern China. Bats, which are thought to be the original source of both the current coronavirus and the SARS virus, are said to be good for restoring eyesight -- especially the animals' granular feces, called \"sands of nocturnal shine\" (\u591c\u660e\u7802). Gallbladders and bile harvested from live bears are good for treating jaundice; tiger bone is for erections.\n\nMore mundane yet no less popular is the palm civet (\u679c\u5b50\u72f8), a small, wild quadruped suspected of having passed on the SARS virus to humans. When stewed with snake meat, it is said to cure insomnia.\n\nLess wealthy people might turn to dog meat -- preferably a dog that has been chased around before being slaughtered, because some people believe that more \"jinbu\" benefits are reaped from eating an animal whose blood and energy ran high. Similarly, it is thought that animals killed just before serving are more \"jinbu\" potent, which is one reason the more exotic offerings in wet markets tend to be sold alive -- also making them more potent vectors for any virus they might carry.\n\nEating exotic wildlife has long been endorsed by scholars and elevated to mystical heights, including in the medical treatise \"The Inner Bible of the Yellow Emperor\" (\u9ec3\u5e1d\u5185\u7d93), written some 2,000 years ago and still revered by many health-conscious Chinese today. Beliefs surrounding the health benefits of certain wildlife foods -- which are discussed in newspaper columns and on numerous dedicated internet sites, as well as taught in China's medical schools -- permeate the culture.\n\nTrue, these practices are not legion across China. Nor are they uniquely Chinese: Many peoples in many other countries eat exotic foods, too. But what is notable about China is that these beliefs about the special powers of some foods have been accepted, are now a given, even among people who do not put them into practice. They have become firmly embedded in the Chinese collective consciousness.\n\nAnd so there are strong reasons to say that the current outbreak of COVID-19 has been aided by two fundamentally Chinese cultural practices. This may be discomfiting to hear; the notion might even strike some people as offensive. But it is necessary to investigate all the causes behind this deadly epidemic, whatever their nature -- because if we don't, we will only be inviting the next one.\n\nYi-Zheng Lian, a commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs, is a professor of economics at Yamanashi Gakuin University in Japan and a contributing Opinion writer.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/health/coronavirus-men-women.html", "title": "The Coronavirus Seems to Hit Men Harder Than Women. Why?", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe coronavirus that originated in China has spread fear and anxiety around the world. But while the novel virus has largely spared one vulnerable group -- children -- it appears to pose a particular threat to middle-aged and older adults, particularly men.\n\nThis week, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published the largest analysis of coronavirus cases to date. Although men and women have been infected in roughly equal numbers, researchers found, the death rate among men was 2.8 percent, compared with 1.7 percent among women.\n\nMen also were disproportionately affected during the SARS and MERS outbreaks, which were caused by coronaviruses. More women than men were infected by SARS in Hong Kong in 2003, but the death rate among men was 50 percent higher, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nSome 32 percent of men infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome died, compared with 25.8 percent of women. Young adult men also died at higher rates than female peers during the influenza epidemic of 1918.\n\nA number of factors may be working against men in the current epidemic, scientists say, including some that are biological, and some that are rooted in lifestyle.\n\nWhen it comes to mounting an immune response against infections, men are the weaker sex.\n\n\"This is a pattern we've seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract -- men can have worse outcomes,\" said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n\"We've seen this with other viruses. Women fight them off better,\" she added.\n\nWomen also produce stronger immune responses after vaccinations, and have enhanced memory immune responses, which protect adults from pathogens they were exposed to as children.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\n\"There's something about the immune system in females that is more exuberant,\" said Dr. Janine Clayton, director of the Office of Research on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nBut there's a high price, she added: Women are far more susceptible to autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, in which the immune system shifts into overdrive and attacks the body's own organs and tissues.\n\nNearly 80 percent of those with autoimmune diseases are women, Dr. Clayton noted.\n\nThe reasons women have stronger immune responses aren't entirely clear, and the research is still at an early stage, experts caution.\n\nOne hypothesis is that women's stronger immune systems confer a survival advantage to their offspring, who imbibe antibodies from mothers' breast milk that help ward off disease while the infants' immune systems are still developing.\n\nA stew of biological factors may be responsible, including the female sex hormone estrogen, which appears to play a role in immunity, and the fact that women carry two X chromosomes, which contain immune-related genes. Men, of course, carry only one.\n\nExperiments in which mice were exposed to the SARS coronavirus found that the males were more susceptible to infection than the females, a disparity that increased with age.\n\nThe male mice developed SARS at lower viral exposures, had a lower immune response and were slower to clear the virus from their bodies. They suffered more lung damage, and died at higher rates, said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology at the University of Iowa who was the senior author of the study.\n\nWhen researchers blocked estrogen in the infected females or removed their ovaries, they were more likely to die, but blocking testosterone in male mice made no difference, indicating that estrogen may play a protective role.\n\n\"It's an exaggerated model of what happens in humans,\" Dr. Perlman said. \"The differences between men and women are subtle -- in mice, it's not so subtle.\"\n\nHealth behaviors that differ by sex in some societies may also play a role in disparate responses to infections.\n\nChina has the largest population of smokers in the world -- 316 million people -- accounting for nearly one-third of the world's smokers and 40 percent of tobacco consumption worldwide. But just over 2 percent of Chinese women smoke, compared with more than half of all men.\n\nChinese men also have higher rates of Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, both of which increase the risk of complications following infection with the coronavirus. Rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are almost twice as high among Chinese men as among women.\n\nIn the United States, women are more proactive about seeking health care than men, and some small studies have found the generalization applies to Chinese students at universities in the United States, as well.\n\nIn unpublished studies, Chinese researchers have emphasized that patients whose diagnoses were delayed, or who had severe pneumonia when they were first diagnosed, were at greatest risk of dying.\n\nOne study of 4,021 patients with the coronavirus emphasized the importance of early detection, particularly in older men. And men have been turning up in hospitals with more advanced disease.\n\nBut in areas of China outside Hubei Province, the disease's epicenter and where the majority of those affected are concentrated, the patterns are different: The disease appears to have dramatically lower mortality rates, and men are being infected at much higher rates than women, according to the Chinese C.D.C. analysis.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nMen may have a \"false sense of security\" when it comes to the coronavirus, said Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunology at Yale University who studies why some viruses affect women more severely.\n\nGathering and analyzing data about the new virus by sex is important both for the scientists studying it and for the general public, experts said.\n\nSince the start of the outbreak, for example, public health officials have emphasized the importance of washing hands well and often, to prevent infection. But several studies have found that men -- even health care workers -- are less likely to wash their hands or to use soap than women, Dr. Klein said.\n\n\"We make these broad sweeping assumptions that men and women are the same behaviorally, in terms of comorbidities, biology and our immune system, and we just are not,\" Dr. Klein said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

"title": "'We're in a Petri Dish': How a Coronavirus Ravaged a Cruise Ship", "body": "YOKOHAMA, Japan -- The captain came over the intercom early in the evening: A passenger who had left the ship nine days earlier had tested positive for the new coronavirus sweeping through China.\n\nWhile the guests on board were unnerved, it was the final night of their two-week luxury cruise aboard the Diamond Princess. The revelry continued as the ship headed toward the port in Yokohama, Japan's second-largest city.\n\nPassengers dined on filet mignon, attended shows in the 700-seat theater and crowded the bars and dance floors into the night. Cruise directors hastily distributed a slate of activities, including Ping-Pong, karaoke and Bollywood dance lessons, to occupy guests who would have to remain on the ship another day while public health officials screened them for symptoms.\n\nHoping to soak up the final hours of their romantic voyage, Tyler and Rachel Torres, newlyweds from Irving, Tex., took in a performance by a torch singer that evening. \"We didn't really consider the danger of leaving the room,\" said Ms. Torres, 24, an occupational therapist. \"And since we were on our honeymoon, we refused to waste our last moments on the cruise.\"\n\nAs the music played on, passengers were potentially exposed to the virus. In all, it took Japanese officials more than 72 hours to impose a lockdown after they were first notified about the case connected to the ship.\n\nThe delay by the Japanese government, along with slapdash and ineffective containment measures during the two-week isolation period, would help turn the Diamond Princess into a floating epidemiological disaster.\n\nA retiree from California had a fever on the first day of the quarantine but was not tested for the virus.\n\nA day after the quarantine began, hundreds of passengers continued regular cruise activities and ate together at large buffets.\n\nDECK 17\n\nPool/ Fitness Center\n\nPool\n\nPassenger cabins\n\nPassenger cabins\n\nPassenger cabins\n\nPassenger cabins\n\nElevators\n\nPromenade Deck with lounges, bars and shops\n\nPrincess Theater\n\nElevators\n\nMedical Center\n\nDECK 4\n\nDining rooms\n\nMore than 1,000 crew members shared close quarters below deck.

Source: Princess Cruise Lines\n\nFeverish passengers were left in their rooms for days without being tested for the virus. Health officials and even some medical professionals worked on board without full protective gear. Sick crew members slept in cabins with roommates who continued their duties across the ship, undercutting the quarantine.\n\nWith 634 infections and two deaths, the cruise ship represents the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China, meriting its own category in the data compiled by the World Health Organization.\n\nNow that the quarantine has ended and most of the passengers have left, the concern is that they could start spreading the virus on shore.\n\nThe U.S. government this past week allowed 14 Americans who were infected to board evacuation flights with hundreds of passengers who weren't. Japanese officials have since let close to 1,000 passengers who tested negative walk free, even though experts fear some of them have been exposed and could later develop symptoms. Crew members were expected to start leaving this weekend.\n\nJapanese officials said they did the best they could in a fast-moving situation, as they tried to keep the virus from spreading within the country. After confirming the first cases among those on board, the authorities said, they moved to isolate passengers to reduce transmission. The government has said the quarantine was largely effective.\n\nThe ship operator, Princess Cruises, said Japanese authorities took the lead in testing and protocols. It added that the \"focus has been and remains the safety, health and well-being of our guests and crew.\"\n\nIn the early hours of Feb. 2, before the ship had even docked in Yokohama, Hong Kong officials informed the Japanese health ministry about the initial infected passenger.\n\nRecreational\n\narea\n\nNightclub\n\nBar\n\nPool and Fitness Center\n\nRecreational\n\narea\n\nPool and\n\nFitness Center\n\nBar\n\nNightclub\n\nRecreational\n\narea\n\nPool and\n\nFitness Center\n\nBar\n\nNightclub\n\nBy The New York Times\u00b7Satellite image by Maxar Technologies taken on Feb. 6.\n\nA spokeswoman for Princess Cruises said the company received \"formal verification\" of the infection from Hong Kong on Feb. 3, and announced it to passengers on the ship that evening.\n\nOnly as the parties and shows ended around 11 that night were guests advised to stick to their rooms. After the boat docked in Yokohama, medical officers boarded the ship and went door to door taking temperatures, checking for coughs and testing some passengers for the virus.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nThe cruise directors scratched the planned activities the next day, while the screening continued. People still mingled on board, lining up at large buffets for meals. They used communal ladles and tongs, and shared salt and pepper shakers on tables.\n\nPromenade deck with\n\nlounges, bars and shops\n\nPromenade deck with\n\nlounges, bars and shops\n\nPassengers figured their departure would be delayed by only a day or so. Many were walking up to breakfast when the captain came over the intercom again on the morning of Feb. 5.\n\nThe Japanese health ministry had now confirmed 10 cases of the coronavirus on the ship, he told them.\n\nGuests needed to return to their rooms immediately, where they would have to stay, isolated, for the next 14 days.\n\nTainted Memories\n\nTrapped in their cabins, the 2,666 passengers now had time to recall every encounter that might have exposed them to the virus in the days before the ship's lockdown.\n\nDECK 14\n\nPassenger cabins\n\nDECK 14\n\nPassenger cabins\n\nThere was the buffet on Deck 14, where guests were urged to wash their hands before joining the line, though hygiene habits varied widely, some passengers recalled. Now they wondered why the buffet had remained open even after the ship's officers learned about the infected guest.\n\nMemories of art auctions, afternoon high teas, quiz nights and mahjong games all took on a sinister hue.\n\n\"Everything looks tainted in retrospect,\" said Sarah Arana, 52, a medical social worker from Paso Robles, Calif., who left on an American evacuation flight.\n\nA Princess spokeswoman said that the crew had carried out \"routine environmental cleaning and sanitizing\" using disinfectant that is \"known to quickly kill coronaviruses in 30 seconds.\"\n\nPassengers worried about their excursions on shore. The infected passenger had taken a bus tour in Kagoshima, a city in southern Japan.\n\nGay Courter, 75, an American novelist from Crystal River, Fla., who once set a murder mystery on a cruise, dwelled on the ship's last stop, in Naha, the capital of Okinawa. As people disembarked, public health officials took their temperatures -- a measure that was becoming more commonplace as the virus spiraled in China.\n\nLooking back, Ms. Courter wondered if the coronavirus had already started to spread. With her husband, Philip, and a group of friends, she ate noodles and fried sweet potatoes at an outdoor stall.\n\n\"In my heart, I regret doing that,\" she said, \"because it was such a crowded place and there were people from the ship crawling around the town.\"\n\nEach day, more cases emerged: 10, another 10, then a spike of 41.\n\nWhat distressed passengers most was a sense that information was being withheld. Hours would pass between when the health ministry leaked new cases to the media and the people on board were notified.\n\nPassengers took to counting ambulances lined up on the pier to guess how many new infections would be announced that day. Japanese guests hung banners off balconies, with one reading, \"Serious lack of medicine, lack of information.\"\n\n'No road maps'\n\nPolicies and protocols shifted as the quarantine wore on.\n\nOn the second day, health officials began letting those in windowless cabins out for fresh air breaks. It wasn't until the next day that passengers were warned to keep more than six feet away from anyone else. Mr. Torres, a nurse who has since evacuated with his wife, noticed that others were not always vigilant about wearing masks on deck.\n\nOn the fifth day, passengers were issued heavy-duty N95 masks and advised to wear them when they opened their doors to accept deliveries of meals and amenities from the crew.\n\nHalfway into the quarantine, the Japanese government announced that some people would be eligible to continue their confinement onshore -- those 80 or older with underlying medical conditions or windowless cabins.\n\nThe changes didn't inspire confidence. Passengers were waiting days for prescriptions to be filled for chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. People were running out of toothpaste and clean underwear.\n\nTadashi Chida, a passenger in his 70s, sent a handwritten letter to Japan's health ministry complaining that the crew seemed overwhelmed and that quarantine officers were not attending to those with symptoms.\n\n\"The ship is out of control,\" Mr. Chida said, adding that his wife had waited nearly a week for medication.\n\n\"An outbreak is happening,\" he said. \"We have no road maps.\"\n\nYoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said this past week that the country's authorities had \"made the maximum consideration to secure the health of passengers and crew.\"\n\nAt first, health officials didn't test everyone, saying they lacked the resources. Instead, they focused on high-risk individuals: those who had direct contact with the infected passenger, and later older and symptomatic people.\n\nSome passengers had trouble getting medical attention, even when they started to show possible symptoms. On the first full day of the quarantine, Carol Montgomery, 67, a retired administrative assistant from San Clemente, Calif., called the infirmary, saying she had a fever and wanted to be tested.\n\nShe was told that it was up to the Japanese health ministry, and that no tests were available on board. After a day passed, her husband, John, called the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and tried to convince an official that everybody needed to be tested.\n\n\"We're in a petri dish,\" Mr. Montgomery said. \"It's an experiment. We're their guinea pigs.\"\n\nMs. Montgomery eventually persuaded the ship's medical office to let the couple leave their cabin for an exam. A doctor gave them flu tests, which came back negative. The doctor prescribed an antibiotic for Ms. Montgomery's urinary tract infection.\n\nThey still did not get tested for the coronavirus. The couple later evacuated with the Americans.\n\nJohn Haering, a retired railway operations manager from Tooele, Utah, called the medical office when his temperature rose sharply. He was told that if it wasn't an emergency, he would have to wait.\n\nAt one point, someone came to the door with a clipboard, he said, asked for his temperature and left. Inside the cabin he shared with his wife, Mr. Haering, 63, sweated it out, taking cold showers and swallowing the last of their Tylenol supply as his temperature climbed to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFour days later, after his fever had broken, officials in hazmat suits showed up at the couple's door, ordered Mr. Haering to pack a bag, and loaded him into an ambulance, leaving his wife on the ship.\n\nThe next day, a doctor at a hospital about 40 miles from the port told him he had tested positive for the virus. He remains in the hospital, while his wife, Melanie, is now in quarantine on a U.S. military base.\n\nShared bathrooms and buffets\n\nThrough it all, crew members were working overtime, sometimes as long as 13-hour shifts. They prepared and delivered meals three times a day to 1,500 staterooms. They dropped off towels, bedsheets and extra treats for guests: Sudoku puzzles, origami papers, beauty masks and, on Valentine's Day, chocolates.\n\nThe crew members, who numbered 1,045, had to remain on the job even as they faced the greatest risk of infection. All told, 85 crew members have tested positive for the virus.\n\nBelow deck, they shared close quarters, with as many as four to a bathroom. They ate their own meals buffet-style.\n\nMost crew members stayed on decks 2 and 3.\n\nMost crew members stayed on decks 2 and 3.\n\nThey manned phone lines as frantic guests called looking for answers to endless questions. They swabbed the decks and guardrails after each fresh air break for passengers. They did guests' laundry. For certain tasks, they did not wear gloves, and they reused face masks for more than the recommended day.\n\nThere were also new duties: guarding the hallways at night to ensure that passengers didn't leave their rooms. When infected passengers were sent to hospitals, crew members had to carry their luggage.\n\n\"The emotional, psychological and physical stress that we are going through now is really hard,\" said a woman who worked in the kitchens, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing her job. She has since tested positive for the virus.\n\nEven after some crew members came down with a fever, they continued to share rooms with other workers. \"My cabin mate is staying with me,\" said one person on the housekeeping staff who was consigned to his room when he developed a fever. \"But he is working.\"\n\n\"What's the point of isolation?\" he asked. \"We are stuck in a box which is already contaminated.\"\n\nThe virus has also ravaged public health officials who knew they were walking onto a contaminated ship. Hundreds of these officials, many of them bureaucrats with little experience in managing infectious diseases, helped with screenings and administrative tasks. Some did not wear full protective gear, and six contracted the virus.\n\nHealth ministry officials reluctantly allowed Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist, onto the ship late in the quarantine. Dr. Iwata was alarmed by the lack of control measures, even among the medical staff. In videos he posted on YouTube, he said he had observed a nurse at the ship's medical center receiving ill crew members without wearing a mask.\n\n\"She said she was already infected, and so she was completely giving up,\" he said in the videos. He took down his YouTube posts after coming under criticism for violating the chain of command on the ship.\n\nPlastic sheeting and tape\n\nTo pass the time in captivity, passengers spent long hours streaming movies or posting on social media. They did calisthenics and watched the onboard magician perform tricks on closed-circuit television.\n\nAs the infections continued to mount, boredom turned to fear. On private Facebook groups, passengers said they were desperate to leave, with their families using the hashtag #getthemoffthatboat. They questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine, fretting that the virus could pass between rooms through the ventilation system.\n\nAfter American passengers raised concerns with the embassy, an official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wrote that there was \"no current evidence to suggest that the virus spreads between rooms on a ship through the air-handling system.\" The best course, the official said, was for passengers to wait out the quarantine in their rooms.\n\nA week and a half later, American officials reversed their position. The U.S. government announced that it was evacuating them before the end of the quarantine and would confine them for an additional 14 days on bases in California and Texas. A letter to American passengers said that \"the Department of Health and Human Services made an assessment that passengers and crew members onboard are at high risk of exposure.\"\n\nThe evacuation turned problematic. While the 328 passengers and crew members were on their way to the airport in Tokyo, American officials learned from Japanese health authorities that 14 of them had tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThey waited for hours on the tarmac as C.D.C. experts debated with officials from the State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services about what to do. It took so long that some passengers had to get off and urinate against the side of the buses.\n\nOfficials from the State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services ultimately decided to take them all. They put the infected at the back, separating them on two planes with only 10-foot plastic sheeting and tape.\n\nAs the passengers boarded, Ms. Courter was standing next to a woman as she was being told she had tested positive. \"We were less than three feet away,\" Ms. Courter said. \"And I remember thinking: 'I just spent two weeks to avoid anyone who is positive, and now here is one breathing right in front of me.'\"\n\nOther countries followed the lead of the United States in organizing charter flights for their citizens and new 14-day quarantines. Still, that left many to just walk off the ship at the end of the quarantine in Yokohama, including a large number of Japanese passengers, who made up half of those on board.\n\nThe night of Feb. 18, the health ministry began clearing passengers to leave, giving each a certificate saying they had tested negative for the coronavirus and posed \"no risk of infection.\" Nearly 1,000 walked free over the next three days, some boarding city buses, others climbing into taxis.\n\nExperts have questioned whether those passengers truly pose no risk to the general public. Some could develop symptoms later after having tested negative.\n\nOn Thursday, Linda Tsukamoto, 63, a retired retail manager from Marina del Rey, Calif., who decided not to take one of the American flights, was released from the ship. She will not be allowed back into the United States for at least another two weeks, so she checked into a hotel in Tokyo.\n\nShe said that hotel staff members were wearing masks, and that there were signs warning guests of the risk of the coronavirus.\n\n\"I will stay in most of the time,\" she said, \"to stay safe after this long journey.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Eimi Yamamitsu, Makiko

"Senator Tom Cotton Repeats Fringe Theory of Coronavirus Origins", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, has repeated an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that has spread from small-town China to the right-wing news media in the United States: The new coronavirus originated in a high-security biochemical lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the outbreak's center.\n\nIn a television interview on Fox News on Sunday, Mr. Cotton suggested that a dearth of information about the origins of the virus, which causes the disease COVID-19, raised more questions than answers.\n\n\"We don't know where it originated, and we have to get to the bottom of that,\" Mr. Cotton said on the program Sunday Morning Futures. He then raised the possibility that the virus originated in a \"biosafety level-4 super laboratory.\" Such laboratories are used for research into potentially deadly infectious diseases.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\n\"Now, we don't have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China's duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all,\" he added.\n\nThe Chinese authorities say the outbreak began in a market in Wuhan where wild animals were sold. The city is also home to a biochemical laboratory.\n\nAfter receiving criticism for lending credence to what has been largely considered a fringe theory, the senator took to Twitter to say he did not necessarily think the virus was an \"engineered bioweapon.\"\n\nThat idea, he said, was just one of several hypotheses that included the possibility that the outbreak was a \"deliberate release.\"\n\nHe also said it was possible that the virus spread naturally, \"but almost certainly not from the Wuhan food market.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Furious That Cruise Ship Passengers With Coronavirus Were Brought Back to U.S.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Trump was infuriated that 14 American citizens who had tested positive for coronavirus were permitted to return this week to the United States, said two senior administration officials. The decision took the president, a self-declared \"germophobe,\" by surprise.\n\nOfficials at the State Department decided to bring back the citizens, who had been quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, after consulting with a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services. But officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention objected, concerned that the passengers, among hundreds of Americans on the ship, could spread the virus. News organizations reported on the decision on Monday, and the passengers arrived in the United States that day.\n\nMr. Trump, furious at not having been briefed on the Americans who had tested positive, relayed his anger to Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, and other top officials. They then alerted the White House interagency task force on the coronavirus, which Mr. Azar oversees. One official said Mr. Trump views shutting the borders to infected people as critical to keeping the country safe and wants to be seen as managing a proper response.\n\nThe top State Department official on the task force is Stephen E. Biegun, the deputy secretary of state.\n\nDuring the early legs of a four-day trip to the West Coast meant to bolster his re-election effort, Mr. Trump paid close attention to Fox News's coverage of the Diamond Princess that played aboard Air Force One.\n\nWord of Mr. Trump's anger had already begun circulating among officials on Tuesday morning. The Washington Post first reported on it on Friday.\n\nIn 2014, during an Ebola crisis in Africa, Mr. Trump, who was then a private citizen, angrily demanded that the Obama administration cancel flights and bar anyone infected with the virus from entering the country -- including American medical workers who had gone to Africa to help. \"KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!\" he wrote in a July 31 tweet after learning that one American medical worker would be evacuated to Atlanta from Liberia.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak How Is the U.S. Being Affected?\n\nUpdated Feb. 22, 2020\n\nA look at how local health departments are struggling to monitor thousands of people returning to the U.S. from China. At least 34 cases have been confirmed in the U.S. and more infections are expected. A woman returning from Wuhan, China, gave us a look at life inside a coronavirus quarantine center in the U.S. An Omaha hospital that drew attention for treating Ebola patients is now playing a key role again. A couple tested positive after returning from vacation in Hawaii. One of the people evacuated from Wuhan last week to San Diego had coronavirus but was discharged because of a labeling error. The outbreak has left some Asian-Americans feeling an unsettling level of public scrutiny. Some evacuees are wondering why they aren't being tested on bases. Pittsburgh, Wuhan's \"sister city,\" has been shaken by the outbreak and is sending aid to relatives and friends trapped in the center of a deadly outbreak. There was a race to contain the disease after one man's cough became confirmation of America's first case. Many who recently traveled to China are isolating themselves in 'self quarantines' for 14 days. Most experts agree: To protect yourself wash your hands and avoid touching your face. Tips to not get sick while traveling. Affected by travel? Or do you know someone who is? Please contact us at coronavirus@nytimes.com if you are willing to be contacted by a reporter or have your comments used for a coming story.\n\n\"The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter the next day, adding: \"People that go to far away places to help out are great -- but must suffer the consequences!\"\n\nThere have been at least 634 infections and two deaths from the Diamond Princess, which Japanese officials kept in isolation for two weeks at a port in Yokohama. That effort at a quarantine contributed to the virus's rapid spread among passengers. The cluster from the ship is the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China, warranting its own category in data compiled by the World Health Organization.\n\nAmerican officials began a complex evacuation procedure for 328 passengers aboard the Diamond Princess on Sunday night. All had been examined by American medical experts and showed no symptoms of the coronavirus, Dr. William Walters, managing director of operational medicine at the State Department, and Dr. Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, said on Monday during a conference call with reporters.\n\nBut as those passengers were bused to Haneda Airport in Tokyo early Monday morning, Japanese officials told American counterparts that laboratory tests for 14 passengers had come back positive, Dr. Walters said. The tests had been conducted two to three days earlier, but American officials, believing the timing of the results would be \"unpredictable\" because of the volume of testing being done in Japan, began the evacuation without having all results in hand.\n\nAmerican passengers who had already tested positive or who had displayed symptoms had been sent to hospitals in Japan, Dr. Walters said.\n\nAfter they learned that 14 passengers had tested positive, American officials decided that the entire group set to leave Japan should be treated according to protocols the officials had developed for evacuees, Dr. Walters said. That meant continuing to transport those who had tested positive but putting them in isolation -- behind sheets of plastic about 10-feet tall -- at the rear of the two planes flying them back to the United States.\n\nDr. Walters said on Monday that he and Dr. Kadlec reviewed the possible options after learning of the test results.\n\n\"Then the question was simply this: Are these evacuees?\" Dr. Walters said. \"And do we follow our protocol? And the answer to that was yes on both accounts.\"\n\nDr. Kadlec added, \"We had additional expertise and experienced eyes on these people and monitoring through the flight.\"\n\nThe planes landed at Travis Air Force Base in California and Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Most of the 14 passengers who had tested positive were then flown to Omaha for treatment and monitoring by experts at the University of Nebraska.\n\nSince then, Japanese officials have informed American officials that several other passengers among the 328 brought back had also tested positive for coronavirus. On Friday, American officials said at least 34 people inside the United States have the virus -- 18 of them from the Diamond Princess. All of the 34 cases have been linked to overseas travel. There has been no sign yet of the virus spreading among communities in the United States.\n\nThe State Department is closely monitoring American citizens on board the Westerdam cruise ship in Cambodia, as well as Americans who have disembarked and are in hotels in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. Those Americans are expected to travel onward at some point. One 83-year-old American woman from the ship traveled to Malaysia and tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nDr. Williams said Monday that 92 American citizens were still on board the Westerdam, while another 260 were in hotels in the Cambodian capital. About 300 American citizens had left the country, but \"only after testing by the government of Cambodia's ministry of health,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked whether the United States was thinking about arranging evacuation flights for the hundreds of Americans in Cambodia or elsewhere, Dr. Walters did not offer a direct answer. He said the State Department was \"following very closely\" the situation of American citizens in places where coronavirus is prevalent and of citizens who are \"having difficulty in returning to the United States because of the disruptions in the international airline industry, and flights, and so forth.\"\n\nSeparately, State Department officials say that thousands of Russia-linked social media accounts are spreading disinformation about the coronavirus, including a conspiracy theory that the United States is behind the outbreak.\n\nAmerican monitors first identified the campaign in mid-January. Agence France-Presse reported the assessment on Saturday.\n\n\"Russia's intent is to sow discord and undermine U.S. institutions and alliances from within, including through covert and coercive malign influence campaigns,\" said Philip T. Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia. \"By spreading disinformation about coronavirus, Russian malign actors are once again choosing to threaten public safety by distracting from the global health response.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edward_wong@nytimes.com", "name": "Edward

Among those, 39 of the new cases were connected to a church called Shincheonji.\n\nOfficials said a 61-year-old woman who had attended services at the church over the past two Sundays had been identified as a potential source of the spread of the virus.\n\nThe new figures give South Korea the world's second largest number of confirmed cases if those from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are not included in Japan's total. The vast majority of cases are in mainland China, which has reported more than 75,000 cases. Japan has 94 cases, which does not include the more than 600 people who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\n\nSouth Korea reported on Thursday what officials said could be its first death from the coronavirus. A 63-year-old patient with symptoms of pneumonia died on Wednesday at the Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo.\n\nChina's deaths and infections rise after officials change their methodology again.\n\nChinese officials announced on Friday that 889 new cases of the coronavirus had been reported in the previous 24 hours, raising the overall total above 75,000.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nThe death toll went up by 118, to 2,236.\n\nAll but three of the new deaths were in China's central Hubei Province, the focus of the outbreak. Hubei was also the source of nearly three quarters of the new confirmed cases of infection.\n\nThe new count came one day after Chinese health authorities said they were using new criteria to count cases of the coronavirus. The move appeared to undo a change they made last week.\n\nThat earlier change allowed health officials in Hubei to count cases diagnosed in clinical settings, including with the use of CT scans showing lung infections, not just those confirmed using specialized kits to test for the virus.\n\nOn Thursday, officials said Hubei would now resume using the same criteria as the rest of the country. Cases will be considered confirmed only if the virus is found.\n\nTrials for two coronavirus drug therapies to begin.\n\nThe World Health Organization said on Thursday that two new drug therapy trials to help fight the coronavirus are set to begin in China and that early results may be available within three weeks.\n\nOne trial involves an experimental antiviral drug made by Gilead. It has not yet been licensed for use.\n\nThe drug was tested against the Ebola virus in Congo, where it was not very effective. But when it was given to the first American known to be infected with the coronavirus, an unidentified man in Washington State, he recovered.\n\nThe second trial involves a combination of two anti-H.I.V. drugs that is sold as Kaletra in the United States and available in generic versions.\n\nIf either therapy helps prevent severe pneumonia, sepsis or organ failure in coronavirus patients, death rates may fall. Two other drugs -- favipiravir and chloroquine -- have also been discussed as potential treatments.\n\nTo protect their family, doctors turn to self-imposed isolation.\n\nEunice Chan, a physician in Hong Kong, removes her face mask only to shower, eat and drink. When her three daughters, ages 7, 9 and 12, gather around the dining table to eat, she takes her meal in another room.\n\n\"There's no more hugging, no more kissing,\" she said. \"This is especially difficult for my youngest daughter.\"\n\nHer self-imposed isolation is understandable. In Hong Kong, there have been two deaths and 68 confirmed cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. And the city shares a porous border with the mainland, where more than 100 people on average have died of the disease every day since Feb. 1.\n\nThe risks, and anxieties, in the Chan household are particularly high. Both Dr. Chan, 44, and her husband, Dr. Pierre Chan, 43, have taken extraordinary measures to treat their patients and protect their family.\n\nDr. Pierre Chan, a gastroenterologist at a public hospital and a member of Hong Kong's legislature, this month examined five patients infected with the coronavirus.\n\nThough he was wearing full protective gear and his hospital did not require him to go into quarantine, he slept on the floor of his office for 14 days to avoid the possibility of infecting his daughters and his in-laws.\n\n\"I don't dare go home,\" he said. \"I don't even dare to go into hotels. You never know: I could be asymptomatic. Maybe a tiny bit of the virus got onto my clothes.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Donald G.

The Chinese authorities announced hundreds of new coronavirus cases in Chinese prisons on Friday, underscoring the fast-spreading and unpredictable nature of the virus, which has popped up in far-flung areas with little known connection to the outbreak's epicenter.\n\nAt least 500 prisoners and guards, in at least four different prisons across three provinces, had been infected with the virus, officials announced on Friday. More than 200 have been detected in one prison in the city of Jining, 450 miles east of Wuhan, the city at the center of the epidemic. Officials suggested that the Jining outbreak may have been tied to a coughing prison guard who turned out to be infected.\n\nThe new cases, confirmed in the previous 24 hours, raised the overall total of infections in China above 75,000. The death toll in the country rose by 118, to 2,236.\n\nThe new clusters showed, once again, the difficulty in judging the scale of China's epidemic, amid concerns about underreporting and rapidly shifting definitions of confirmed cases. Before the prisoners' infections were announced, Hubei Province, where the outbreak began, had already released a count of new infections in the previous 24 hours.\n\nLater on Friday, officials there said they had revised the count, because they had received a handwritten tally of infected prisoners late on Thursday night. The prison system was not connected to the rest of the province's disease reporting system, they said, renewing questions about the counting of cases and prompting a rare official acknowledgment that constantly changing tallies had sown confusion and mistrust.\n\n\"The adjustment of these data has aroused great attention from the society and cast doubt on the numbers,\" Tu Yuanchao, deputy director of the Hubei Provincial Health and Health Commission, said at a news conference on Friday, referring to both the addition of the prisoners' cases and recent adjustments to how Hubei defines a confirmed case.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nThe infected prisoners were among several surging counts on Friday. The number of cases in South Korea continued to soar, as officials there confirmed 100 new cases and the country's second death. The new figures brought that country's total number of infections to 204, the world's largest number of cases outside of China and Japan.\n\nEighty-seven of the 100 new cases in South Korea were connected to a church in the southeastern part of the country. Officials said a 61-year-old woman who tested positive earlier this week, and who had attended services at the church, may have spread the virus there.\n\nInfections in prisons may be especially concerning because of the risks of rapid transmission among people in close quarters.\n\nThere might be limited space available to isolate patients, who would likely be crowded indoors, in high density situations, said Dr. Benjamin Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong. \"It's a really difficult situation to prevent transmission from occurring,\" he said.\n\nIn a sign of the risks posed by the clusters in prisons, nearly a dozen officials were dismissed on Friday in relation to the outbreaks, according to state media reports. Among them were the party secretary of the provincial justice department in Shandong Province, home to Jining, and a warden and party secretary at a prison in Zhejiang.\n\nAlso on Friday, the Communist Party's Central Committee, a group of about 370 senior officials, sent an investigative team to Shandong Province, to probe the prison outbreak there, according to People's Daily, the party's main newspaper.\n\nThe authorities in Shandong said in a statement that they would \"quickly set up a hospital\" on prison grounds to treat those infected.\n\nStill, some expressed skepticism about the quality of prisoners' care.\n\n\"Prisoners are routinely denied of access to adequate medical care even during normal times,\" Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said. \"Now with medical resources stretched to the limit in many areas in China, it is hard to imagine prisoners' medical needs would be a priority of the government.\"\n\nNursing homes have also emerged as potential transmission hotspots, prompting concern given the virus's documented toll on the elderly.\n\nIn the city of Qiqihar, near the Chinese border with Russia, a district party secretary was removed from his post because he had not done enough to prevent the epidemic, according to an official notice on Feb. 15. Of 10 confirmed cases in the district he oversaw, the notice said, one occurred in a nursing home.\n\nIn Zhejiang, an official said recently that the province had been the first in the nation to seal off nursing homes, barring all except some essential staff from entering.\n\n\"Everyone knows that the elderly are the key group for epidemic prevention and control, and nursing homes are a place where the elderly live in high concentration,\" the official, Li Jie, said.\n\nThe virus is also spreading even in places that might be expected to have the closest monitoring and prevention. In Beijing, a spike in cases at two hospitals raised fears that the epidemic could be growing in a city so far largely spared from extensive infections.\n\nAn outbreak in this city would have great symbolic resonance, especially as the central authorities have urged workers to restart the economy, and China's leader, Xi Jinping, recently touted \"visible progress\" in fighting the epidemic.\n\nIn Beijing's Fuxing Hospital, on the city's western side, at least 36 people are infected. They include eight medical workers, nine janitorial workers and 19 patients or their relatives.\n\nThe new figures reflected a large jump since Feb. 3, when city officials first announced that five medical workers had tested positive for the virus.\n\nAnother medical center, Peking University People's Hospital, also recorded its first three cases: a woman who had previously been hospitalized and her daughter and son-in-law who had visited her after traveling to Xinjiang, the western region.\n\nBeijing, compared to other provinces and provincial-level cities, has had comparatively few cases: 396 as of Thursday and only 4 deaths.\n\nDr. Cowling, in Hong Kong, said that though medical staff treating confirmed patients might be highly vigilant and well protected, infection could still occur in other wards of a medical center, if staff members there did not know they were treating someone with exposure to the virus.\n\nThe infection -- and in some cases, deaths -- of medical workers has for many Chinese become a potent symbol of the epidemic's toll. On Thursday, another doctor in Wuhan died. The doctor, Peng Yinhua, was just 29 years old and had postponed his wedding to continue treating patients, according to a statement from the hospital he worked and local media reports.\n\nEarlier this week, another high-profile doctor, Liu Zhiming, died. Dr. Liu was the director of the Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan.\n\nChoe Sang-Hun contributed reporting.

Hurt Revenue", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Apple said on Monday that it was cutting its sales expectations because of the coronavirus in China, in a sign that the outbreak has hit global business and is set to exact a steep toll.\n\nThe iPhone maker, which is highly dependent on Chinese factories and Chinese consumers, said in a statement that its supply of smartphones would be hurt because production was ramping up more slowly than expected as China reopened its factories. Apple also said that demand for its gadgets in China had been hurt by the outbreak; it closed all of its stores in the country last month and they have yet to reopen.\n\n\"Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,\" said Apple, one of the world's most valuable public companies.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nApple is one of the first to publicly disclose what is likely to be a difficult chain effect from China and the virus on the business world. Many global companies rely on factories in China to manufacture everything from socks to laptop computers. And Chinese consumers, who had ridden a wave of rising wealth, had snapped up luxury goods, iPhones and many other items.\n\nFears over the coronavirus's impact on the global economy have been growing. The Japanese economy -- the third largest after the United States and China -- slipped 6.3 percent in the last quarter of 2019, before the outbreak, and may fall into recession since Japan relies on a lucrative flow of Chinese tourists and exports to that country's enormous market of consumers.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has also hobbled one of Germany's most important customers and suppliers. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles temporarily shut a factory in Serbia because of shortages of Chinese parts. The shutdown, apparently the first by a carmaker in Europe, added to concerns that the coronavirus could sap what little growth the Continent has been able to muster recently.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Operatives of the Communist State", "body": "WASHINGTON -- For years they have operated as news organizations in the United States, deploying scores of journalists to cover the major events of the day and to report back to their readers and viewers at home, even if the most important of those was the leadership of the Communist Party of China.\n\nNow, the Trump administration has declared them not practitioners of journalism, but rather operatives of the Chinese state.\n\nThe State Department informed China on Tuesday that its five foremost news agencies -- Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily and The People's Daily -- will now officially be treated as foreign government functionaries, subject to the same rules as diplomats stationed in the United States. The new action was described Tuesday afternoon by a senior State Department official.\n\nThe decision -- debated in Washington for years but never carried out, in part because of concerns over restricting the freedom of the press -- comes at a time when the administration has moved aggressively on multiple fronts to fight what officials describe as extensive Chinese influence and intelligence operations in the United States.\n\nIn the last month alone, prosecutors have brought cases against Chinese intelligence operations involving scientific research at Harvard and the 2017 hack of Equifax, one of the nation's largest credit reporting agencies. They also charged Huawei, the telecommunications company, and two of its subsidiaries with federal racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\nThe legal assault on Chinese entities has unfolded even as bilateral tensions have flared over China's handling of the coronavirus epidemic, which prompted the evacuation of American diplomats and other citizens from Wuhan, the city in central China at the source of the outbreak. It is part of a concerted effort to put new pressure on China's government barely a month after President Trump signed a temporary truce in the trade war he started.\n\nChina's critics in Washington, some of whom have long called for action against the country's state media, hailed the decision.\n\nAt the same time, the decision could lead to retaliation against American journalists who work in China, especially those affiliated with the United States government, like Voice of America.\n\n\"China has long masked intelligence operations with journalistic credentials,\" said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, echoing a suspicion held in national security circles.\n\n\"The danger is China could reciprocate against our journalists,\" he said. \"The difference is our journalists in China are actually journalists.\"\n\nThe immediate impact of the designation remained unclear.\n\nOne administration official said the designation would not immediately interfere with the work of the organizations or their employees. It would, however, require China to register all of them with the State Department, as they now must do with diplomats in the Chinese Embassy in Washington or in consulates around the country.\n\nThe official said that news organizations were included because they were \"substantially owned and effectively controlled\" by China's government.\n\nThe American government has already targeted some of the news agencies under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires anyone lobbying on behalf of foreign governments to submit regular reports on their activities to the Justice Department.\n\nPartly in response to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, the administration has forced parts of China's official propaganda apparatus to register. They included CGTN, the English-language channel of China Central Television, Beijing's main domestic network, which was forced to register beginning last year. One of the others, China Daily, has been registered as a foreign agent since 1983.\n\nThe new action goes further, treating the news organizations as part of China's diplomatic missions whose activities are regulated under the Foreign Missions Act. Enacted in 1982, the law is a legal tool intended to ensure equitable treatment for American diplomats serving in countries around the world, often under onerous government restrictions. It deals with everything from providing visas to acquiring property to extending diplomatic immunity in matters of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nLast fall, for example, the State Department began requiring Chinese diplomats to give notice before they plan to have any meetings with local or state officials and with educational and research institutions. That move came in retaliation for similar Chinese government rules imposed on American diplomats. With the latest change, the department would have the power to impose similar restrictions on Chinese journalists.\n\nAmerican officials have become much more suspicious of the activities of Chinese diplomats and have increased scrutiny of their travels and meetings. In September, the State Department secretly expelled two Chinese Embassy officials in Washington after they were caught driving on a sensitive military base in Virginia with their wives. The expulsions appear to be the first of Chinese diplomats suspected of espionage in more than 30 years.\n\nIt was not clear why the administration decided to act now on the Chinese news organizations, although the administration official said the move reflected long-simmering frustration over the forbearance shown to Chinese official media in the United States, despite evidence that the organizations serve as a front for intelligence agencies.\n\nThe U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressionally mandated agency, warned in its report in 2017 that \"Chinese intelligence-gathering and information-warfare efforts are known to involve staff of Chinese state-run media organizations.\"\n\nIn recent years, a growing number of American officials have discussed imposing strict visa reciprocity on Chinese news organizations after Beijing increasingly began limiting visas and residence permits issued to foreign journalists and curtailed the lengths of those documents.\n\nUnlike Russia's information campaigns in the United States, which have been artfully tailored to sow distrust in the American government and the democratic system, China's media efforts in the United States have tended to reflect more traditional forms of government propaganda. Reports on CGTN or in China Daily, for example, are more likely to extol the country's economic and diplomatic achievements than to denigrate American democracy.\n\nXinhua, which is China's main news agency and serves as a channel for most major announcements, maintains bureaus around the world, with its largest in Washington and New York. It is common practice for many of them to produce internal documents, intended for consumption not by the public but by high-ranking officials.\n\nSome disagreed with the action. \"I don't see any evidence that they are doing anything nefarious that would warrant this response,\" said Maria Repnikova, an assistant professor at Georgia State University and the author of \"Media Politics in China: Improvising Power Under Authoritarianism.\"\n\nChina Daily, the English-language version of one of the main state newspapers, regularly publishes advertising supplements in newspapers around the country, including The New York Times. They generally offer an informative, if anodyne, view of world affairs refracted through the lens of the Communist Party.\n\n\"The China Daily advertisement insert is clearly labeled and meets our advertising acceptability standards,\" said Ari Isaacman Bevacqua, a Times spokeswoman. \"The New York Times covers China thoroughly and aggressively, and at no time has advertising influenced our coverage.\"\n\nHowever, some experts on China say China Daily pushes insidious propaganda onto foreign readers, especially in its attempts to whitewash vast human rights abuses against Uighurs, Tibetans and other ethnic minorities.\n\nSophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch, has repeatedly denounced China Daily. The paper, she said on Twitter last year, was \"nothing more than a mouthpiece for a government that conflates peaceful criticism with terrorism, crushes peaceful protests, and arbitrarily detains shocking numbers of #Uyghurs and other #Muslims.\"\n\nOne issue in particular drew the attention of the White House in 2018. An advertisement placed in The Des Moines Register highlighted the benefits of free trade for Iowa's farmers at a time Mr. Trump was excoriating what he called China's unfair trade practices.\n\nMr. Trump, in typical fashion, responded on Twitter.\n\nLara Jakes reported from Washington and Steven Lee Myers from Beijing.

need to know:China again alters the methodology for counting coronavirus cases, as death toll rises to 2,118.Japan records deaths of two passengers who had been aboard a quarantined cruise ship.The first coronavirus patient in the United States has recovered.U.S.-China relations were already fraying. The outbreak has damaged them further.China again alters the methodology for counting coronavirus cases, as death toll rises to 2,118.\n\nFor the second time in a week, China on Thursday changed its criteria for confirming coronavirus cases, throwing into confusion the methodology that the country at the heart of the outbreak uses to track transmissions and resulting in a dramatic decrease in new infections.\n\nThe new criteria exclude patients from Hubei Province, the hardest-hit area of the outbreak, who are diagnosed using clinical methods, including CT scans and an assessment of symptoms. Instead, patients there would be counted as having contracted the virus only when confirmed by a specialized nucleic acid test.\n\nUsing the new criteria, officials in the province on Thursday recorded 349 new cases in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total national figures to 74,576. New deaths rose by 114 on Wednesday, bringing the death toll to 2,118.\n\nIn its sixth iteration of a diagnosis regime, the government said it would differentiate between \"suspected\" and \"confirmed\" cases from now on. Cases would only be considered confirmed after genetic testing.\n\nSuch tests are notoriously difficult to conduct and the results are often wrong. It takes at least two days to process the results of the test.\n\nThe change has caused confusion among public health experts, who said it is now extra difficult to track the outbreak in China.\n\n\"For an epidemiologist, it's really frustrating when case definitions keep on changing,\" said Benjamin Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong. \"Why can't they work out what's a probable, suspected and confirmed case? It's totally confusing.\"\n\nLast week, the government switched to counting cases based on diagnoses made in clinical settings, including scanning patients' lungs, in an effort to more quickly isolate and treat patients.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nAs a result, however, the country may have overcounted cases because lung scans are an imperfect means to diagnose patients. Even patients with ordinary seasonal flu may develop pneumonia visible on a lung scan.\n\nJapan records deaths of two passengers who had been aboard a quarantined cruise ship.\n\nTwo passengers from the cruise ship quarantined in Japan have died after contracting the new coronavirus, the first deaths among the more than 600 people on board who have been infected, a Japanese health ministry official said on Thursday.\n\nThe two people, both Japanese, were an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman, the Japanese broadcaster NHK reported. They were taken to hospitals on Feb. 11 and 12, and both had underlying health issues, the broadcaster said. No other information about them was immediately available.\n\nHundreds of passengers have begun disembarking from the ship, the Diamond Princess, after Japan declared the two-week quarantine over, even as cases of the virus on the vessel have continued to rise.\n\nThe authorities have said they are releasing only people who have tested negative for the virus and are showing no symptoms. But experts on infectious diseases have pointed to deficiencies in the quarantine protocols on the ship and questioned the decision to let them go free.\n\nThe first coronavirus patient in the United States has recovered.\n\nA 35-year-old man from Washington State who last month became the first confirmed coronavirus patient in the United States has made a full recovery, health officials in Snohomish County, Wash., said on Wednesday.\n\nSince his discharge from the hospital about three weeks ago, the man has remained at home and in isolation at the request of local health officials. He was supplied with groceries, and on Valentine's Day was given a cupcake.\n\nBut after consulting with state and federal officials, the Snohomish Health District concluded that it was safe to release him from all restrictions.\n\n\"He is now considered fully recovered and free to go about his regular activities,\" Snohomish officials said in a statement. \"We cannot thank him enough for his patience and cooperation throughout the entire process.\"\n\nThe man tested positive for the virus after returning to his home in Snohomish County, Wash., after visiting family in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. He was admitted to an isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center, where his condition worsened before improving.\n\nNine days after his symptoms started, an X-ray revealed pneumonia, according to a description of his case published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He received an experimental antiviral drug called remdesivir on a compassionate basis, which the Food and Drug Administration allows for drugs not yet federally approved.\n\nU.S.-China relations were already fraying. The outbreak has damaged them further.\n\nThe coronavirus epidemic has become the latest and potentially most divisive issue driving apart the United States and China. For the fiercest critics of China within the Trump administration, panic over the coronavirus has provided a new opening to denounce the rule of the Communist Party, which they say cannot be trusted.\n\nBut the hard-liners' message has been undermined at times by President Trump, who has publicly commended President Xi Jinping's handling of the crisis and even called for greater commercial ties, including the sale of jet engines to China.\n\n\"Look,'' Mr. Trump said on Tuesday, \"I know this: President Xi loves the people of China, he loves his country, and he's doing a very good job with a very, very tough situation.\"\n\nIt has become a staple of the Trump administration: sending mixed messages that reflect a good-cop-bad-cop tactic, a real internal disagreement over policy or simply the caprice of the president. But over all, the most hawkish voices on China have dominated the conversation, lashing out at Beijing as it reels from one challenge after another -- a trade war with Washington, protests in Hong Kong and now the struggle to contain the coronavirus.\n\nMr. Trump's conciliatory comments this week might be an effort to defuse tensions and keep the U.S. economy humming as he faces re-election. That approach is backed by a pro-trade faction led by Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, which advocates close ties between the world's two largest economies.\n\nWhether it is because of the assertiveness of the hard-liners, the ambiguities fueled by the competing messages or Beijing's policies, the relationship between the United States and China has become so strained and unpredictable that even the need for a united effort to address a global health crisis has not overcome the suspicions that have increasingly taken root on both sides.\n\nReporting and research was contributed by Russell Goldman, Sui-Lee Wee, Steven Lee Myers, Elaine Yu, Tiffany May, Edward

U.S. stocks fell for the second straight day on Friday, with the S&P closing more than 1 percent lower, putting it on pace for its worst day of the month.

Already, cases of travelers from Iran testing positive for the virus have turned up in Canada and Lebanon.\n\nThe United States now has 34 cases, with more expected, and Italy experienced a spike from three cases to 17 and ordered mandatory quarantine measures.\n\n\"The cases that we see in the rest of the world, although the numbers are small, but not linked to Wuhan or China, it's very worrisome,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said Friday at a news conference at the agency's headquarters in Geneva. \"These dots are actually very concerning.\"\n\nFrench companies are warned against 'overdependence' on China.\n\nThe French government said Friday it would urge companies to review their \"overdependence\" on China for raw materials and parts as the coronavirus outbreak exposes weaknesses among French manufacturers that have outsourced their supply chains there.\n\nFinance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the government had ordered a review of which strategic industries have grown too reliant on China for production, and is looking at ways to start bringing some production back to France or Europe.\n\nHe singled out automakers, which have had trouble getting parts like brake pedals, and the pharmaceutical industry, which gets 80 percent of the raw materials for some drugs from China and Asia.\n\n\"The epidemic shows that supply bottlenecks create problems in certain strategic industries,\" Mr. Le Maire said after meeting with French business leaders about the economic fallout of the epidemic.\n\nThe government estimated the economy may shrink by around 0.1 percent this year as result of the outbreak.\n\nThe government will help French companies affected by the virus by extending deadlines for paying taxes and encouraging big firms, especially in the luxury industry, to go easy on smaller suppliers having trouble filling orders.\n\nFrance is also studying whether to allow companies to declare the coronavirus a \"force majeur,\" which relieves firms from liabilities for breach of contract because of circumstances beyond their control.\n\nWuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is home to more than one third of all French investment in China.\n\nCrisis in China affects the skies: 13,000 flight cancellations.\n\nThe disappearance of tens of thousands of flights from China's skies in recent weeks points to how the coronavirus has hobbled a nation.\n\nWithin just three weeks -- from Jan. 23 to Feb. 13 -- daily departures and arrivals for domestic and international flights in China dropped to just 2,004, from 15,072, according to Flightradar24, an industry data firm.\n\nRestrictive measures adopted by China have helped delay the spread of the virus to other countries, the World Health Organization said this week, but the country's increasing isolation could have lasting economic consequences.\n\nChinese travelers account for about a fifth of all tourism spending, more than any other country, according to the U.N.'s World Tourism Organization. In 2018, Chinese residents spent $277 billion abroad, according to the United Nations, or nearly twice as much as residents of the United States.\n\nOxford Economics said in a new report that, in a worst-case scenario, the outbreak could cut $1.1 trillion in global output.\n\nReporting was contributed by Liz Alderman, Vivian Wang, Choe Sang-Hun, Donald G.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/travel/answers-to-travelers-questions-about-the-coronavirus.html", "title": "Answers to Travelers' Questions About the Coronavirus", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak that has sickened almost 75,000 in China and killed more than 2,000 worldwide, has upended travel and commerce across the world. In light of the spread of the disease, which has been named COVID-19, would-be travelers to Asia and even parts of the world with few or no cases are wondering what to do.\n\nThe Times asked readers for their most pressing questions and got a flurry of queries: Should I cancel my trip to Asia, despite the financial penalties? Or go ahead? What about going to other parts of the world? How hard is it to disinfect an airplane, anyway, and is a mask enough to protect from the virus?\n\nFor anyone planning to travel, the website of the World Health Organization is a good starting point. (W.H.O. has been issuing daily updates about the spread of COVID-19 and the status of cases.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has advised Americans to cancel all nonessential travel to China, also offers information and guides for travelers. The Times has a map of the number of cases reported in each country.\n\nIn addition to those agencies, travelers should consult the websites of their home country and their intended destination to see what policies have been put in place.\n\n\"You should also be double careful to do the things we say everyone should always do like hand washing with soap and water, especially after touching surfaces or coming in contact with someone who has been coughing,\" said David Eisenman, director of University of California, Los Angeles's Center for Public Health and Disasters, and professor of community health sciences at the university's Fielding School of Public Health. \"You should be avoiding close contact with others if you're sick and you should have your flu shot.\"\n\nHere are some of the most common questions and the current advice from health and travel experts. Questions have been combined and condensed for clarity.\n\nI have a trip planned that is not to Asia. Is it safe to go?\n\nReaders asked about destinations thousands of miles from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak started, including Ireland, Argentina and Vancouver (the last city made one traveler nervous because of its close ties to China).\n\nDr. Eisenman and other doctors said that from a medical standpoint, there isn't any current reason to skip a trip to a country where few or no cases of the coronavirus have been reported.\n\n\"You have to evaluate your trip week to week, if not day to day,\" said Bernard Camins, medical director for infection prevention at the Mount Sinai Health System. \"But if you're looking at a place where there are no cases, there's no question you should continue on your trip.\" (Dr. Camins has trips to Europe planned for this spring and is not canceling.)\n\nThe question becomes more difficult the closer to the heart of the outbreak you are planning to travel, Dr. Camins said. In places like Singapore and Thailand, there have been cases, but there is no evidence that there is a lot of person-to-person transmission and the virus doesn't seem to be out of control, he said. \"The chances of you running into a person with it there is low, unless you're a health care professional and you're going to work in a hospital,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"The golden rule for travel right now should be this: If you're the one who is sick, stay home, do not travel, wear a mask, even for the flu.\"\n\nSteve Kuriga, an independent travel adviser at Cadence, a San Diego agency affiliated with the Virtuoso network said, \"It's a personal decision, but unless you're going through an infected area I don't see any reason to put off your travels.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nMr. Kuriga added that he has clients who are looking at South America as an alternative to Asia for an upcoming trip because no cases of COVID-19 have been reported there.\n\nI have a trip planned to Vietnam in April, what is the situation in that country?\n\nThere have been 16 confirmed infections, no deaths, 14 recoveries and 1,538 quarantined cases in Vietnam. The country's prime minister officially declared COVID-19 an epidemic in Vietnam on Feb. 1, and authorities closed land borders with China, indefinitely stopped flights to and from China, and instituted a 14-day quarantine for anyone coming from affected areas in China. The government is also encouraging people to avoid public gatherings at the moment.\n\nAlthough some cities that have registered infections have closed tourist attractions and heritage sites, the majority are still open to the public. Many festivals and events are going on as planned, but others have been postponed. For a detailed list, consult Vietnam's tourism site, which has detailed information about traveling to the country.\n\nWhat about Cambodia?\n\nUntil recently, Cambodia said it had only one case of the coronavirus and Prime Minister Hun Sen made a point of not wearing a surgical mask in public. But then a passenger on the Westerdam, a Holland America Line boat that had been blocked from docking in five countries over fear of the virus, was diagnosed with COVID-19 disease after disembarking from the ship in Sihanoukville, throwing into question how well the virus was being contained.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has a Level 1 warning about traveling to Cambodia, which means that in its assessment there is currently no danger in traveling to the country. You can keep up-to-date with the department's advisories at its website.\n\nI am scheduled for a layover at Singapore's Changi Airport. Is that a problem?\n\nAs of Wednesday, Singapore had 84 cases of coronavirus, but transiting through the airport is unlikely to bring travelers in contact with any of the sick. Earlier this month the airport implemented rules to help keep the virus at bay. Anyone who has traveled to mainland China within 14 days of arriving at Changi is not allowed to enter Singapore or to travel through it. Additionally, Singapore's Immigration and Checkpoints Authority suspended the issuance of new visas to people with Chinese passports. The airport also said it increased the frequency with which the airport is being cleaned and is using more disinfectants in the cleaning process.\n\nMr. Kuriga said that in his estimation, \"Right now it's safe to travel through there, but like with everything else, keep checking.\"\n\nDo airlines sanitize planes between flights? Are they instituting any new policies?\n\nPlanes are small spaces with a lot of people on them, and can be involved in transmitting diseases. While it's not clear if most airlines are changing their cleaning procedures because of the coronavirus, we do know how they typically clean airplane cabins.\n\n\"At Southwest, aircraft undergo regular cleanings in between flights, and a comprehensive cleaning when the aircraft is parked overnight,\" a spokesman for the airline said. When the plane is cleaned, surfaces -- including tray tables, seats and carpets -- are cleaned.\n\nCurtis Blessing, a spokesman for American Airlines said planes are cleaned on a regular basis and the depth of the cleaning varies, depending on turn times and type of flight, but bathrooms are cleaned, floors are spot cleaned and visible trash is removed from seat pockets on all flights.\n\n\"When ground time allows, galleys are cleaned, as are tray tables,\" Mr. Blessing said. \"Transcontinental, Hawaii and international flights see an even deeper level of cleaning that includes cleaning of lavatories, tray tables and galley areas, as well as any surface areas throughout the aircraft. Floors are also vacuumed.\"\n\nDelta is supplying kits with hand sanitizer, gloves and surgical masks to passengers on all flights to and from Asia. A Delta spokeswoman said the airline's planes are \"thoroughly cleaned for the safety of our customers and crew.\"\n\nA spokesman for Alaska Air said that bathrooms on the airline's planes are cleaned between every flight, and tray tables are cleaned when a layover is longer than an hour. A thorough cleaning of the plane happens whenever a plane stays at an airport overnight.\n\n\"Our existing cleaning and disinfecting chemicals are effective against viruses, and nothing about the novel coronavirus indicates that it's resistant to these efforts,\" he said.\n\nWhat about a cruise ship?\n\nCruise lines have learned how to combat the norovirus after more than two decades of outbreaks, but some passengers still get sick.\n\nRoss Klein, a sociologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland who studies the cruise industry, said, \"The cruise ships are well trained in 'killing' a virus and are quite proficient if they follow what they know and the protocols they have for norovirus.\"\n\nThose protocols don't seem to have been followed on the Diamond Princess, the cruise boat that was quarantined in Yokohama, Japan, for two weeks and had 621 sick passengers, he said. The quarantine has been criticized by experts for failing to keep COVID-19 from spreading between passengers and crew members, and two passengers on the ship have died. \"But that doesn't mean the ship can't be sanitized before taking on new passengers,\" Mr. Klein said. \"It is no more difficult than a land-based hotel.\"\n\nIs a mask sufficient to protect me on an airplane?\n\nW.H.O. says that if you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of someone with a suspected coronavirus infection. The organization also suggests wearing the mask if you are the person sneezing or coughing.\n\n\"Masks are only effective when used in combination with frequent hand cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water,\" the organization says in its guide about how to best choose a mask, use it and dispose of it.\n\nThe type of mask also makes a difference. An N95 mask reduces a wearer's exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets, according to the C.D.C., which has a guide for understanding the differences between a regular surgical mask and an N95 respirator.\n\nMy flight has been canceled, but my travel insurance won't pay. How, in the middle of a medical crisis, could that not be considered a qualifying event for travel insurance?\n\nBizarre as it may sound, standard travel insurance doesn't cover losses caused by a global health crisis -- even one that's been declared \"a public health emergency of international concern\" by W.H.O. and for which the C.D.C. has issued a Level 3 travel notice recommending that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to China.\n\nWhen it comes to travel insurance, so-called Cancel For Any Reason upgrades are the best course here. But they're also very expensive and tend to cover only 50 to 75 percent of your trip, said Stan Sandberg, an industry expert and co-founder of TravelInsurance.com, a site that allows travelers to compare and buy travel insurance online.\n\n\"It's important to note that with Cancel For Any Reason coverage, the insurance policy must be purchased within a set amount of days -- usually 21 days or fewer, depending on the plan -- after making the first payment for the trip, and the entire prepaid and nonrefundable cost of the trip must be insured. The trip must also be canceled more than 48 hours before the departure date,\" Mr. Sandberg said.\n\nAt Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection, for example, CFAR coverage costs an additional 40 percent of your total travel insurance premium.\n\nThe risk-reward ratio will vary by traveler. In addition to ratings and reviews of specific policies, TravelInsurance.com's information about the claims process -- and their respective outcomes -- may be helpful in determining whether or not CFAR coverage is worth the outlay.\n\nMy credit card provides travel insurance. Will that actually do anything for me?\n\nThe short answer: Not really.\n\nTrip cancellation and interruption insurance, designed to reimburse certain nonrefundable expenses when a trip is canceled or delayed, is a perk of many travel-focused credits cards, including the American Express Platinum and Delta SkyMiles Reserve, as well as both Chase Sapphire cards (Preferred and Reserve).\n\nBut what's actually covered varies, and health crises are particularly unforgiving to consumers. Chase Sapphire cards, for example, will only reimburse you if you're quarantined \"due to health reasons by a competent governmental authority having jurisdiction\" -- but not a \"disinclination to travel due to an epidemic or pandemic.\" In other words, if you choose not to travel -- even to quite reasonably avoid a region affected by the coronavirus -- trip cancellation and interruption insurance won't help. American Express doesn't have explicit epidemic inclusions (or exclusions), but cardholders might have luck claiming reimbursement by getting a doctor's note stating that \"a covered trip is medically inadvisable.\"\n\nWhat if I'm immune-compromised and have a doctor's note to that effect. Still no refunds?\n\nOlder adults and people with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease. According to medical experts, many of those who have died in the coronavirus outbreak had pre-existing conditions that weakened their ability to fight it. Travelers with an immune-suppressed system should talk to their health care providers before traveling.\n\nMr. Kuriga, the travel adviser in San Diego, said that it's a good idea to reach out to a travel agent or the travel company you booked a trip with because some companies might be flexible in their cancellation and refund policies.\n\n\"Not all companies are coming up with broad policies,\" he said. \"Some companies are dealing with it on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nI am planning to go to Japan. If I decide to travel anyway, what is the best way to arrange for medical assistance if I need it?\n\nThe simplest precaution is to purchase medical travel insurance, in particular, a primary-coverage plan that substitutes for your existing United States health insurance while you're abroad. Look for hefty emergency medical coverage (at least $50,000, according to most experts) and emergency medical transportation coverage (upward of $100,000, depending on how remote your destination is). Deductibles, waivers for pre-existing conditions, and pricing vary by a number of factors; you can comparison-shop on TravelInsurance.com, Squaremouth, and a host of other sites.\n\n52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Discover the best places to go in 2020, and find more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.

Expected", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nAt least 34 people in the United States are infected with the new coronavirus spreading from China, federal health officials said on Friday.\n\nThirteen of the infections were diagnosed in the country, and 21 in people returning from overseas.\n\nMore infections are expected among the people who were passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise and are currently in quarantine, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news briefing.\n\nBecause they may have been in contact with infected people on the ship, \"they are considered at high risk for infection,\" Dr. Messonnier said.\n\nTen other passengers from the Diamond Princess tested positive in Japan, but are not being counted among the infected yet, because the tests have not been confirmed by the C.D.C. However, they will likely be added to the case count, Dr. Messonnier said.\n\nSeveral Americans remain critically ill with the infection in Japanese hospitals. They were among the passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was overwhelmed with infections after it docked in Yokahama, Japan.\n\nAs of Friday, the coronavirus has infected 75,000 people, the vast majority in mainland China, and has killed 2,236.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\n\"This new virus represents a tremendous public health threat,\" Dr. Messonnier said.\n\nPlease check back for updates on this developing story.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

Officials Start to Push Back on Coronavirus Quarantine Plans", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe scramble to find places to quarantine American coronavirus patients is beginning to run into resistance from local officials who do not want the patients housed in their backyards.\n\nThe city of Costa Mesa, Calif., has gone to court to block state and federal officials, at least temporarily, from placing dozens of people evacuated from Asia in a state-owned residential center in their community.\n\nAnd Alabama officials have reacted with alarm to news that coronavirus patients could be sent as early as Wednesday to a Federal Emergency Management building on a former army base in Anniston, Ala., about 90 miles west of Atlanta.\n\nUncertainty and distrust are stymieing federal attempts to plan for quarantining Americans who are infected with the coronavirus. At least 34 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus, most of them after traveling abroad, and the authorities have warned of the seriousness of the threat.\n\nSo far, no one in the United States has died of the disease, and at least four patients in this country are said to have fully recovered. Yet local officials have expressed concerns that little is being done to prepare for a potential influx of patients, and that much is still unknown about the virus, which has killed at least 2,461 people, all but 19 of them in mainland China.\n\nAt a hastily called news conference on Saturday, elected officials in Costa Mesa, a city of 113,000 people about 40 miles south of Los Angeles, expressed opposition to a state plan to send dozens of patients to the Fairview Developmental Center, a nearly vacant state hospital formerly used for people with developmental disabilities.\n\n\"We're a compassionate community,\" said the city's mayor, Katrina Foley. \"But we are not going to continue to be the place where everybody drops off their crises and expects us to correct it.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak How Is the U.S. Being Affected?\n\nUpdated Feb. 22, 2020\n\nA look at how local health departments are struggling to monitor thousands of people returning to the U.S. from China. At least 34 cases have been confirmed in the U.S. and more infections are expected. A woman returning from Wuhan, China, gave us a look at life inside a coronavirus quarantine center in the U.S. An Omaha hospital that drew attention for treating Ebola patients is now playing a key role again. A couple tested positive after returning from vacation in Hawaii. One of the people evacuated from Wuhan last week to San Diego had coronavirus but was discharged because of a labeling error. The outbreak has left some Asian-Americans feeling an unsettling level of public scrutiny. Some evacuees are wondering why they aren't being tested on bases. Pittsburgh, Wuhan's \"sister city,\" has been shaken by the outbreak and is sending aid to relatives and friends trapped in the center of a deadly outbreak. There was a race to contain the disease after one man's cough became confirmation of America's first case. Many who recently traveled to China are isolating themselves in 'self quarantines' for 14 days. Most experts agree: To protect yourself wash your hands and avoid touching your face. Tips to not get sick while traveling. Affected by travel? Or do you know someone who is? Please contact us at coronavirus@nytimes.com if you are willing to be contacted by a reporter or have your comments used for a coming story.\n\nThe patients involved would be people now quarantined at Travis Air Force Base who have tested positive for the coronavirus but do not have severe symptoms requiring hospital care. Several people confirmed to have the virus are quarantined in their homes across the United States, but that is not an option for some, including people who do not live alone; the authorities are trying to find a secure place for them to stay. Wherever they go, they would be kept away from contact with the public until the danger of contagion passes.\n\nLocal officials in Costa Mesa were told of the plan on Thursday night, and filed a request for an emergency injunction in federal court on Friday. The court issued a temporary injunction, pending a hearing at 2 p.m. on Monday, when it will consider whether to extend it.\n\n\"Of course we want people to be cared for,\" Ms. Foley said in an interview on Sunday. \"We just don't think this is an appropriate site,\" she said, noting that it was next to a golf course, a soccer field and a densely populated residential neighborhood.\n\nThe mayor, who is running for a State Senate seat as a Democrat, said she was told on a conference call with federal officials on Friday that the military wanted the coronavirus patients moved off all its bases to eliminate the risk that troops would be exposed.\n\n\"I don't want anyone exposed, military or otherwise,\" Ms. Foley said.\n\nThe city's 14-page request for a restraining order lists as defendants a group of state and federal actors, including the Defense Department, the Air Force, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the State of California and Gov. Gavin Newsom's Office for Emergency Services.\n\n\"Plaintiffs now seek to prevent Costa Mesa from becoming ground zero to a state and potentially nationwide public health crisis caused because the state and federal governments have not sought to include local officials and emergency personnel in the planning and execution of their efforts,\" the city told the court in its filing.\n\nThe federal government responded by telling the court that the city's request was \"ill-informed and legally baseless\" and that it \"endangers the safety and well-being of the American people\" by interfering with state and federal efforts to cope with the crisis.\n\n\"Instead of providing public-health expertise (or any expertise), plaintiffs ask this court to rely on internet statements and speculation,\" the federal response said, adding that the center in Costa Mesa \"would be better for public health than the alternatives, which consist of using hospitals or home isolation.\"\n\nThe city appeared to acknowledge that it might be powerless to stop the state from sending patients to the center. In its court filing, it instead asked the court to order that \"the state and federal government stop acting under the cover of darkness,\" and that they provide the city's emergency personnel with appropriate training to deal with the coronavirus.\n\nThe question of where to house infected patients gained urgency on Saturday after the federal government indicated that people with the virus who were evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan could not remain at the air base.\n\n\"These people are at Travis Air Force Base right now -- why can't they stay there?\" said Jennifer L. Keller a lawyer in Irvine, Calif., who helped Costa Mesa file for the injunction.\n\nThe city questioned whether the Fairview center was in good enough repair to be used for quarantine housing. As recently as Feb. 5, the city said in its court filing, state officials deemed it unsuitable for an emergency homeless shelter without extensive renovations.\n\nIn her ruling on Friday, U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton wrote that the state's plan to move patients to Costa Mesa as early as Sunday \"without conducting an adequate site survey or providing sufficient safeguards against transmission of the disease\" constituted an immediate threat.\n\nGov. Kay Ivey of Alabama said in a statement on Sunday that she learned late Friday night about a plan by the Health and Human Services Department to relocate some patients evacuated from the Diamond Princess to the former army base in Anniston. She quickly informed Alabama's senators and members of Congress, prompting two rounds of conference calls among Alabama elected officials, federal health officials and the White House.\n\n\"I made it abundantly clear that while the state of Alabama wants to work closely with the Trump administration to assist fellow Americans who may have tested positive for the coronavirus, there were some grave concerns about why the site in Anniston was chosen and how, logistically, this would play out,\" the governor's statement said. \"First and foremost, my priority is to protect the people of Alabama.\"\n\nThe Alabama Department of Public Health later issued a statement saying it had been assured by federal officials that the plan to house patients in Anniston was only a backup plan in case facilities in other states could not handle the load, and that no patients were scheduled to be sent to Alabama.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/21/multimedia/21coronavirus-diary.html", "title": "Fourteen Days of Solitude: A Diary", "body": "Blair Zong, 33, lives in San Jose, Calif., and works at a startup company. She was visiting her mother and grandparents in Wuhan, China, where she grew up, when the coronavirus outbreak became an epidemic.\n\nShe is among hundreds of Americans who were evacuated on flights arranged by the United States government and are waiting through mandatory 14-day quarantines on military bases.\n\nShe agreed to keep a daily journal of her time in quarantine. Here is some of her diary, edited for length and clarity.\n\nDay 1\n\nThe U.S. embassy staff checked my body temperature, and gave me a green wristband. The color represented which flight I would take. One other U.S. flight was going out, too, and people were given yellow wristbands for that.\n\nDay 2\n\nWhen we got off the airplane at a military base in San Diego, workers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stood by in navy blue jackets with huge C.D.C. logos.\n\nEverything looked like the movie \"Contagion.\"\n\nDay 5\n\nI made myself a cup of coffee. Looking out of the window from my room, it's a beautiful dawn view. I cannot even grasp where I am and what I am going through. The jet lag hit me badly.\n\nI checked my phone. One message dragged me back to the reality in Wuhan. One of my friends texted to say that his grandma and auntie both passed away from the coronavirus. His dad was still in the hospital.\n\nAll of it took me back to everything I had seen in Wuhan.\n\nDay 5\n\nRight before I left Wuhan, I went to my grandparents' home with my mom to say goodbye. That was the first time I saw my grandpa cry. I could not hug or even touch them.\n\nMy grandma handed me a bag with a red envelope and a letter my grandpa had written to me. I held my tears and said goodbye.\n\nDay 6\n\nBack on the base, two people in quarantine have tested positive for the coronavirus. People are starting to question the C.D.C. staff.\n\nI have so many questions in my mind, too. But I trust the staff who have supported us since this started and are working 14 hours a day.\n\n\"We're the lucky ones,\" I keep saying to people in here. Obviously, not everybody thinks like me. They wrote a petition asking for coronavirus tests for everyone.\n\nDay 6\n\nWe went to a town hall of the people in quarantine. A C.D.C. officer told us that someone with coronavirus was accidentally brought back to the base briefly because of a testing mistake.\n\nPeople were very angry. They were anxious and wanted to know the names of people who are ill. For privacy reasons, the C.D.C. officer didn't tell us. I understand people's concerns, but I think it's overreacting and pointless.\n\nDay 8\n\nI am not the kind of person who likes to celebrate these sorts of special days. I'm single now, so I have no feeling about Valentine's Day. (Keep calm and carry on.)\n\nBut I wanted to do something to break up this long and boring quarantine. So I ordered Godiva chocolate and gift cards online. I wanted to share them with my dear \"neighbors\" here in quarantine, two young professional women.\n\nI knocked on my neighbors' doors and -- keeping the 6-foot distance we've been asked to keep -- passed the bags to them.\n\nDay 8\n\nI went to the regular temperature check in the morning. I gave the C.D.C. staff a Valentine's Day note.\n\nDay 8\n\nAfter about 10 days in quarantine, I actually see myself as happier than before. I've learned to check the phone less and focus on myself.\n\nI've read books that I hadn't finished for years. I worked a puzzle in my room alone for six hours.\n\nDay 8\n\nWhat am I missing the most? The dish my mom and grandma cooked for me when I was in Wuhan.\n\nIn here, I spend two or three hours a day contacting my family and friends in Wuhan. I have made new friends here and we talk during breakfast. But mostly I don't go outside or spend time with other people.\n\nDay 9\n\nThe mood has changed a lot here, day by day. The first couple of days, I was feeling safe and finally could sleep better. After the two confirmed cases came out, I felt scared and panicky a little while.\n\nDay 9\n\nI'm not a doctor or a professional, but I've been through this. On a physical level, protection is a must. Wear face masks and wash your hands properly and use sanitizer frequently. But on a mental level, do not overreact!\n\nDay 9\n\nWe should feel sorry for the people who died because of it. Be respectful to people who are working on it and trying to fix the problem. We should appreciate that we're the lucky ones.\n\nDon't put your hate and anxiety on others. It doesn't solve anything.\n\nDay 14\n\nThe whole morning was busy, with packing and checking out from the inn on the military base.\n\nWe all got a yellow A4-size envelope with a letter stating that we are not a coronavirus risk.\n\nDay 14\n\nI am waiting for a flight in San Diego's airport. It feels so unreal after these days: Everything is normal. No one is wearing face masks. People are sitting around me eating lunch and discussing their lives.\n\nI need some time to adjust my mind. It has been a long wait and a journey to get back home.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Great Leap Backward", "body": "Expelling Wall Street Journal reporters returns China to a darker age.\n\nSeveral years ago, in an overheated room in Beijing, I was forced to endure a stern lecture from a Chinese foreign ministry official. My sin: As the editor at The Wall Street Journal responsible for the paper's overseas opinion sections, I had apparently insulted the entire Chinese people by publishing the work of a \"well-known terrorist\" -- the courageous Uighur human-rights activist Rebiya Kadeer.\n\nI had to clench my jaw to suppress the rejoinder that China's best-known tyrant, Mao Zedong, has his portrait overlooking the killing field known as Tiananmen Square.\n\nI thought of that episode this week on hearing Wednesday's news that the Chinese government has decided to expel three Wall Street Journal reporters based in China -- two Americans and an Australian -- in retaliation for the headline of an opinion column by Walter Russell Mead, \"China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia.\" In a style reminiscent of my own experience, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement claiming, \"The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and smear China with malicious attacks.\"\n\nAny reader of Mead's column, headline and text alike, will note that there isn't an iota of racism in it, though it makes a devastating case about the ways in which the coronavirus epidemic has exposed the broader fragility of the Chinese system. And those familiar with The Wall Street Journal will know that the paper, like The Times, enforces a strict separation between its news and opinion sections -- meaning the reporters facing expulsion had absolutely nothing to do with the writing and publication of Mead's column.\n\nBut factual accuracy is irrelevant in a political scapegoating exercise, which is what this strike on the Journal is all about. And this does more to underscore Mead's broader point about China's inherent weaknesses than it does to contradict it.\n\nWhat are those weaknesses? Demographers point to China's falling birthrate, aging population and gender gap. Economists cite its faltering productivity, its made-up statistics and its giant debt bomb. And political analysts point to ever more repressive policies from Beijing, leading to ever greater discontent from Hong Kong to Xinjiang.\n\nBut the coronavirus crisis has exposed a far-deeper weakness: The Chinese regime fears information.\n\nIt was just this fear that, as my colleague Nick Kristof pointed out, led the government to suppress news about the new virus -- and punish whistle-blowing doctors -- when it should have done the opposite, swiftly, so as to better contain its spread. The result was the loss of the critical time in fighting the disease, all but guaranteeing the global health crisis that followed.\n\nThis sort of behavior is nothing new for the Chinese government: It mishandled the 2003 SARS epidemic in much the same way. Nor is the problem specific to China: Any regime that depends on the manipulation or manufacture of \"truth\" for its own survival is bound to act in similar ways. That's one of the reasons Donald Trump's nonstop lying and misstatements of fact aren't just immoral but also dangerous. Truth driven underground doesn't vanish. It stalks.\n\nBut the problem for the Chinese is much more acute, for the simple reason that they don't have genuinely independent domestic journalism. That means that ordinary people have no access to timely, accurate and comprehensive information -- and neither do China's rulers. The result is rumor, which can be dangerous; ignorance, which can be fatal; and miscalculation, which can be catastrophic.\n\nThe move against The Wall Street Journal will compound the regime's problems, since reporting by foreign news organizations has often been critical in filling the omissions and straightening the distortions of China's official media. It was The Journal that did some of the most pathbreaking work to expose the scale of the country's environmental catastrophes, just as it was The Times that exposed the extent of graft at the top of the Chinese leadership pyramid. Other news outlets, particularly Reuters, have done vital reporting on the frauds and scams endemic in China's economy.\n\nSuppress this kind of reporting, and the first people who will suffer information blindness are China's leaders. Every dictator needs subscriptions to The Journal and The Times, even if they come -- like smutty magazines of yore -- in inconspicuous brown envelopes.\n\nIt's always possible that the regime will think better of its move to expel the reporters, or at least quietly let them return in a few weeks' time. Wise leaders, facing a monumental crisis brought on by their own irrational distrust of information, would at least learn the lessons of their folly. But there might be a truth in China even more frightening than the coronavirus -- foolish rulers.\n\nFor that, no vaccine has ever been invented.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
