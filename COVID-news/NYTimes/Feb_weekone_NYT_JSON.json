Many of them -- 41 percent -- were presumed to have caught the virus in the hospital, including 17 people who had been admitted for other illnesses, and 40 health care workers.\n\nThe patient who infected so many health workers had been placed in a surgical ward because of abdominal symptoms, and the coronavirus was not initially suspected. Four other patients in that ward also contracted the disease, presumably from the first patient.\n\nThe incident was a chilling reminder of the \"super-spreaders\" in outbreaks of other coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS -- patients who infected huge numbers of other people, sometimes dozens. The phenomenon is poorly understood and unpredictable, an epidemiologist's nightmare. Super-spreaders led to considerable transmission of MERS and SARS inside hospitals.\n\nReporting on Friday in JAMA, the authors said their data suggested that rapid person-to-person spread of the virus had occurred among their cases. That was in part because of patients like the one admitted to the surgical department, whose symptoms misled doctors into suspecting other illnesses and failing to take precautions to prevent spread of the virus until it was too late.\n\nAbout 10 percent of the patients did not initially have the usual symptoms, cough and fever, but instead had diarrhea and nausea first. Other uncommon symptoms included headache, dizziness and abdominal pain.\n\nAnother cause for concern was that some patients who at first appeared mildly or moderately ill then took a turn for the worse several days or even a week into their illness. The median time from their first symptoms to when they became short of breath was five days; to hospitalization, seven days; and to severe breathing trouble, eight days. Experts say that pattern means patients must be carefully monitored, and it is not safe to assume that someone who seems to be doing well early on is out of the woods.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nThe finding is a \"heads up\" to doctors to keep an eye on these patients, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a recorded interview posted by JAMA.\n\nLike previous reports on coronavirus patients, this one found that older people and those with underlying health problems like diabetes, heart disease or cancer tended to become more severely ill than younger, healthier patients.\n\nOver all, about 26 percent of the 138 patients needed intensive care; their median age was 66, compared with a median of 51 years for those who did not require intensive care.\n\nFor this series of patients, the death rate was 4.3 percent, which is higher than the estimates coming from other parts of China. The reason is not known, and the figures may change as more information is gathered.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nUnlike some earlier reports, the new one did not find many more men than women to be infected: 54 percent of the patients were male.\n\nThe data on the patients shows that the illness caused pneumonia and a systemic viral infection that set off a powerful inflammatory response in the body, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said in an interview.\n\n\"There are biochemical indicators that a number of the body's organ systems are likely affected and you have an inflammatory response that is disrupting their function to some extent,\" Dr. Schaffner said.\n\nThe lungs, heart, liver, kidneys and the systems that control blood clotting are all affected, Dr. Schaffner said, though it is not clear that the virus itself infects organs other than the lungs.\n\nThe inflammatory response is a hallmark of a serious viral disease, he said, adding that in recent years it has become apparent that heightened inflammation from diseases like the flu can persist for a month or so after the acute illness is gone, and can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes in older people.\n\nThe second JAMA report concerns 13 patients treated in three hospitals in Beijing from Jan. 16 to Jan. 29. They were younger than the Wuhan group, with a median age of 34, and no underlying diseases. Only one was over 50. The youngest was a 2-year-old. They did not become as ill as the Wuhan patients, and none died.\n\nThe cases, mostly in healthy, young adults, should dispel the notion that only older people contract the illness.\n\n\"It can take a young, healthy person and make them sick,\" Dr. Schaffner said. \"That's clear from the health care workers and the young people in this paper.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

"C.D.C. and W.H.O. Offers to Help China Have Been Ignored for Weeks", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nFor more than a month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been offering to send a team of experts to China to observe its coronavirus outbreak and help if it can.\n\nNormally, teams from the agency's Epidemic Intelligence Service can be in the air within 24 hours.\n\nBut no invitation has come -- and no one can publicly explain why.\n\nThe World Health Organization, which made a similar offer about two weeks ago, appears to be facing the same cold shoulder, though a spokeswoman said it is just \"sorting out arrangements.\"\n\nCurrent and former public health officials and diplomats, speaking anonymously for fear of upsetting diplomatic relations, said they believe the reluctance comes from China's top leaders, who do not want the world to think they need outside help.\n\nIn 2003, China was badly stung by criticism of its response to SARS, another coronavirus epidemic; it has also been embroiled in a trade war with the United States for more than a year.\n\nSome experts also say that outsiders could discover aspects of the outbreak that are embarrassing to China: for example, the country has not revealed how many of its doctors and nurses have died fighting the disease.\n\nBut China does need help, experts argue.\n\nIn private phone calls and texts, some Chinese colleagues have indicated that they are overwhelmed and would welcome not just extra hands, but specialized expertise in a couple of fields.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map.

American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine.

Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nAlso, C.D.C. officials have said that they hope to learn more about the new coronavirus from their Chinese counterparts to improve the American response if the virus starts to spread widely here.\n\nOn Friday, Alex M. Azar II, secretary of health and human services, said at a news briefing that he had recently reiterated the offer of a team to his Chinese counterpart, Dr. Ma Xiaowei.\n\nAsked what the holdup was, he answered: \"It's up to the Chinese. We continue to expect fully that President Xi will accept our offer. We're ready and willing and able to go.\"\n\nOn Jan. 29, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director general, returned from a brief trip to China full of praise for President Xi Jinping and the country's extraordinarily aggressive response, which has nearly walled off Hubei Province from the rest of the country and the world.\n\nChina had \"agreed to a mission of international experts\" to better understand disease transmission and clinical severity, Dr. Michael Ryan, the W.H.O's emergency response chief, said at the time.\n\nAsked if that team would include American experts, Dr. Tedros replied that \"best would be a bilateral arrangement.\"\n\nOn Thursday, a W.H.O. spokeswoman said that there was no delay in the organization's own mission to China.\n\n\"Our understanding is that the mission is on,\" Marcia Poole, the spokeswoman, said. But she could not say when the team would leave or who would be on it.\n\n\"It's a matter of sorting out the arrangements,\" she added, noting that Dr. Ryan had said a team would \"need representation from North and South, East and West, with relevant areas of expertise.\"\n\nThe United States has offered Dr. Tedros 13 specialists who are ready to go, Mr. Azar said.\n\nThe two fields in which China appears to need outside help, experts said, are molecular virology and epidemiology.\n\nThe first involves sequencing the virus's genome and manipulating it to refine diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccine candidates.\n\nThe second involves figuring out basic questions like who gets infected and who does not, how long the incubation period is, why some victims die, how many other people each victim infects and how commonly hospital outbreaks are occurring.\n\n\"This isn't rocket science, it's basic stuff -- but it's been five weeks and we still don't know the answers,\" one expert said.\n\nIt would be very useful, for example, to have a blood test for antibodies. That would make it possible to see how many infected people had recovered, which would make it clearer as to how lethal the virus is -- and how widespread.\n\nA major epidemiological failure by China is that the Wuhan authorities appear to have closed and disinfected the seafood market that was the outbreak's early focus without swabbing individual animals and their cages and without drawing blood from everyone working there. That would have provided a wealth of information about which animal might have been the source of the coronavirus and which people had become infected but survived.\n\nAsked what had happened to the animals -- whether they had been burned or buried, for instance, one expert said: \"No one can tell me that. I don't think they know.\"\n\nChina has greatly improved its ability to fight disease since it was embarrassed by SARS, and its scientists now frequently publish in major medical journals.\n\nMany of them trained at the American C.D.C. and have friends there.\n\n\"We have a decade-long relationship,\" Mr. Azar said Friday. \"It's not an accident that it's called the Chinese C.D.C.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nExperts raised a related concern: China's scientists are given large rewards for publishing in prestigious journals. That creates an incentive to hold back samples and data until publication. Although the American C.D.C. has in the past sometimes had fraught relations with other countries because it used their samples and published analyses of them without giving credit they felt was due, its first priority was still to issue epidemic warnings if they were needed and then to publish later.\n\n\"In an epidemic, you don't want information held back,\" one expert said. \"You want transparency.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak", "type": "wiki",

SARS did.Xi stays out of the spotlight, but he might not escape blame.The illness gets a name, for now.The new coronavirus has killed more people than SARS did.\n\nThe coronavirus death toll in China has risen to 811, surpassing the toll from the SARS epidemic of 2002-3, according to official data released on Sunday.\n\nThe number of confirmed infections rose to 37,198, according to China's National Health Commission. Eighty-nine deaths and 2,656 new cases were recorded in the preceding 24 hours, most of them in Hubei Province, the heart of the outbreak.\n\nThe SARS epidemic, which also began in China, killed 774 people worldwide. There have been only two confirmed deaths from the new coronavirus outside mainland China -- one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.\n\nMany doctors believe that deaths and infections from the current epidemic in China are undercounted because testing facilities at hospitals and laboratories are under severe strain.\n\nThe number of new cases confirmed in the country has stabilized in recent days, but World Health Organization officials cautioned against reading too much into those numbers, saying that Hubei and its capital city, Wuhan, were still in the midst of a \"very intense outbreak.\"\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 37,500 people in China and 24 other countries.\n\n\"It's very, very early to make any predictions,\" said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the W.H.O.'s health emergencies program. \"This is still a very, very intense outbreak in Wuhan and Hubei.\"\n\nThe measures put in place in Hubei appear to be \"paying off,\" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director general, but he warned that the course of outbreaks like these is unpredictable. \"We have to understand it with caution because it can show stability for a few days and then they can shoot up,\" he said. \"I've said it many times, it's slow now but it may accelerate.\"\n\nXi stays out of the spotlight, but he might not escape blame.\n\nFor China's leader, Xi Jinping, the outbreak is not just a health crisis, but a political one: a test of the authoritarian system he has built around himself. As his government struggles to contain the virus amid rising public discontent with its performance, the changes that Mr. Xi has ushered in could make it difficult for him to escape blame.\n\n\"It's a big shock to the legitimacy of the ruling party. I think it could be only second to the June 4 incident of 1989. It's that big,\" said Rong Jian, a writer about politics in Beijing, referring to the armed crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters that year.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\n\"There's no doubt about his control over power,\" he added, \"but the manner of control and its consequences have hurt his legitimacy and reputation.\"\n\nMr. Xi himself has recognized what is at stake, calling the outbreak \"a major test of China's system and capacity for governance.\"\n\nYet as China's battle with the coronavirus intensified, Mr. Xi put the country's No. 2 leader, Li Keqiang, in charge of a leadership group handling the emergency, effectively turning him into the public face of the government's response. It was Mr. Li who traveled to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, to visit doctors.\n\nThat was not without precedent, though it stood out in this crisis, after previous Chinese leaders had used times of disaster to try to show a more common touch. State television and newspapers almost always lead with fawning coverage of Mr. Xi's every move.\n\nMr. Xi's retreat from the spotlight, some analysts said, signaled an effort to insulate himself from a campaign that may falter and draw public ire. Yet Mr. Xi has consolidated power, sidelining or eliminating rivals, so there are few people left to blame when something goes wrong.\n\nThe illness gets a name, for now.\n\nThe Chinese government has announced a temporary name for the illness caused by the coronavirus, ordering the local authorities and the state news media to adopt it. In English, it will be called N.C.P., for novel coronavirus pneumonia, the national health commission said on Saturday.\n\nA final, official name will eventually be chosen by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The organization has submitted a name to a scientific journal for publication and hopes to reveal it within days, the BBC reported.\n\nThe naming of viral illnesses is a complicated matter that involves both science and public relations. Past names, like the Spanish flu or Rift Valley fever, have been seen as contributing to the stigmatization of countries or regions. In 2015, the World Health Organization issued new guidelines, after the choice of the name for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, was criticized.\n\nAs well as avoiding place names, those guidelines recommend not using people's names (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Chagas disease), animal names (swine flu, equine encephalitis), cultural or occupational references (Legionnaires' disease) or words that induce fear (unknown, death, fatal, epidemic).\n\nThe W.H.O. has recommended its own temporary name for the new illness: 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, or 2019-nCoV. But the name is difficult to pronounce, and has been less popular than \"coronavirus,\" which describes a larger category of viruses.\n\n\"We thought it was very important to put out an interim name so that no location was associated with the name,\" Maria Van Kerkhove, a W.H.O. epidemiologist, told the body's executive board on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Outbreak\n\nWUHAN, China -- More than 600 people have died. Tens of thousands are infected. Millions are living under lockdown, and the government has sought to silence complaints.\n\nBut what provoked an online revolt in China on Friday, the fiercest assault on the censors in almost a decade, began with the death of one man: the doctor who tried to raise an alarm about the coronavirus.\n\nThe deluge of mourning and anger at the death of the doctor, Li Wenliang -- from the same virus he was reprimanded for mentioning -- at times overwhelmed China's sophisticated censorship and propaganda systems. Many on social media called the doctor a martyr and a hero, and government officials, celebrities and business leaders risked rebuke by the Communist Party to join ordinary citizens in expressing frustration and grief.\n\n\"Li Wenliang's death has become an emotional flash point,\" said Wang Yu, a Wuhan man in his 20s, showing the torrent of comments on his phone about Dr. Li in his social media feeds.\n\n\"He's a tragic figure in this epidemic, and his death has taken this tragedy to a new extreme,\" Mr. Wang said. Then he hesitated and took back his words. \"I worry that his death won't be the extreme of this tragedy.\"\n\nThe doctor's death posed a new test for China's leader, Xi Jinping, who was already facing deep political problems -- over a newly signed trade deal with Washington, Taiwan's recent election and Hong Kong's protest movement -- before the virus spilled out of Wuhan. In recent weeks, Mr. Xi's talks with foreign leaders have shifted to a defense of China's response to the epidemic, which has sickened more than 31,000 people and brought the country to a near standstill.\n\nNow, the government is also caught in a tug of war over Dr. Li's legacy that could challenge Mr. Xi's powerful censorship apparatus.\n\nWhen Dr. Li, 34, warned of the virus in an online chat room more than five weeks ago, the police made him an example of what befalls those who do not comply with official demands for secrecy. He was summoned by the authorities and forced to sign a statement denouncing his warning as an unfounded and illegal rumor.\n\nAfter his death on Friday, many Chinese said he was a haunting reminder of the early steps taken to cover up the outbreak.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nStuck inside by widespread lockdowns, many people are glued to the internet, with abundant time to dwell on the doctor's death. Chinese social media, often fractious and fickle, was as unanimous as it has ever been in its grief for Dr. Li, with eulogies flowing from all corners of the country. For a few hours, a trending hashtag called for freedom of speech.\n\nUnable to fully expunge the discussions, Beijing has turned to state media to transform Dr. Li into a loyal soldier aligned with the government's cause. The tussle over the doctor's memory and the political implications are reminiscent of what happened after the SARS outbreak, some said in posts that were quickly deleted.\n\nJiang Yanyong, the retired military doctor who first called attention to widespread undercounting of SARS cases, has been erased from the official record of that time. By contrast, Zhong Nanshan, the doctor who first identified SARS, has been lionized as a faithful servant. When Beijing needed someone to publicly deliver bad news about the coronavirus, it turned to Dr. Zhong.\n\nDr. Li's death also showed how online anger can occasionally slosh over the tall censorship walls built to stifle it. China's censors have not been this overwhelmed since 2011, when anger and embarrassment over a high-speed rail accident in Wenzhou became impossible to scrub. The Wenzhou crash helped spur new policies to more tightly police the internet.\n\nWhile many of the lives lost in the coronavirus outbreak have been obscured by the numbers, Dr. Li's death has provided a face and story for the victims of the epidemic and the medical workers struggling to contain it.\n\nIn Wuhan, a steel-gray sky hung over the melancholy day of Mr. Li's death. An impromptu memorial of flowers, a black-and-white photograph and singed cigarettes -- a stand-in for joss sticks -- formed at the entrance of the hospital where he had died. The mourners during the daytime were few, perhaps because many people in Wuhan remain afraid to stray too far from home.\n\nWuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 4,500 people in China and a handful in other countries.\n\n\"Thank you for your courage,\" said the message on one bouquet of chrysanthemums, the Chinese flower of mourning. \"Heroes never die, thank you,\" said another.\n\nIn an interview with Pear Video, Dr. Li's mother spoke of her grief through sobs. For several weeks, he was stable and able to get out of bed and eat, she said, adding that only in the last two days did his condition deteriorate. She said she had not been able to see him before he died and described the shattered family he left behind.\n\n\"In June, his second child will be born,\" she said, adding that she and Dr. Li's father had both contracted the illness, but recovered. \"What happens to his family? Is it not broken?\"\n\n\"Me and his father were cured, but pitifully our child, our child didn't make it,\" she added. \"He was 34 years old. He had great potential. He was a very talented kid. He isn't like other people who lie -- he was loyal to his duties.\"\n\nCandle emojis, quotes and images of Dr. Li dominated social media feeds. Business leaders and celebrities, accustomed to muzzling political hot takes for fear of invoking the government's wrath, shared their thoughts and condolences. One popular illustration turned the outlines of Dr. Li's surgical mask into barbed wire.\n\nA part of Dr. Li's appeal has been his Everyman sensibilities. He loved fried chicken thighs, was annoyed when cherry prices rose too high and often got stuck working extra shifts at the hospital. Like many others in China, he wrote all about it online.\n\nOn the microblogging site Weibo, users surfaced his old musings.\n\n\"A life not examined is not worth living,\" he wrote in a characteristically quirky post, after musing about the origin of egg pancakes. \"I hope everyone can fulfill their values.\"\n\nThe country's state media released its own remembrances, in some cases working to subtly co-opt Dr. Li's story.\n\nChina's National Health Commission recalled him not as a Cassandra warning about the virus, but instead as a doctor on the front lines of the response. Although Dr. Li had expressed a desire to help his colleagues, he was an ophthalmologist who was sickened by a patient he was treating for glaucoma.\n\n\"Since the start of the epidemic, many medical workers disregarded their own safety, gave up their small family, and braved the difficulties for the bigger family, and fought bravely at the foremost front line of the epidemic,\" the health commission said in a statement. Those workers, it added, \"made great contributions to protect people's life and health, and we pay the utmost respect.\"\n\nChina's state-run television broadcaster sought to link Dr. Li directly to Mr. Xi's own words about the battle against the epidemic. \"Beating this devil virus is the best consolation to the deceased,\" the broadcaster said in a commentary, echoing Mr. Xi's characterization of the illness.\n\nOn Friday, bowing to popular pressure, Communist Party officials said they would send a team from the powerful anticorruption committee to investigate the circumstances surrounding Dr. Li's death.\n\nThe State Supervisory Committee has \"decided to send an investigation team to Wuhan, Hubei Province, to conduct a comprehensive investigation on related issues reported by the masses about Dr. Li Wenliang,\" it said on Friday, releasing a one-line statement on its website.\n\nIt is rare for the Communist Party to react so swiftly to public outrage. Several top officials and state media outlets had joined in the chorus mourning Dr. Li's death. In statements online, the National Health Commission and the Wuhan government said they had expressed their condolences.\n\nThe New York Times spoke to Dr. Li a week before his death. \"If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier,\" he told The Times, \"I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency.\"\n\n\"I felt I was wronged, but I had to accept it,\" he said of his arrest. \"Obviously I had been acting out of good will.\"\n\n\"I have felt very sad seeing so many people losing their loved ones.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Daniel Victor, Eimi Yamamitsu, Steven Lee Myers, Sui Lee Wee, Elaine Yu, Liz Alderman, Denise Grady, Scott Reyburn and Vivian Wang.

Warned of Coronavirus. Here's What He Told Us Before He Died.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe doctor who was among the first to warn about the coronavirus outbreak in late December -- only to be silenced by the police -- died Friday after becoming infected with the virus, the hospital treating him reported.\n\nThe death of the 34-year-old doctor, Li Wenliang, set off an outpouring of grief and anger on social media, with commenters on social media demanding an apology from the authorities to Dr. Li and his family.\n\nLast week, Elsie Chen, a Times researcher working with our correspondents Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers, interviewed Dr. Li. He caught the virus from a patient and was hospitalized when Ms. Chen interviewed him on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, via the WeChat social media platform.\n\nHere are some edited and condensed excerpts from the interview.\n\nWhen did you first realize that this new virus was highly contagious? It seemed that you hadn't taken any precautions when you were infected.\n\nI knew it when the patient I came in contact with infected her family, and I was infected right afterward. Thus I discovered it was highly contagious. The patient had no symptoms, so I got careless.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nOn Dec. 31, when you told people in the WeChat group about the SARS-like virus, did you do so because you had seen the high risk of human-to-human transmission?\n\nI suspected that, and it's always better to be cautious and take protective measures.\n\nWhy were you so suspicious at that point? Had you already received any news or heard anything?\n\nBecause there were already patients being treated under quarantine.\n\nWas that at the end of December?\n\nYes.\n\nWere there other doctors who shared the information and reminded others to protect themselves from this mysterious pneumonia?\n\nThere were discussions among our colleagues.\n\nWhat was everybody talking about? How did they evaluate the situation at that point?\n\nIt was that SARS might come back. We needed to be ready for it mentally. Take protective measures.\n\nLooking back at what has happened, do you think the situation would be very different now if the Wuhan government hadn't stopped you from warning others and sharing the information? Do you think it would have been better if the information had been more public and transparent, for the public and for doctors?\n\nIf the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency.\n\nHow did you feel when the police accused you of spreading rumors?\n\nThe police believed this virus was not confirmed to be SARS. They believed I was spreading rumors. They asked me to acknowledge that I was at fault.\n\nI felt I was being wronged, but I had to accept it. Obviously I had been acting out of good will. I felt very sad seeing so many people losing their loved ones.\n\nWhy did you decide to become a doctor? What made you proud to be one? Can you say anything about your family?\n\nI thought it was a very stable job. Lately, patient-doctor relationships have soured. I am happy as long as my patients are satisfied with their treatment.\n\nMy older child is 4 years and 10 months old. The younger one is still unborn, due in June. I miss my family.

Now, hospitals are bracing for the potential spread of coronavirus that could bring another surge of patients.\n\nSo far, only a dozen people in the United States have become infected with the novel coronavirus, but an outbreak could severely strain the nation's hospitals.\n\n\"We're talking about the possibility of a double flu pandemic,\" where a second wave starts before the first is over, said Dr. Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nPublic health experts are also closely watching reserves of vital medical supplies and medications, many of which are made in China. Some hospitals in the United States are already \"critically low\" on respirator masks, according to Premier Inc., which secures medical supplies and equipment on behalf of hospitals and health systems. And China is the dominant supplier of the raw ingredients needed for penicillin, ibuprofen and even aspirin -- drugs taken daily by millions of Americans and dispensed routinely to hospital patients.\n\n\"All the hospitals are taxed with a large flu season and other bugs,\" said Dr. Mark Jarrett, the chief quality officer for Northwell Health, which operates 23 hospitals across Long Island and elsewhere in New York. About 400 patients are coming to its emergency rooms each day with flulike symptoms.\n\n\"Everybody is at maximum capacity,\" Dr. Jarrett said.\n\nNorthwell activated its emergency operations center earlier this month in response to concerns that the virus, now in epidemic proportions across China, could become a pandemic, similar to the hospital system's reaction to the threat of swine flu in 2009 and Ebola in 2014.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration declared a public health emergency for coronavirus late last week, Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stressed on Friday at a news briefing that the risk for Americans was still low. Hundreds of people who returned to the United States from Wuhan have been quarantined at military bases, and others possibly exposed have been asked to self-quarantine or stay at home.\n\nBut Dr. Redfield also said that officials were beginning to actively discuss what other steps would have to be taken in the event that the new coronavirus spread in this country. Asked about emergency funding, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary for health and human services, said he did not believe agencies required additional funds right now.\n\nStill, across the country, hospitals are taking steps to prepare for the potential threat.\n\nSome are already scrambling to find sufficient supplies of medical face masks, especially so-called N95 respirators, which are more effective for preventing infection. Manufacturers are struggling to keep up with global demand and the desperate need for supplies in China.\n\nThe mask shortage highlights just how dependent the United States health care system is on goods from China. Premier was told last week that a Taiwanese factory it had a contract with was halting shipments to the United States. In addition, Chaun Powell, the group vice president of strategic supplier engagement for Premier, said masks that are made in China are being diverted for use there. As a result, \"there's not as much supply to ship,\" he said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nHospitals in the United States have also increased their requests, he said, adding that orders for respirator masks in the first five days of February had completely outstripped the demand for a typical month.\n\n\"We're trying to get as many masks as we can, as is everybody else,\" Dr. Jarrett of Northwell said.\n\nOn Friday, Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency was closely monitoring the supply chain from Chinese pharmaceutical and medical supply factories, but said the F.D.A. had received no reports of disruption so far.\n\nMany of those factories typically close during the Lunar New Year holidays and remained closed for additional days..\n\n\"Many of us are holding our breath to see the downstream effect on pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies because of this outbreak in China,\" said Dr. Paul Biddinger, who helps oversee emergency preparedness for Partners Healthcare, the Boston hospital group that includes Massachusetts General.\n\nExperts like Dr. Toner say supplies could easily become depleted, especially at smaller hospitals that tend to have less inventory of basic items like masks, gowns and gloves. Hospitals have long struggled with shortages of injectable medications and staples like saline. In 2017, Hurricane Maria knocked out power to several pharmaceutical factories in Puerto Rico, leading to a shortage of saline bags.\n\nHospitals will \"burn through their supplies very quickly if there are a lot of these patients,\" Dr. Toner said.\n\nSome hospital executives downplayed concerns. \"This is something we have a tremendous amount of experience with,\" said Dr. Paul Stefanacci, the chief medical officer for acute care of Universal Health Services, a for-profit hospital chain. His company has increased its orders of supplies by 10 percent to handle any uptick in patients.\n\nDavid Gillan, senior vice president of sourcing operations at Vizient, another purchasing group, described the supply chain as strained, and said he worries about too much \"anticipatory behavior,\" such as hospitals ordering more than they need.\n\nPublic health officials are also watching whether the shutdown of manufacturing plants could lead to shortages in a wide variety of drugs containing active ingredients made in China. Some drug makers reported that their facilities had reopened this week. But even temporary delays in manufacturing -- or problems transporting materials -- could lead to problems, some experts said.\n\n\"A number of companies are panicking, for sure,\" said James Bruno, a consultant who advises small and mid-size drug makers on manufacturing issues. \"Especially the smaller ones who don't have the wherewithal to have backup suppliers.\"\n\nAllen Goldberg, a spokesman for the Association for Accessible Medicines, a generic industry trade group, said companies typically have several years' worth of supplies of ingredients and that there were \"redundancies built into the system.\"\n\nRosemary Gibson, an expert on China's drug supply who is a senior adviser at the Hastings Center, a nonpartisan bioethics research institute, said she had learned of companies having trouble getting shipments of their products. \"If there were exports from China that were no longer coming to the U.S., our hospitals and our health systems would cease to function within a couple of months,\" said Ms. Gibson, who also wrote a book, \"China Rx,\" about the American dependence on medicines from China.\n\nThe United States has already seen examples of how quickly a disruption in supply from China can lead to shortages. In 2018, widespread recalls of the blood pressure drug valsartan were traced to problems at a single Chinese factory that made the drug's active ingredient, which was contaminated with a possible carcinogen.\n\nIn 2016, a chemical explosion at a raw ingredient factory in China led to a global shortage of piperacillin-tazobactam, an antibiotic used to treat a number of life-or-death conditions, including sepsis.\n\nAbout 20 F.D.A. employees assigned to the agency's offices in China, and who were responsible for product inspections there, have been evacuated.\n\n\"It will be some matter of time before we understand what the disruptions are,\" said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission who has studied the growing reliance by the United States on Chinese pharmaceutical products.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nMeanwhile, hospitals are training their staffs and circulating the latest guidance for screening patients and limiting the spread of the virus. At CommonSpirit Health -- a large Catholic hospital system with 142 hospitals created through the merger of Dignity Health, based in San Francisco, and Catholic Health Initiatives, based in Chicago -- patients and staff members are being instructed on how to distinguish coronavirus from the flu. It has already embedded screening questions in its electronic health records.\n\n\"It has not impacted our facilities at this time,\" said Roy Boukidjian, vice president for infection prevention for CommonSpirit.\n\nLearning from a 2014 experience with Ebola when two nurses in Dallas were infected while caring for a patient, hospitals understand they need to actively prepare their medical staffs for an influx of cases from a contagious disease, instructing them on how to safely put on and take off clothing and other protective equipment, said Julie Fischer, an assistant professor of microbiology at Georgetown University. \"Personnel were not trained, systems were not tested,\" she said. \"That's where the breakdown happened.\"\n\nHealth care workers are always at high risk, and the death of a doctor treating patients in China reinforced the dangers.\n\nSome nurses say they are better prepared now to protect workers. \"We all went through the Ebola virus a couple of years ago,\" said Barbara Rosen, an official with Health Professionals and Allied Employees, a New Jersey union. \"For this round, everything seems very prepared.\"\n\nBut Bonnie Castillo, the executive director of National Nurses United, t, which represents roughly 155,000 nurses, said some hospitals may not be fully prepared.\n\n\"Our concern is that there is inadequate planning and training and also just basic staffing,\" as well as the availability of supplies that protect nurses and patients from infection, she said.\n\nBecause the nature of the virus is still unknown, public health officials said it's unclear what future challenges hospitals will face if the coronavirus spreads into an epidemic in the United States. While the current government guidelines call for patients to be treated in specialized isolation rooms, experts say it is unlikely that there will be enough isolation rooms at individual facilities.\n\nAnd to manage the health of patients with severe respiratory illnesses, which coronavirus can cause, hospitals may find themselves without enough beds in their intensive care units or sufficient ventilators and other breathing equipment.\n\n\"If it's a pandemic, it's going to stretch our resources very thin,\" said Nicole Errett, a researcher at the University of Washington School of Public Health.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reed_abelson@nytimes.com", "name": "Reed Abelson", "type": "author",

"title": "Coronavirus Disrupts Travel Plans Across Asia", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn the midst of spreading fear over the coronavirus outbreak, travelers to Asia, even to countries far from the epicenter of the virus in China, are beginning to reconsider their plans.\n\nWhile hard data on cancellations is scarce, as airlines, hotels and travel boards say they do not yet have numbers or will not share them, some tour operators, travel insurance brokers and even airline employees say they are facing growing numbers of customers changing their plans.\n\nBrian Fitzgerald, president of Overseas Adventure Travel, a company providing group tours to travelers mostly over 50, said that after its initial cancellations for trips to China through April in the wake of the outbreak's announcement, this week tourists slated to go to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam were starting to reconsider as well.\n\n\"People are worried about traveling to Asia when they should be cognizant of traveling to China,\" Mr. Fitzgerald said.\n\nHe said the company had received \"almost no new bookings\" to China for the first half of the year and canceled trips. It offered about 400 travelers a full refund, the option to go elsewhere or to take the trip at a later date.\n\nThe January data for APRIL Travel Protection, an insurance provider, which tracks residents in the United States traveling to every country in the world, shows that claims with an Asian country in the itinerary more than doubled compared to January of 2019. Additionally this January, 3 percent of all the company's received claims were for cancellations related to the coronavirus.\n\nCalls to airline reservations lines also found travelers looking to cancel. Tina, a Los Angeles-based reservation receptionist for Asiana Airlines, South Korea's second largest airline, said that in the last week she'd seen calls to the center spike as much as 50 percent. She did not give her last name, citing company policy.\n\n\"They don't want to go to Asia,\" she said. \"Even though we cannot waive the fee for the Philippines or the other Southeast Asian countries, they still want to cancel.\"\n\nSimilarly, Jordan, a Philippines-based customer service agent for Singapore Airlines who did not provide his last name because of company policy, confirmed an uptick in cancellations, despite the fact that the airline has offered to reroute passengers to bypass mainland China and Hong Kong without charge.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know?

Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nThe continent of Asia has become an increasingly popular tourist destination in recent years. In 2018, more than 343 million international tourists traveled to Asia and the Pacific, according to the World Tourism Organization, an increase of 6 percent from the prior year.\n\nThe coronavirus, with its initial cases reported in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 31,000 people with more than 600 deaths reported as of Friday -- all but two deaths in mainland China.\n\nMore than 20 international carriers have suspended or restricted routes that ended in Wuhan and other major Chinese cities, including Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai.\n\nA number of airlines including China Eastern Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Air China route passengers through those cities on their way to other destinations. For some travelers, even a brief layover in China is not worth the risk.\n\nThe newlyweds Jessica Salina and her husband, Anthony, planned to honeymoon in Japan in March -- their first time traveling to Asia. But their Air China flight between Los Angeles and Tokyo included a layover in Beijing, and they decided to cancel on Jan. 30.\n\n\"My biggest fear was not Japan, but that layover in Beijing,\" Ms. Salina said in an email. \"Between the large airport and additional screenings, I was starting to full-blown panic.\"\n\nLuckily for her, the travel agency she booked through, Affordable World, provided penalty-free refunds for cancellation of flights passing through China.\n\nBut other travelers whose itineraries never touched China are choosing to cancel as well, concerned about assuming unnecessary risk for a trip that can be taken another time.\n\nJapan, now in the heat of preparations for the summer Olympics and trying to avoid an outbreak there, has focused attention on the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship that has been docked in its port city of Yokohama since last week. More than 2,000 passengers are under a two-week quarantine, as cases onboard have escalated rapidly. Up to 61 people had tested positive for coronavirus by Friday, from the 20 cases confirmed Thursday.\n\nThursday morning the Holland America Line updated its website, saying that it had been notified that the Japanese government would not allow the estimated 2,000 passengers aboard its MS Westerdam to dock in Japanese ports.\n\nThe company issued a statement: \"We are quickly working to develop alternate plans for guests currently on board and will keep them updated as information becomes available.\"\n\nThe cruise line has canceled a sailing on the Westerdam, scheduled to embark in Yokohama Feb. 15, but has announced no changes to the ship's itinerary after that time.\n\nOther cruise companies that operate in Asia declined to specify changes to their planned sailings or how many people had canceled. \"All itineraries that call in mainland China for the next six months are currently under review and we will communicate any itinerary revisions as soon as possible,\" Norwegian Cruise Line said in a statement. \"As always, we will closely monitor the situation and take appropriate action as necessary.\"\n\nKay Cuellar, deputy manager of the Los Angeles office of the Japan National Tourism Organization, noted earlier in the week that in Japan, \"all the necessary precautions are being taken\" and cautioned visitors not to overreact.\n\n\"I don't think it necessarily warrants the great concern that it's getting in the media,\" Ms. Cuellar said. \"There's no cause for that level of alarm.\"\n\nIn addition to the infected passengers aboard the Diamond Princess, Japan has another at least 25 cases.\n\nStephen England-Hall, the chief executive of Tourism New Zealand, said in an email that his country had not seen a significant impact on arrivals yet, but that even though New Zealand is more than 6,000 miles away from Wuhan: \"We expect that there will be a general softening in consumers preference to travel globally as a result.\"\n\nJason Schreier, the chief executive of APRIL Travel Protection, said the company's call center had been lit up with travelers calling to purchase policies and to better understand their current coverage.\n\nMr. Schreier said the company had received a plethora of calls from travel agents and tourists trying to determine if they would be reimbursed for canceling based on growing concern about coronavirus.\n\nThe answer in most cases was no: \"Fear of going to someplace is not unfortunately something that people can cancel for unless they have 'cancel for any reason' coverage,\" he said. That coverage is far more expensive than the standard policy.\n\nTariro Mzezewa and Shannon Sims contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

It's Close.", "body": "Wuhan Coronavirus\n\nWUHAN, China -- People desperate for treatment started descending on a new hospital that was mostly built in just 10 days to help cope with the outbreak of the new coronavirus in the central city of Wuhan on Monday.\n\nConstruction workers in hard hats, medical staff in hazmat suits, and men and women in army fatigues scrambled around the dusty site on Monday afternoon, dodging moving trucks, excavators and cranes. Workers were still trying to finish construction on the Huoshenshan Hospital -- a name that means \"Fire God Mountain\" -- even as the facility prepared to accept its first batch of patients, the official state broadcaster, China Central Television, reported.\n\nXue Ying, a resident of Wuhan, had driven to the new hospital hoping to find help for his increasingly unwell cousin. But city officials and signs on checkpoints have said the hospital would not accept walk-ins. Admission was only for patients with officially confirmed coronavirus infections who were transferred from other facilities.\n\nHere's how the hospital, built along the Zhiyin Lake, came together.\n\nConstruction teams of 7,000 workers with armies of trucks and excavators dug and scraped around the clock to complete the project. The city government is attempting a feat recalling the SARS epidemic of 2003, when Beijing built a hospital in a week.\n\nFor Beijing, the facility would also serve as a potent symbol of the government's drive to do what needs to be done.\n\nThe city government needed to build the makeshift hospital quickly using prefabricated units to ease a persistent shortage of hospital beds and medical supplies. Leaders pledged to build the 1,000-bed complex in 10 days and vowed that another new 1,600-bed hospital would be ready by Feb. 5.\n\nWuhan, a city of 11 million, has been eerily quiet since the authorities locked it down, preventing residents from leaving and severely limiting public transportation and private cars. But the roads around the hospital building site were packed with cement mixers, trucks and other construction vehicles.\n\nMany migrant workers and suppliers of materials were roped in to build the complex. Workplace safety precautions included temperature checks to try to detect signs of coronavirus infections.\n\nIn a ceremony on Sunday, Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan, officially handed the new hospital over to the military, which will be in charge of operations. Boxes containing ventilators and medical equipment lay piled on a sidewalk on Monday. Trees sat in large trucks, ready to be unloaded. One volunteer offered free rides around the vast construction site on his flatbed tricycle. On a sign, he had scrawled: \"Go, Wuhan! Go, Fire God Mountain!\"\n\nMany patients and their relatives have been eagerly looking forward to the opening of the new coronavirus hospitals, but on Monday, some were disappointed.\n\nMr. Xue, the resident who had driven to the hospital, said his mother had recently died of what the hospital called \"viral pneumonia,\" and though she was never tested, he believed that she had the coronavirus. He said his aunt and uncle were also in a hospital.\n\n\"I can't afford to lose anyone else,\" he said, sitting dejectedly in the car with his cousin, who was unwell.\n\nBy Monday evening, Chinese state media were reporting that ambulances had begun transporting patients to the new hospital.\n\nElsie Chen contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

player in Canadian soccer history, Christine Sinclair, is headed back to the Olympics at age 37. Her ticket was punched by her heir apparent, Jordyn Huitema, who is only 18.\n\nThe Canadian women's soccer team qualified for its fourth straight Olympics on Friday by beating Costa Rica, 1-0, in the semifinals of the Concacaf qualifying tournament.\n\nHuitema provided the only goal, breaking through after a feisty -- and surprisingly competitive -- first 71 minutes. Her goal was at once accidental and clinical. Meeting a driven cross from Kadeisha Buchanan in the goal mouth, Huitema calmly redirected the ball toward the left post with her left foot -- only to see it carom right back to her.\n\nAn unfazed Huitema, who made her senior national team debut as a 15-year-old in 2017, calmly met the ricochet with her right foot and slotted her second chance inside the right post.\n\nThe relief for Canada -- which is no stranger to disappointment in international play but usually breezes past Concacaf opponents other than the United States -- was palpable. Teammates mobbed Huitema, and the fight seemed to run out of the Costa Ricans.\n\nWhen the final whistle blew, Canada's substitutes raced onto the field for a round of joyful hugs. A brief postgame circle after the celebrations broke with a chant of \"1-2-3: Tokyo!\"\n\nCanada advanced to Sunday's final, where it is likely to face an old nemesis: the United States, which was to play Mexico later Friday in the second Concacaf semifinal. As with the first semifinal, the winner will advance to the Tokyo Games.\n\nThe United States is one of three countries -- along with Brazil and Sweden -- to have participated in every Olympic women's soccer tournament since the sport was added to the Summer Games program in 1996. The Americans won four golds and a silver in the first five tournaments before their stunning elimination by Sweden in the quarterfinals in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nCanada, the bronze medalist in London in 2012 and again at the Games in 2016, became the seventh nation to claim its place in the 12-team Olympic field. It joins the host, Japan; Brazil; New Zealand; and the three European qualifiers: Great Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands.\n\nThe penultimate round of Asia's qualifying tournament is currently being played in two groups, in South Korea and Australia. The latter four-team group, which includes the favorites Australia and China, was originally scheduled to play in Wuhan, China, but was moved to Australia last month because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe delegation from China arrived in Brisbane without several of its players, and was immediately quarantined in a hotel.\n\nDespite having to practice in hallways, the Chinese opened with a 6-1 victory against Thailand on Friday.\n\nThe Olympic women's tournament begins July 22, two days before the opening ceremony in Tokyo.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Outbreak\n\nAn alliance between Saudi Arabia and Russia has helped prop up oil prices for the last three years. But the two big oil producers were not in perfect harmony this week, as they have tried to recalibrate production targets to cope with reduced demand from China, whose economy has been crippled by the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nSaudi Arabia's oil minister, Abdulaziz bin Salman, wanted to move ahead quickly with a meeting to consider new production cuts, but he has struggled to persuade Moscow, even after his father, King Salman, made a call to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday.\n\nInstead, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries this week convened three long days of meetings of a technical group that produced a recommendation to cut output by 600,000 barrels, an almost 30 percent addition to curbs agreed upon in December but probably less than the Saudis wanted, according to some analysts.\n\nStill, Russia's representatives told the group that while they found the recommendations reasonable they needed more time to consider them, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n\nThe inability to reach a quick consensus inevitably raised concerns about whether Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, and Russia were still able to work together to coordinate oil policy.\n\n\"The real question is whether the Russians and the Saudis are on the same page on the necessity for collective action,\" said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank, who monitored the meeting in the OPEC press room.\n\nMs. Croft speculated that Russia might be \"slow-walking\" on cuts, though she figures that Moscow will come around in time.\n\nStill, the fact that meetings did occur, and the prospect that further cuts might be on the way, was enough to at least temporarily halt what had been a steep fall in oil prices since the outbreak of the coronavirus, which has now killed more than 600 people in China. Brent crude, the international benchmark which exceeded $70 a barrel in early January, was trading at about $55 a barrel on Friday.\n\nIn an interview, Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, head of oil market research at Rystad Energy, a research firm, said that the 600,000-barrel-a-day cut being discussed was \"quite a reasonable number.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nAs OPEC ponders what to do, it faces a difficult calculation. The degree of impact that the coronavirus outbreak will have on demand for oil is not yet known, though it is expected to be substantial. Several Chinese cities have been seemingly shut down, with some factories shuttered and flights canceled.\n\nThe curtailment of economic activity will result in a major reduction of energy consumption -- a huge concern for OPEC because China is the world's largest energy importer and a key customer. Wood Mackenzie, a market research firm, figures that oil demand for the first three months of this year will be slashed by about 900,000 barrels a day or nearly 1 percent of global consumption.\n\nThe effects of reduced energy use are already being seen in the market for liquefied natural gas, a chilled fuel used in industry and power generation.\n\nRystad Energy estimates that Chinese imports of liquefied natural gas fell 10 percent in January compared to the same month last year. Analysts say that with customers not needing as much fuel as they thought, Chinese buyers are trying to stop or reschedule shipments with some of them going to the extreme option of declaring force majeure -- a legal term for unforeseen circumstances that invalidate a contract.\n\nTotal, the French oil company, said that it recently rejected a force majeure claim by a Chinese buyer of liquified natural gas. Analysts say that the situation is likely to worsen, as vessels laden with gas are forced to go elsewhere -- all while the liquified natural gas market is already amply supplied and prices are at rock bottom.\n\n\"There is clearly a major issue in China with its ability to take L.N.G.,\" said Frank Harris, head of liquified natural gas consulting at Wood Mackenzie.\n\nIn the oil market, there are offsetting factors. The output of the Libyan oil industry is down by about one million barrels a day, or about 1 percent of world demand, because of political turmoil. While it is widely assumed that Libyan oil will come back on the market soon, no one is certain when that will be.\n\nWith the oil industry just beginning to come to terms with the implications of coronavirus, there is an argument for waiting until the next OPEC meeting, scheduled for early March, to make decisions.\n\n\"I don't know why the urgency,\" said Bill Farren-Price, director of intelligence at RS Energy group, a market research firm. \"It looks slightly panicky to me.\"\n\nWhether the split between Russia and the Saudis will widen will only become clear over time, but some analysts say that Russia has good reason to continue to coordinate policy with OPEC.\n\nAnalysts say that Mr. Putin benefits from playing along with the Saudis. Working with OPEC gives Russia a seat at the table at which many of the world's largest oil producers negotiate output decisions that have an impact on prices.\n\nTies to the Saudis also fit with Mr. Putin's efforts to expand Russia's influence in the Middle East in countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya. A web of business relationships is forming between Russian companies and Riyadh and its allies like Abu Dhabi, where Lukoil recently became the first Russian firm to gain participation in natural gas production.\n\nThe Russians \"seem to be content to be part of this coalition and maintain this political role even if their implementation of cuts is very limited,\" Mr. Farren-Price said.",

York: Second Possible Case in City Is Identified", "body": "Wuhan Coronavirus\n\nA day after New York City's health authorities said that a woman hospitalized at Bellevue Hospital Center might have the new coronavirus, the authorities on Sunday announced that a second patient might have the virus.\n\nSamples from both patients -- the first is a woman under 40, and the other, whose gender is not known, is described as being older than 60 -- are being sent for testing to a laboratory in Atlanta that is run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe turnaround time for the results is usually at least 36 hours, but often longer.\n\nFor more than a week, New York City has been bracing for the arrival of the new coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, as isolated cases began to appear elsewhere in the country.\n\nIn both suspected cases in New York, the individuals had recently been in China and came down with flulike symptoms. Both had been tested for influenza and a number of other common illnesses, and those tests came back negative.\n\nFor now, the local health authorities lack the ability to test for the new coronavirus.\n\nThe first patient has been described as a woman who was staying alone in a hotel in New York City. She fell ill about two days after arriving in the United States. Late Friday night, she was brought by ambulance to Bellevue Medical Center on Manhattan's East Side with a fever, cough and runny nose.\n\nShe was the first patient in New York City to have samples sent to the C.D.C. for testing. The city's public health authorities announced her case on Saturday evening and had been referring to her as \"a patient under investigation.\" The authorities have cautioned that she may be found not to have the new virus.\n\nThe second patient, whose case was announced Sunday evening by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, is currently at Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens.\n\nHealth authorities in New York City have been reluctant to share much detail about either patient, including exactly where they had been in China. Both have been described only as having recently been in \"mainland China.\"\n\nThere are eight confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the United States and more than 14,000 worldwide.\n\nOver the last two weeks, the Health Department in New York City has sought to reassure the public and encourage people to continue with their daily routine. Those who recently traveled from China and even Wuhan were told that there was no need to self-quarantine so long as they felt fine and were symptom-free.\n\nHowever, the federal government recently imposed further restrictions with a new quarantine policy that went into effect at 5 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nThat policy bars most foreign nationals who have had contact with mainland China in the past 14 days from entering the United States. And American citizens who have been to Hubei province will be taken into mandatory quarantine upon entry into the United States, or directly to a hospital if they are found to be \"symptomatic,\" Rick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said on Sunday. The Port Authority operates Kennedy International, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports.\n\nAmerican citizens who are returning from elsewhere in China will be instructed to self-monitor their health and will be \"subject to restrictions on movements outside their homes,\" Mr. Cotton said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_goldstein@nytimes.com", "name": "Joseph Goldstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_(Manhattan)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Side (Manhattan)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Department_of_Health_and_Mental_Hygiene", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flushing, Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Flushing, Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaGuardia_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LaGuardia Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Authority_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port Authority of New York and New Jersey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Esta semana, el Ministerio de Seguridad P\u00fablica de China elogi\u00f3 dichos esfuerzos que han continuado incluso despu\u00e9s de que una persona que fue reprendida por difundir rumores result\u00f3 ser un m\u00e9dico que alertaba sobre los primeros casos de la enfermedad.\n\nEl gobierno chino ha modificado su estrategia para el control de informaci\u00f3n en respuesta a la naturaleza cambiante del descontento del p\u00fablico, afirm\u00f3 King-wa Fu, profesor adjunto en el Centro de Estudios de Periodismo y Comunicaci\u00f3n de la Universidad de Hong Kong.\n\nDurante los primeros d\u00edas de la crisis, las fuertes cr\u00edticas en l\u00ednea estuvieron dirigidas en su mayor\u00eda a las autoridades locales. Ahora, gran parte de la molestia se enfoca en el liderazgo de alto nivel y parece que en general ha aumentado, coment\u00f3.\n\nPor ejemplo, a finales del mes pasado, despu\u00e9s de que The New England Journal of Medicine public\u00f3 un ensayo de investigaci\u00f3n acerca de los primeros casos del virus, los usuarios de internet en China se aprovecharon del hecho de que muchos de los autores trabajaban para el Centro Chino de Control y Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades, para afirmar que su trabajo era informar al p\u00fablico y no promover sus carreras como investigadores.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\n\"Ahora entiendo\", escribi\u00f3 una persona en la plataforma de la red social Weibo. \"Todo este tiempo, el prop\u00f3sito del CCDC (por su sigla en ingl\u00e9s) fue publicar art\u00edculos de investigaci\u00f3n\".\n\n\"El enojo me ha dejado sin palabras\", escribi\u00f3 otra.\n\nM\u00e1s tarde, los investigadores afirmaron que toda su informaci\u00f3n sobre las infecciones se hab\u00eda hecho p\u00fablica antes de la redacci\u00f3n del ensayo.\n\nA estas alturas, dijo Fu, un incremento en la censura \"no detendr\u00eda la frustraci\u00f3n p\u00fablica\".\n\nEl r\u00e1pido aumento en la cantidad de infecciones y fallecimientos a causa del virus ha puesto m\u00e1s presi\u00f3n en el liderazgo de alto rango en China. Los hospitales que se encuentran cerca del centro de la epidemia han superado su capacidad y las personas con s\u00edntomas parecidos a los de la gripe han sido rechazadas. Muchos casos no han sido diagnosticados a causa de la escasez de equipos de prueba.\n\nNo obstante, la cantidad de personas que se est\u00e1n recuperando en China tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 aumentando. El mi\u00e9rcoles 5 de febrero, un importante experto en salud le atribuy\u00f3 el gran incremento en el n\u00famero de casos confirmados al hecho de que los hospitales han podido diagnosticar el virus con mayor rapidez. La cantidad de casos sospechosos ha disminuido por la misma raz\u00f3n, coment\u00f3 el experto Li Xingwang, en un reporte noticioso oficial.\n\nAl parecer, las nuevas restricciones a la informaci\u00f3n se pusieron en pr\u00e1ctica a principios de esta semana, cuando el dirigente de China, Xi Jinping y otros oficiales de alto rango afirmaron en una reuni\u00f3n que \"endurecer\u00edan el control sobre los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n en l\u00ednea\" como una de varias medidas para conservar la estabilidad social.\n\nLos dirigentes afirmaron que los esfuerzos de la propaganda del gobierno deben enfocarse en \"transmitir claramente los emocionantes logros en las l\u00edneas de combate de la prevenci\u00f3n de la epidemia\" y en \"mostrar la unidad y el esp\u00edritu del pueblo chino para salir adelante juntos en tiempos dif\u00edciles\", de acuerdo con Xinhua, la agencia oficial de noticias.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de la reuni\u00f3n, un funcionario de alto rango del departamento central de propaganda de China le coment\u00f3 a la cadena Televisi\u00f3n Central de China (CCTV, por su sigla en ingl\u00e9s) que su departamento despach\u00f3 a m\u00e1s de 300 periodistas a la l\u00ednea de batalla de la epidemia en Wuhan y su provincia circundante, Hubei.\n\nEl funcionario, Zhang Xiaoguo, afirm\u00f3 que el objetivo del departamento era hacer de la campa\u00f1a de control y prevenci\u00f3n su \"m\u00e1xima prioridad\".\n\nNo qued\u00f3 claro si entre los 300 periodistas se incluye a los que ya estaban reportando desde Hubei o si son reci\u00e9n llegados. Tampoco se especific\u00f3 a qu\u00e9 organizaciones de noticias representan. El departamento de propaganda no respondi\u00f3 a un fax donde se solicitaba alg\u00fan comentario.\n\nEl esfuerzo fue recibido con sarcasmo en redes sociales.\n\n\"Al fin llega la energ\u00eda positiva\", escribi\u00f3 un usuario en Weibo, usando el t\u00e9rmino que usa el gobierno chino para referirse al tono acr\u00edtico y entusiasta que le gusta ver en la prensa.\n\nLa publicaci\u00f3n tuvo m\u00e1s de 27.000 'me gusta'. Pero todos los comentarios en la publicaci\u00f3n fueron finalmente borrados y despu\u00e9s se bloquearon los comentarios.\n\nEsta semana, trabajadores de organizaciones de noticias chinas hablaron de un cambio obligatorio en el tono de sus narraciones y nuevas \u00f3rdenes de apegarse a la l\u00ednea oficial.\n\nPor ejemplo, a los periodistas de la agencia de noticias Xinhua se les ha indicado que mantengan un tono positivo durante sus coberturas del virus, de acuerdo con instrucciones internas a las que The New York Times tuvo acceso. Se les orden\u00f3 no seguir mencionando que la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud ha declarado una emergencia de salud internacional y no dar cobertura a todas las infecciones descubiertas en el extranjero.\n\n\"Cubran \u00fanicamente lo necesario\", dec\u00eda en las instrucciones.\n\nEn el resto del paisaje noticioso de China, los art\u00edculos con un amplio rango de temas han sido bloqueados o borrados en l\u00ednea en d\u00edas recientes.\n\nEntre ellos se encuentra un reporte publicado en la revista de noticias financieras Caijing acerca de las muertes en Wuhan que podr\u00edan no estar incluidas en la cifra oficial; un informe de primera mano de una agencia funeraria en Wuhan; e incluso una entrevista con el director de una famosa cadena de restaurantes que afirm\u00f3 que, si no se contiene el virus, en unos meses se le podr\u00eda acabar el efectivo.\n\nPek\u00edn est\u00e1 emprendiendo acciones para controlar su manejo de la epidemia a medida que los gobiernos en todo el mundo siguen distanci\u00e1ndose de China para detener la entrada de casos de coronavirus.\n\nHong Kong, territorio chino semiaut\u00f3nomo, declar\u00f3 el mi\u00e9rcoles 5 de febrero que comenzar\u00e1 a solicitarles a todas las personas que lleguen desde el territorio continental de China que se sometan a una cuarentena de 14 d\u00edas. Hong Kong tiene 21 casos confirmados de coronavirus, incluyendo tres que se transmitieron localmente.\n\nCarrie Lam, funcionaria de m\u00e1s alto rango de la ciudad, se ha opuesto a las solicitudes de algunos legisladores y trabajadores de la salud de cerrar la frontera por completo, describiendo la medida como discriminatoria y en discrepancia con las directrices de la OMS. No obstante, Lam ha puesto en marcha una serie de medidas, incluyendo el cierre de todas las fronteras a excepci\u00f3n de tres, lo que ha tenido como resultado una ca\u00edda pronunciada en las entradas desde el territorio continental.\n\nEstados Unidos y otros pa\u00edses tambi\u00e9n han impuesto restricciones de entrada a visitantes provenientes de China. Dichas medidas han trastornado la industria tur\u00edstica mundial.\n\nEl ministro de relaciones exteriores de Italia Luigi Di Maio se\u00f1al\u00f3 en una entrevista con The Associated Press que la prohibici\u00f3n impuesta por Italia el 30 de enero a los vuelos comerciales provenientes de China y hacia ese destino podr\u00eda disminuir ahora que se est\u00e1n instalando esc\u00e1neres t\u00e9rmicos en los aeropuertos de todo el pa\u00eds y que se est\u00e1 tomando la temperatura de los pasajeros que llegan de todos los vuelos del extranjero.\n\nCathay Pacific, la aerol\u00ednea internacional con sede en Hong Kong, les ha pedido a sus 27.000 trabajadores que se tomen tres semanas de descanso sin goce de sueldo. La empresa de transportes ya ha reducido casi todos sus vuelos procedentes y con destino a China continental y ha dicho que reducir\u00e1 los vuelos en su red, pues enfrenta su mayor emergencia desde la crisis financiera de 2009.\n\nNueve pasajeros y un miembro de la tripulaci\u00f3n de un crucero con 2666 pasajeros y 1045 miembros de la tripulaci\u00f3n que est\u00e1n en cuarentena en Yokohama, Jap\u00f3n, han dado resultados positivos en la prueba del coronavirus, de acuerdo con lo que afirm\u00f3 el mi\u00e9rcoles 5 de febrero la empresa de cruceros Princess Cruises.\n\nLa embarcaci\u00f3n lleg\u00f3 el martes 4 de febrero a Yokohama, pero las autoridades no permitieron que nadie desembarcara. Se descubri\u00f3 que un habitante de Hong Kong, de 80 a\u00f1os, que hab\u00eda desembarcado previamente en su ciudad natal, estaba infectado.\n\nEl mi\u00e9rcoles, cientos de estadounidenses que hab\u00edan estado en Wuhan mientras el brote empeoraba llegaron a California en dos vuelos de evacuaci\u00f3n organizados por el gobierno estadounidense. Ese mismo d\u00eda se confirm\u00f3 el d\u00e9cimo segundo caso de coronavirus en Estados Unidos.\n\nAustin Ramzy, Elaine Yu y Alexandra Stevenson colaboraron con este reportaje desde Hong Kong y Sui Lee Wee desde Singapur.

by Virus Raise Risks to Global Growth", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nFRANKFURT -- Chinese car and car-parts factories may stay closed longer than expected because of the coronavirus, increasing the chances that assembly lines in Asia, Europe and the United States could grind to a halt because of shortages of components.\n\nThe hit to the auto industry, which employs eight million people worldwide, comes at a time when output from the world's factories is already sagging. It is likely to amplify the already alarming human and economic cost of the outbreak.\n\nMany automakers had planned to reopen their Chinese factories on Monday, which was already a week later than planned following the traditional Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nBut several companies including BMW, PSA and Toyota have delayed restarting their assembly lines another week and others appear likely to. Even a relatively brief interruption in the flow of parts and materials could have far-reaching effects, analysts said.\n\n\"Two weeks is probably the buffer most people have got,\" Mark Fulthorpe, a director at the market researcher IHS Markit who follows the auto industry, said Friday. \"A disruption in the supply chain can multiply and have a dramatic effect.\"\n\nThe shutdowns at Chinese factories hit automakers from several angles. The virus is already causing them to lose sales in China, the world's largest car market by far. If they are forced to shut down factories outside of China because of parts shortages, as Hyundai has already done in South Korea, they could also lose sales in other regions.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nBecause the auto industry is so vast, its pain would spread throughout the global economy. And it is hardly the only industry at risk from supply chain problems. Others include computers and electronics, textiles and heavy machinery.\n\nEvery week that Chinese factories remain shuttered subtracts $26 billion from world trade, according to an estimate by Ana Boata, head of macroeconomic research at Euler Hermes.\n\nSome of those sales will be recouped after the virus subsides, but \"we doubt the global economy is strong enough to catch up entirely,\" Ms. Boata said in a note to clients Friday.\n\nThe disruption to the car industry is most intense in Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei, which is home to many auto parts suppliers.\n\nPSA, the French maker of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars, said its three car factories in Wuhan, the center of the epidemic in China, would remain closed until Feb. 14.\n\nThe virus has also interrupted production far from Wuhan. The German carmaker BMW, which has three factories in Shenyang, in northern China, has suspended production until Feb. 17.\n\nToyota said it would not resume full production at its four car and eight component factories in China until Feb. 17, a week later than planned. The Japanese carmaker said it was keeping an eye on potential problems outside China, but \"there is currently no impact.\"\n\nNone of the carmakers can restart operations until they receive government permission to do so.\n\nDaimler and Volkswagen, which also have large operations in China, said Friday they could not comment on whether their factories would reopen on Monday as planned. Given that the virus does not appear to be under control yet, the risk of a longer shutdown appeared to be high.\n\nThe German economy is especially vulnerable to any economic slowdown in China. A decline in the Chinese growth rate of 1 percentage point would strip 0.6 percentage points from German growth, the Ifo Institute in Munich estimated. That is in part because German factories are so dependent on components made in China.\n\nGrowth in the European Union is already close to zero. The coronavirus could be enough to shove the region into recession.\n\n\"The rapid spread of the coronavirus throughout China is quickly becoming a major source of uncertainty for the economy,\" economists at ING Bank said in a note to clients.\n\nThe longer it takes to contain the virus, the greater the risk that factories outside of China could begin to fall idle. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles warned Thursday that a plant in Europe, which it declined to identify, was in danger of running short of a critical component.\n\n\"If the situation in China continues to worsen, FCA has identified potential risk within the next two to four weeks at one manufacturing facility in Europe,\" the company said in a statement. The company \"will continue to monitor the situation and continues to develop contingency plans.\"\n\nMr. Fulthorpe of IHS Markit said it could be difficult for companies to quickly find substitute suppliers.\n\nEven the lack of a small, seemingly insignificant part can cause a factory floor to go quiet.

Race to Contain America's First Coronavirus Case", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nEVERETT, Wash. -- It started with a stubborn cough. A visit to an urgent care facility. A test being sent off to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And then a 35-year-old resident of Snohomish County, Wash., being named the first confirmed case of the coronavirus in the United States.\n\nHollianne Bruce, the lone epidemiologist assigned to the control of communicable diseases in the county's public health office, jumped into action. Declining to wait for a C.D.C. team to arrive from Atlanta, she dialed up the patient, who had been taken to an isolation unit at a hospital.\n\nSeeking to establish a rapport, Ms. Bruce told him she knew he was not feeling well. She apologized for the disturbance. But she impressed on him how he might help save lives by sharing where he had been in recent days and with whom he had come into contact.\n\n\"We don't know a lot about this virus,\" she told him. \"We'd like to ask you some questions.\"\n\nThe man, who had been taken to the hospital the night before in a covered gurney intended for Ebola patients, agreed to help. It would be the first of several conversations he would have with Ms. Bruce, some by phone, others over a walkie-talkie as she stood outside his sealed room. Once, at his request, she bought him lunch at a nearby Panda Express.\n\nIn their conversations, she took him back six days, when he had returned from visiting family in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nCould he tell her the dates of his travel? His flight number? His seat number?\n\nHow had he returned home from the airport? When did his symptoms start? Where did he work? Did he stop anywhere on the way to work? Did he stop on the way home? Had he gone out for any meals?\n\nFor Ms. Bruce, it was a relief to learn that the patient lived alone, that he took the stairs rather than the elevator to his office, and that he did not work in an open cubicle.\n\nBut he had attended a group lunch the day he developed a cough, and all eight of his lunch partners would be tracked down. Once he developed a cough, he had walked into a crowded health clinic. Thirty-eight other people who were in the clinic that day would need to be monitored.\n\nThe coronavirus, which has killed hundreds of people in China and sickened more than 20,000 in countries across the world, has been declared a global health emergency. To slow its spread, the Trump administration has invoked a rarely used constitutional power to impose a quarantine on Americans returning from the area around Wuhan.\n\nBut within the United States, containing the virus is a local responsibility. Across the country, where at least 10 more cases have since been confirmed, it is health officials at the county and municipal level who are scrambling to isolate the sick, learn where they have been and monitor those who have come into contact with them. Health workers are also debunking rumors, calming fears and bracing for the expected emergence of new cases.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak How Is the U.S. Being Affected?\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nEleven cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the United States, including a 35-year-old man in Washington State, a couple in their 60s in Chicago and six people in California. If you live in California, here's what this means for you. Two new planeloads of Americans evacuated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, arrived on military bases, where they were expected to remain in quarantine for days. Hundreds of Americans who recently traveled to China are isolating themselves in 'self quarantines' for 14 days. How one man's cough brought confirmation of America's first case and the race to contain it. A high school exchange student may have been among the last Americans to arrive home in time to avoid the mandated quarantine. Mask hoarders may increase the risk of an outbreak in the U.S. Health care workers risk infection if they cannot get the protective gear. Most experts agree: To protect yourself wash your hands and avoid touching your face. Affected by travel? Or do you know someone who is? Please contact us at coronavirus@nytimes.com if you are willing to be contacted by a reporter or have your comments used for a coming story.\n\nAt the Snohomish Health District, the staff of 113 has poured 1,000 hours into coronavirus control since the patient's test was sent to the C.D.C. over the Martin Luther King's Birthday weekend. Food inspectors, human resource managers and opioid outreach specialists have pitched in.\n\n\"All responses are local,\" said Dr. Satish Pillai, an infectious disease specialist who headed an eight-person team that was dispatched from C.D.C. headquarters in Atlanta to monitor the case. \"What happened in Snohomish is emblematic of what we need to evolve and improve our ability to respond to a virus we are seeing for the very first time in the United States.\"\n\nAn account of the last two weeks at the Snohomish Health District -- whose offices are festooned with messages like \"Immunizations: They're your best defense!\" and \"Save A Life: Give Your Blood\" -- offers a look at what may be in store for more of the nation's 3,000 local health jurisdictions in the weeks to come.\n\nDelivering a Thermometer\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus still seemed far away on the evening of Jan. 19 when Dr. Chris Spitters, the district's interim health officer, was alerted that a local clinic had sent specimens to the C.D.C. from a resident who had recently returned from Wuhan.\n\n\"In the first moments you kind of want to deny that this is happening,\" Dr. Spitters recalled.\n\nDr. Spitters, who was out of town for the holiday weekend, asked Katie Curtis, the district's assistant director of prevention services, to check on the man, who had agreed to remain isolated at home until the test results came back.\n\nHis symptoms were relatively mild. But health officials wanted to monitor him for fever and to make sure he had any supplies he might need so he did not need to leave his house.\n\nHe had plenty of food, the man told Ms. Curtis on the phone, but no thermometer.\n\nWhen Ms. Curtis knocked on his door the next morning after picking up a thermometer at a pharmacy, he answered wearing a face mask. He promised to text her his temperature every few hours.\n\nHis first text came a few minutes later.\n\nIt was no cause for alarm.\n\nBut before the next one, Ms. Curtis called him with Dr. Spitters on the line. By then, a team of nurses and emergency medical technicians had been assembled. The simulation they had performed earlier in January on how to transport and quarantine a highly infectious patient was suddenly becoming reality. An isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center, meant for Ebola patients and never before used, was in the process of being erected.\n\n\"We have your test results,\" Ms. Curtis told the patient.\n\n'Can I Cure It With a Lime?'\n\nThe reactions among the dozens of people potentially exposed to the patient ranged from anxiety to irritation. Some expressed gratitude to Ms. Bruce and the other health workers who reached out to them. There were several jokes about Corona beer.\n\n\"Can I cure it with a lime?\" one wanted to know.\n\nOnly one person earned the notation \"resistant to public health intervention.\"\n\nEveryone on Ms. Bruce's \"close contact\" list received two phone calls from a public health worker to impress upon them the seriousness of the situation. They were required to take their temperatures twice a day and report any fevers or coughs. After that, they could opt to receive a text message, carefully worded so as not to raise alarm should another person see it.\n\n\"This is the Health District with your daily symptom check for your household,\" it read. \"Please reply with 1 if you have no symptoms, reply with 2 if someone in your household is ill.\"\n\nAcross the county line, Ms. Bruce's counterparts in King County were performing the same task with dozens of others who worked with the patient, were on his flight or rode with him from the airport. At least nine people who were exposed to the patient have developed symptoms that fell within the C.D.C.'s criteria for testing. Results for three of them are still pending; the others were negative.\n\nA 'Person Under Investigation' Breaks Quarantine\n\nIn many ways, the coronavirus response was familiar ground for the local health workers, who routinely labor to prevent and control outbreaks of gastroenteritis, measles, tuberculosis and H.I.V.\n\nThe novel nature of the coronavirus added urgency -- and a disquieting uncertainty -- to the work. Who is most at risk? How soon do symptoms arise in people who are infected? How, exactly, is the virus transmitted?\n\nDuring a season when nearly everyone has a sore throat, it was hard to know who among the contacts they were tracing needed to be tested and given the \"PUI\" designation, for \"person under investigation.\"\n\nThose who were ordered to stay in their homes were taken care of. The groceries that the Seattle and King County public health department delivered to one prospective patient included hair conditioner, blueberries and 2 percent milk.\n\nStill, when Ms. Bruce could not reach one of the people she was monitoring over the weekend of Jan. 25, she grew alarmed. After leaving a message with the woman's emergency contact, she received a call at home that night. The woman explained that she had been in the process of moving to Wisconsin, and that she had taken her flight as planned.\n\n\"You did what?\" Ms. Bruce asked. The woman has subsequently tested negative.\n\nAccusations of a cover-up\n\nThe people of Snohomish County had questions.\n\nWhy had local health officials not released the name of the clinic where the patient had received care?\n\nWas this all a government scheme to sell vaccines? Was it safe to take children to the airport? Was the rumor at a local high school that a student had tested positive for the virus true?\n\nThere was no reason to believe, health officials told residents, that the patient had posed a risk to people with whom he had not been in reasonably close contact. To disclose the clinic location could create a false sense of panic, officials said.\n\nThere was no government scheme, officials made clear. They had tested no minors for the coronavirus, they said of the school rumors. And as for the airport, they said parents should encourage their children to wash their hands.\n\nBut it was hard for officials to keep up with the anxiety.\n\n\"This is an evolving situation,\" reads a post on the health office's Facebook page.\n\nSeeking a Normal Life Again\n\nCarrie Parker, the outreach and preparedness supervisor for the Snohomish Health District, took on the role of \"incident commander\" over the last two weeks. On Tuesday, she told her 30-person team that they might soon be returning to their day jobs.\n\nThe Snohomish County patient has been discharged from the hospital with instructions from Dr. Spitters to remain in isolation at home for now. Snohomish health officials declined to release his name, and his identity could not be determined.\n\nIn a statement, the man said he was continuing to get better and he thanked those who had cared for him. He expressed a desire to return to his normal life and \"not to be in the public eye.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Now, as the coronavirus renders his home city a ghost town, overwhelming hospitals and forcing his friends and family to don masks in their own homes, Mr. Zhang is updated constantly despite living over 7,000 miles away, in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"I might be finding things out faster than my parents,\" he said, describing a steady stream of videos, photographs and reports from his friends in Wuhan, even information about specific apartments in specific buildings where the coronavirus has apparently struck.\n\nIt's a small world after all, a frightening thought if the virus becomes a global pandemic, but a mixed blessing for the scores of Wuhan natives living in Pittsburgh, which has been a \"sister city\" of Wuhan for nearly 40 years.\n\nThe designation does not mean much officially, beyond the creation of some local partnerships and occasional delegation visits, where ideas about economics and bike-share plans are exchanged. But it does provoke some extra urgency to help out on the part of city leaders in Pittsburgh, who have offered assistance, and certainly on the part of people from Wuhan like Mr. Zhang, 28, who works for an online retailer of prescription eyeglasses. Along with several groups in the city, he helped set up an online fund-raiser for critical medical supplies that has raised nearly $50,000.\n\nWuhan is a much bigger city than Pittsburgh, but the two bear a certain resemblance; in an interview, Mayor Bill Peduto of Pittsburgh called Wuhan a \"postindustrial city that has created a new economy based upon technology and medicine.\" Both are former steel cities at the confluence of major rivers, and as Pittsburgh had decades ago, Wuhan has recently taken on the heavy task of cleaning up and reinventing itself.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak How Is the U.S. Being Affected?\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nTwelve cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the United States, including a 35-year-old man in Washington State, a couple in their 60s in Chicago and six people in California. If you live in California, here's what this means for you. Two new planeloads of Americans evacuated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, arrived on military bases, where they were expected to remain in quarantine for days. Hundreds of Americans who recently traveled to China are isolating themselves in 'self quarantines' for 14 days. There was a race to contain the disease after one man's cough became confirmation of America's first case. A high school exchange student may have been among the last Americans to arrive home in time to avoid the mandated quarantine. Mask hoarders may increase the risk of an outbreak in the U.S. Health care workers risk infection if they cannot get the protective gear. Most experts agree: To protect yourself wash your hands and avoid touching your face. Affected by travel? Or do you know someone who is? Please contact us at coronavirus@nytimes.com if you are willing to be contacted by a reporter or have your comments used for a coming story.\n\nPeople from Wuhan began settling in Pittsburgh, a city of about 300,000, in the late 1980s. They stay in touch with one another in a WeChat group and formally get together twice a year to talk and eat -- particularly the hometown favorite, hot dry noodles. The number of Pittsburghers who hail from Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, is said by some to be around two or three hundred.\n\n\"I was surprised how big a group there was from Hubei province,\" said Dr. Jing He, a neuroscience researcher who grew up near Wuhan and arrived in Pittsburgh two and a half years ago.\n\nLike Wuhan, Pittsburgh is a big college and university city. There are nearly 3,000 Chinese students at Carnegie Mellon University, an engineering powerhouse, and nearly 1,900 Chinese students at the University of Pittsburgh, 53 of them from Hubei province. For years, graduate students from Wuhan University taught Chinese at an institute on Pitt's campus, though that program was suspended last summer because of visa issues with the State Department.\n\nMany students from Wuhan are in the medical field, often ending up at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a regional health care giant. They were particularly well-prepared to act after hearing the news from home in January.\n\n\"We told friends and classmates, 'Hey, we heard there's a problem there,' but they said, 'Everything is normal,'\" said Xiaoming Li, an engineer who grew up in Wuhan but has lived in Pittsburgh for 26 years. That was early on, when people thought the sickness was confined to customers and vendors at a local meat market.\n\nBut suddenly the government declared that the virus could be spread by human-to-human contact and sealed off Wuhan, a city of 11 million. What became a matter of concern immediately became a mass emergency. Natives of Wuhan in Pittsburgh, many of whom are friends with the doctors now in Wuhan hospitals, heard dire reports.\n\n\"They are short of medical supplies, short of doctors, nurses, short of everything,\" Mr. Li said.\n\nDr. He heard the same things -- when he heard from people at all. \"It's very, very scary,\" he said. \"My classmate works at a hospital in Wuhan. I try and try to reach my friend but she doesn't reply. I assume she is overwhelmed with all the patients.\"\n\nStill, this was the advantage of many of those from Wuhan now in Pittsburgh: They personally know the medical professionals who need the masks, gloves and other supplies, so they can send them directly rather than relying on third parties like the Red Cross. A first shipment has already gone out.\n\nFund-raising continues -- the owners of the city's Chinese restaurants raised a few thousand dollars at their annual Lunar New Year party -- but the challenge now is finding enough supplies to buy. Organizers of the fund-raiser said American suppliers were reluctant to sell large amounts in case of an outbreak in the United States, where 11 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed as of Tuesday evening.\n\nThey understand this reluctance: Their other priority is, obviously, to keep the disease from gaining any foothold here. Volunteers within the Chinese community are bringing groceries to people who have returned from China recently and are secluding themselves in voluntary self-quarantine, as institutions around the city are urging.\n\nSo far, there are no confirmed cases in Pittsburgh. Mr. Zhang has his hands full as it is.\n\n\"There's already an outbreak in my hometown,\" he said. \"I don't want another.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

coronavirus provoca que los fabricantes de cubrebocas trabajen a marchas forzadas", "body": "ANGERS, Francia -- El zumbido incesante de las m\u00e1quinas haciendo eco a trav\u00e9s del piso de una cavernosa f\u00e1brica francesa esta semana es el resultado inesperado del virus mortal que pr\u00e1cticamente ha paralizado ciudades enteras en China y en otras partes de Asia. Y es que la f\u00e1brica es de una empresa, Kolmi Hopen, que produce un art\u00edculo que repentinamente se ha convertido en uno de los m\u00e1s solicitados en el mundo: el cubrebocas quir\u00fargico.\n\nLa f\u00e1brica, que se encuentra en Angers, por lo general fabrica alrededor de 170 millones de cubrebocas quir\u00fargicos anualmente, pero en la \u00faltima semana ha recibido pedidos por la asombrosa cantidad de 500 millones, lo que satur\u00f3 los buzones del departamento de venta con un pedido cada minuto o dos. Kolmi Hopen se est\u00e1 apresurando a contratar a m\u00e1s trabajadores para mantener las m\u00e1quinas funcionando las veinticuatro horas del d\u00eda, los siete d\u00edas de la semana.\n\n\"Fabricamos cubrebocas tan r\u00e1pido como podemos\", dijo Guillaume Laverdure -- gerente general de la matriz de Kolmi Hopen, Medicom, con sede en Canad\u00e1 -- , mientras los conductores de los montacargas transportaban cajas de cubrebocas reci\u00e9n fabricados a los camiones.\n\n\"Pero la demanda sigue en aumento\", agreg\u00f3.\n\nEl brote de coronavirus ha desatado una carrera por conseguir mascarillas protectoras en toda China y en ciudades grandes. Para frenar la propagaci\u00f3n del virus, el gobierno chino ha ordenado a sus ciudadanos llevar cubrebocas cada vez que salen. Algunos profesionales de la salud afirmaron que, una vez que se usa uno, se debe remplazar por otro nuevo, lo cual ha generado una explosi\u00f3n en la demanda. Se han vuelto habituales las escenas l\u00fagubres de personas haciendo fila durante horas para obtener un protector para el rostro y que al final deben marcharse porque las farmacias ya no tienen.\n\n\"No logro encontrar un solo cubrebocas\", dijo Sandy Lo, de 60 a\u00f1os, en Hong Kong. \"Ya no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 tiendas tienen existencias\". Dijo que ella reutiliza los cubrebocas \"porque, \u00bfqu\u00e9 m\u00e1s podr\u00eda hacer?\".\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de los cubrebocas de todo el mundo se fabrican en China y Taiw\u00e1n, pero las f\u00e1bricas de esos lugares, incluyendo aquellas dirigidas por Medicom, han sido obligadas a detener sus exportaciones temporalmente para cumplir con las exigencias del gobierno de reservarlos para sus habitantes.\n\nEl 3 de febrero, el gobierno chino, reconociendo que se necesitaban cubrebocas quir\u00fargicos y otro equipo protector de manera urgente, asegur\u00f3 que comenzar\u00eda a importarlos de Europa, Jap\u00f3n y Estados Unidos para ayudar a compensar el desabasto.\n\nEsto ha convertido a la f\u00e1brica de Kolmi Hopen en el oeste de Francia en un punto crucial ins\u00f3lito. Los tel\u00e9fonos de la f\u00e1brica no han parado de sonar conforme los compradores de suministros m\u00e9dicos exploran todo el mundo en busca de fabricantes de cubrebocas.\n\nLa demanda de mascarillas respiratorias de alta filtraci\u00f3n es especialmente grande, pues pueden ser m\u00e1s efectivas que los cubrebocas quir\u00fargicos para combatir la propagaci\u00f3n de gotas min\u00fasculas llenas de virus, coment\u00f3 Laverdure. Otra f\u00e1brica de Medicom que manufactura cubrebocas, en Augusta, Estados Unidos, tambi\u00e9n ha aumentado su producci\u00f3n. Laverdure se neg\u00f3 a hablar de detalles financieros, incluido el costo de las mascarillas.\n\nAlgunos cient\u00edficos afirmaron que no hay muchas pruebas de que los cubrebocas realmente protejan a personas sanas (lavarse las manos podr\u00eda ser m\u00e1s importante). Aun as\u00ed, conforme el coronavirus se propaga -- ya hay miles de casos confirmados y cientos de muertes -- , los expertos temen que el suministro de cubrebocas y otros art\u00edculos de protecci\u00f3n sanitaria comiencen a agotarse en otros pa\u00edses; incluso para su uso en procedimientos m\u00e9dicos de rutina. Las farmacias en Estados Unidos han comenzado a reportar escasez.\n\nEl frenes\u00ed de los pedidos en Kolmi Hopen pone en evidencia la perturbaci\u00f3n a gran escala que puede provocar China en la cadena de suministro mundial, incluso para los productos m\u00e1s especializados, si las f\u00e1bricas chinas no logran funcionar a su m\u00e1xima capacidad.\n\nTan solo China produce aproximadamente la mitad de las mascarillas sanitarias del mundo, cerca de 20 millones diarias o m\u00e1s de 7000 millones al a\u00f1o, para suministrar a hospitales y trabajadores m\u00e9dicos en muchos pa\u00edses. Taiw\u00e1n aporta el 20 por ciento del suministro mundial.\n\nLa producci\u00f3n de cubrebocas ya hab\u00eda disminuido, pues las f\u00e1bricas chinas hab\u00edan desacelerado su producci\u00f3n por los festejos del A\u00f1o Nuevo lunar a principios de enero. Algunas f\u00e1bricas cerca de Wuhan, el epicentro del brote de coronavirus, todav\u00eda no restablecen por completo la producci\u00f3n y est\u00e1n operando al 60 por ciento de su capacidad, de acuerdo con el gobierno.\n\nLa f\u00e1brica de Medicom en Wuhan, que elabora batas quir\u00fargicas, se encuentra entre las que han retrasado su reapertura. La sucursal de la empresa que fabrica cubrebocas en Taiw\u00e1n ya no tiene permitido exportar. Adem\u00e1s, el gobierno envi\u00f3 supervisores a la f\u00e1brica de Medicom en Shangh\u00e1i, y est\u00e1 requisando los tres millones de cubrebocas que se producen al d\u00eda inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de que salen de la l\u00ednea de producci\u00f3n, coment\u00f3 Laverdure.\n\nLa falta de suministro podr\u00eda empeorar debido a que las piezas para las mascarillas y los respiradores se fabrican en distintos pa\u00edses. M\u00e1s del 90 por ciento de los cubrebocas quir\u00fargicos que se venden en Estados Unidos se producen en el extranjero, de acuerdo con el Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos. Algunas piezas, o en ocasiones el ensamblaje final, podr\u00edan producirse o realizarse no solo en China y Taiw\u00e1n, sino tambi\u00e9n en Jap\u00f3n, Vietnam, M\u00e9xico y Colombia.\n\n\"Estos pa\u00edses podr\u00edan cortar nuestra cadena de producci\u00f3n con facilidad\", coment\u00f3 Laurie Garrett, una experta en pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas y periodista ganadora del Pultizer que ha escrito acerca del SARS, el \u00e9bola y otros brotes.\n\nConforme el suministro de China para el mundo comienza a escasear, los proveedores m\u00e9dicos de todo el mundo, incluyendo gigantes de la industria como Honeywell y 3M, est\u00e1n considerando fuentes alternativas. A trav\u00e9s de sus representantes, ambas empresas aseguraron que est\u00e1n experimentando un aumento en la demanda y que est\u00e1n emprendiendo acciones para aumentar la producci\u00f3n en todos los lugares posibles.\n\nEsta semana, algunos funcionarios de Medicom dieron a conocer un plan de emergencia para la f\u00e1brica de Angers con el objetivo de sumar treinta trabajadores a los cien que conforman su personal, y est\u00e1n considerado una producci\u00f3n ininterrumpida. La empresa est\u00e1 fabricando m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de cubrebocas al d\u00eda, el doble de su producci\u00f3n habitual, dijo Laverdure.\n\nM\u00e1s de una decena de m\u00e1quinas de la f\u00e1brica ensamblaron m\u00e1scaras a una velocidad de 80 por minuto: mezclaban fibras sint\u00e9ticas y estampaban cada una con tiras nasales, cintas para la cabeza o para las orejas. Cinco m\u00e1quinas fabricaban m\u00e1scaras quir\u00fargicas, las finas almohadillas rectangulares que cubren la nariz y la boca, mientras que otras m\u00e1quinas confeccionaban los cubrebocas m\u00e1s resistentes.\n\nCuatro trabajadores, incluidos dos reci\u00e9n llegados que comenzaron su entrenamiento esta semana, inspeccionaron un lote de codiciadas mascarillas y las apilaron en cajas que luego fueron trasladadas al almac\u00e9n para ser enviadas a Hong Kong y otros destinos.\n\n\"Cuando vimos que algunas ciudades en China fueron aisladas, el gobierno cancel\u00f3 las festividades del A\u00f1o Nuevo lunar y se detuvieron las exportaciones de m\u00e1scaras\", dijo Laverdure, \"llamamos a nuestras f\u00e1bricas y advertimos: 'Se est\u00e1 desarrollando una epidemia. Hagan lo que puedan para asegurar una mayor producci\u00f3n'\".\n\nA medida que el gobierno de China se movi\u00f3 para crear campamentos masivos de cuarentena cerca del epicentro del brote, la compa\u00f1\u00eda se prepar\u00f3 para un ritmo m\u00e1s acelerado.\n\n\"La demanda no se detiene\", dijo Laverdure. \"La situaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 evolucionando muy r\u00e1pido\".\n\nLiz Alderman es la corresponsal principal de negocios en Europa.

negative, city health officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe woman, who had been at Bellevue Medical Center since Friday night, was one of three patients recently hospitalized in the city who doctors thought might have the virus, which emerged in China late last year before spreading to at least two dozen countries.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the negative results for the woman's samples to city authorities on Tuesday, officials said. Samples from the other two patients who may have the virus have been sent to the C.D.C., and the results are pending, officials said.\n\n\"We're relieved to hear that the person in question does not have the novel coronavirus,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. \"I can't say this enough: If you have the symptoms and recent travel history, please see your health provider immediately.\"\n\nThere has yet to be a confirmed case of the new illness in New York City or anywhere in New York State.\n\nAs of Monday, 11 people in the United States had been found to have the illness, according to the C.D.C. Of the 11, the only patient on the East Coast to have tested positive was in Massachusetts.\n\nThe new virus is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year before spreading widely. The Chinese government has reported 20,438 confirmed cases, and the death toll in China had passed 420 deaths as of Tuesday.\n\nFor now, local authorities in the United States cannot test for the virus and must send samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta. It can take several days to get results.\n\nNew York City officials have said that the three patients whose samples were sent to the C.D.C. had all traveled recently from China; had a fever and cough or shortness of breath; and had tested negative for influenza and a number of other common illnesses.\n\nThe woman who tested negative for the new coronavirus is said to be under 40. She was visiting New York and began to feel ill about two days after arriving in the United States. An ambulance brought her from the hotel where she was staying to Bellevue, the flagship of the city's public hospital system, late on Friday.\n\n\"The response and care the patient received reflects how well the systems we have in place are working,\" said Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the city's health commissioner.\n\nThe two other patients whose samples were sent to the C.D.C. have been described as over 60. Both were hospitalized last weekend in Flushing, Queens.\n\nThe authorities in New York have said they are ready for the illness, and that sooner or later it is bound to arrive.\n\n\"Whatever happens internationally, it winds up at our doorstep relatively quickly,\" Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said at a news conference on Sunday.\n\nCoronaviruses have been behind other dangerous outbreaks in recent decades: SARS in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, which was first reported in 2012.\n\nThe new coronavirus appears to be less lethal than SARS or MERS, but it is spreading more quickly. Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the C.D.C.

an immigration detention center on Australia's Christmas Island has not been as bad as David Huang feared. It is certainly a far cry from the conditions that thousands of asylum seekers have faced in the country's offshore detention centers in recent years.\n\nSure, the steel on the building's facade is rusted in parts. The Wi-Fi is shaky, especially at meal times when he and others are trying to contact their families and friends. Dinner, at least on Tuesday, the first night he spent there, was uninspiring and mushy.\n\nYet after being evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, he had set his expectations low.\n\nMr. Huang, a 22-year-old student from Sydney, is one of about 270 Australian citizens and permanent residents who have been flown out of China in the past week and taken to Christmas Island. None of the evacuees have tested positive for the virus, Australia's health minister said on Tuesday.\n\nHealth experts have criticized the government's decision to quarantine them for two weeks in a center usually used to house asylum seekers rather than holding the evacuees in better-equipped military bases on the mainland. But while some evacuees have said the conditions at the center are worse than they had imagined, Mr. Huang said he personally found the quarantine bearable.\n\nAlthough he said the travelers had found dead moths in their beds and dead cockroaches on the floors, and spent much of their first night in the center cleaning, Mr. Huang said he didn't really mind.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\n\"It's obviously not great for the rooms to have dirty conditions,\" he said by telephone. \"But I think its important to think about the fact that there are so many families here that they have to accommodate.\"\n\nWorkers at the center have been responsive to the evacuees' requests, Mr. Huang said. They added more fruit and vegetables to the meals, handed out soap and cigarettes, as well as sunscreen, shorts and sandals -- attire more suited to the tropical island than the clothes they had brought from China. There are Xbox 360 gaming devices, which some of the evacuees were playing to pass the time.\n\nThose in the quarantine have been given wrist bands with QR codes that, when scanned, provide access to their medical records. And every day, doctors wearing face masks and full protective medical gear take their temperatures.\n\nFamilies are split into two people per room. Mr. Huang and his father are staying in one room, while his mother and brother are staying in another. The rooms have bunk beds and a desk. Showers and toilets are shared.\n\nFor Mr. Huang and his family, their journey began on Sunday in the city of Xiangyang in Hubei Province, about three hours away from Wuhan, the Chinese city hardest hit by the virus. They had been visiting relatives during the Lunar New Year holiday last month when the authorities locked down Xiangyang as part of a security cordon to contain the epidemic.\n\nWhen the family decided to leave, they made a series of phone calls to Chinese and Australian officials and received documents that allowed them to drive through multiple checkpoints to Wuhan's airport. The flight first landed on Learmonth, an air base in Western Australia. Passengers were then transferred on separate flights to Christmas Island.\n\nThere, Mr. Huang, who is worried about contracting the virus, has mostly kept to himself.\n\nEach day after waking up, he goes for a walk outside the building, which is surrounded by tall fences. After breakfast and a medical check, Mr. Huang, who is studying game development, returns to his room, where he plays computer games for a few hours. Then he goes for another walk to check his social media accounts. To pass the time, his mother has been teaching him how to read and write Chinese characters.\n\n\"And repeat,\" he said. \"That's what my daily schedule looks like.\"\n\nMr. Huang said the hardest thing to deal with was the sense of isolation on an unfamiliar island, and he misses his friends in Sydney.\n\n\"Very, very homesick, I think describes both my family and the families around us,\" he wrote on Facebook Messenger shortly before the internet seemed to drop out once more.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

'Keep Out' Sign for Immigrants", "body": "The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.\n\nOn Friday, with Americans focused on President Trump's impeachment trial, the coronavirus and the upcoming Iowa caucuses, the Trump administration announced it was adding six more countries to the list of those whose citizens face travel restrictions to the United States. The given reason was that those nations were not sufficiently screening people who sought to come to America.\n\nThe six countries affected when the travel ban takes effect on Feb. 22 are Sudan, Tanzania, Eritrea, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria. All have sizable, if not majority, Muslim populations -- in Myanmar's case, Muslims are a minority that is severely repressed. According to the acting secretary of homeland security, Chad Wolf, these countries fell short in new vetting criteria for \"terrorists and criminals attempting to enter the United States.\"\n\nThe restrictions differ -- Sudan and Tanzania are barred from the \"diversity visa\" lottery, while the other countries face a suspension of entry for immigrants. Travel for tourism and reasons other than immigration remains open -- a curious gap if the purpose of the restrictions is to keep out potential terrorists.\n\nIt may be that the countries do somehow fall short in vetting would-be emigrants. And since the conservative-controlled Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump's ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries -- Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad (later removed from the list) -- as well as Venezuela and North Korea in June 2018, the new ban would most likely survive legal challenge. But it doesn't take a lot of intuition to guess that security is not foremost on the president's mind.\n\nBlocking the immigration of people of color, Muslims or non-English speakers has been among the most frequent of Mr. Trump's pitches to his base, and the timing for a new ban was propitious. It was the third anniversary of his first travel ban, the impeachment drama was sputtering to an end and the starting gun for the 2020 election season was about to go off in Iowa (or, as it happened, to pathetically misfire). With all the Democratic candidates opposed to Mr. Trump's immigration policies, what better time to remind his followers that Mr. Trump was still standing guard at the gates?\n\nYet the latest ban makes as little sense as the first one, and it stands to do far more harm than good. A 2018 study by the libertarian Cato Institute found that the Trump administration's \"extreme vetting\" of travelers and immigrants, of which the travel ban is a centerpiece, would not significantly reduce the already minuscule risk of imported terrorism achieved by visa reforms after 9/11, but would come at exponentially greater cost. The risk of any American being killed in the United States by a refugee or immigrant is negligible, Cato found.\n\nApart from the cruelty of barring thousands of family reunifications, the new restrictions could actually hurt the American economy. The ban is certain to strain relations with the newly listed countries. Five of them, including Nigeria, which has Africa's largest economy, are being avidly courted by China as part of its \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" and could well conclude that China is a more trustworthy and predictable partner than the United States.\n\nAdding ignorance to insult, Mr. Trump has consistently misrepresented the diversity lottery program, from which he is now excluding Sudan and Tanzania, as a means for poor countries to dump people they don't want on the United States. In fact, the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program is administered by the State Department to increase immigration from countries with low rates of immigration, and candidates must have at least the equivalent of a high school diploma or two years of work experience to qualify.\n\nThe veneer of process and rationale over the latest travel ban cannot conceal its fundamental malice.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Blaming a Parts Shortage, to Shut Down Some Production", "body": "The Coronavirus Crisis\n\nHyundai, the world's fifth-largest carmaker, announced Tuesday that it was suspending production lines at its car factories in South Korea, one of the first major manufacturers to face severe supply-chain issues because of the coronavirus.\n\nHyundai has already been hamstrung because it relies on auto parts from China. The Chinese economy has slowed as the country deals with the deadly coronavirus, which has killed more than 420 people and continues to spread through the population.\n\nThe company said in a statement that it had \"decided to suspend its production lines from operating at its plants in Korea. The decision is due to disruptions in the supply of parts resulting from the coronavirus outbreak in China.\"\n\nMany auto plants in China have already shut down because of the virus, including factories run by Hyundai, Tesla, Ford and Nissan. Hyundai plants in South Korea would be the first to shut down lines outside of China, and comes as Hyundai has ramped up production in China over the past two decades.\n\n\"The company is reviewing various measures to minimize the disruption of its operations, including seeking alternative suppliers in other regions,\" a Hyundai spokesman said in an email. The company said suspension schedules would vary by line.\n\nHyundai and its affiliated automaker, Kia, produced 7.2 million cars last year. Hyundai has a worldwide network of factories, including plants in Russia, Turkey, the Czech Republic and Montgomery, Ala., which can probably make up for lost production in Korea.\n\nBut the shutdown of some production at its Korean plants may signal further disruptions at manufacturers that depend on parts from China. The longer that Chinese factories remain shut down, the greater the risk of shortages of key components.\n\nHyundai sold more than four million vehicles last year, most of them in China and the United States.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geneva_abdul@nytimes.com", "name": "Geneva Abdul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kia Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nissan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical_Intermediates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical Intermediates", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "eventUri": "eng-5485805", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 23}, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 23, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1435774399", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-05", "time": "05:38:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-05T05:38:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-05T05:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html", "title": "Coronavirus Live Updates: Deaths in China Rise, With No Sign of Slowdown", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak Here's what you need to know:As deaths approach 500, no sign of a slowdown in China.Looking for the basics? Start here.A second evacuation of Americans from Wuhan has begun.After traveling to China, some Americans are staying indoors.10 passengers on a cruise ship in Japan tested positive for the virus.Hyundai suspended production at South Korea car factories.As deaths approach 500, no sign of a slowdown in China.\n\nThe death toll from the monthlong coronavirus outbreak has continued to climb in China, rising to 490. New cases have surged by double-digit percentages in the past 11 days, with no sign of a slowdown.\n\nMore people have now died in this epidemic than in the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, outbreak of 2002-3 in mainland China. During that outbreak, 349 people died in the mainland.\n\nThe new figures from China's Health Commission on Wednesday showed that 65 people died on Tuesday and that 3,887 more people had been infected. So far, 24,324 people are known to have been infected.\n\nHealth experts say the death toll is likely to rise because of the large number of infections. The mortality rate of the coronavirus, about 2 percent so far, appears to be far lower than SARS, which has a mortality rate of about 10 percent.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 24,400 people in China and 24 other countries.\n\nExperts warn they still lack enough data to say definitively how lethal the new coronavirus is. Many residents in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak and the capital of Hubei Province, believe the death toll is much higher than the official tally because people with flulike symptoms are being turned away by overstretched hospitals. The health care system in Wuhan is so overwhelmed that many cases have not been diagnosed because of a shortage of testing kits.\n\nThe number of people in China recovering from the virus is also rising, suggesting that the treatment plan is working. On Tuesday, 262 people left hospitals nationwide. The number of suspected cases has dropped for two days in a row. Officials said they were tracking 3,971 suspected cases, compared with 5,173 cases the day before.\n\nOn Tuesday, health officials released details of the deaths so far, saying that two-thirds of them were men. More than 80 percent were over 60 years old, and they typically had pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases or diabetes.\n\nHubei Province has been hardest hit by the virus, and is home to the bulk of deaths (479) and infections (16,678). Wuhan in particular has borne the brunt of the deaths and infections.\n\nThe government said it has put 252,154 people under surveillance.\n\nLooking for the basics? Start here.\n\nWhat is a coronavirus, and how dangerous is it? Read up on the basics, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted.\n\nHow bad could the outbreak be? Here are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained.\n\nWhere has the virus spread? You can track its movement with this map.\n\nHow is the United States being affected? There were 11 confirmed cases as of Tuesday. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine.\n\nWhat if I'm traveling? Several countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings.\n\nHow do I keep myself and others safe? Washing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nA second evacuation of Americans from Wuhan has begun.\n\nThe United States has begun its second airlift of American citizens out of China.\n\n\"Two planes have departed Wuhan en route to the United States,\" the State Department said in a statement Wednesday night.\n\nLittle information was immediately available on the planes' destination.\n\nBut it was believed that like the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, the passengers will be taken to a military base and directed to remain there pending medical tests.\n\nThe first evacuees were flown from Wuhan on Jan. 29, and their plane stopped in Anchorage to refuel and for the passengers to be given initial screenings. The Boeing 747 then continued on to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, Calif.\n\nAfter traveling to China, some Americans are staying indoors.\n\nAs United States officials impose new restrictions on travelers from China, many people who have returned to the country in recent days have hunkered down in their homes to make sure they were not carrying or spreading the disease.\n\nSome were checking in regularly with local public health departments, taking their temperatures at regular intervals and receiving deliveries of food and water. Others were not conferring with the authorities, but choosing on their own to stay indoors, away from work, away from friends and, in some cases, away from everyone.\n\nAll were counting down the days since they left China, waiting anxiously to see if symptoms develop -- and whether they can get their lives back to normal.\n\n\"It's pretty scary,\" said a woman in Massachusetts whose husband and 18-month-old son have been holed up in the family's basement since returning from China last week.\n\nThe woman, a medical researcher who asked not to be named, said her family's self-imposed quarantine was a necessary step to protect others, especially since she feared her family had traveled on the same flight as a man who was later diagnosed with coronavirus.\n\n\"If people are responsible people,\" she said, \"they are willing to do this.\"\n\n10 passengers on a cruise ship in Japan tested positive for the virus.\n\nTen passengers on a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama, Japan, have tested positive for the coronavirus, Japan's health minister said on Wednesday.\n\nThe ship, carrying about 3,700 people, arrived in Yokohama on Tuesday, but the authorities did not allow anyone off. An 80-year-old Hong Kong resident who had disembarked earlier in his home city was found to be infected.\n\nIn all, 273 passengers were tested for the virus after everyone on board underwent an initial health screening. Twenty-one people were cleared, and officials were awaiting the other results.\n\nThe passengers who tested positive were being transported by a Japanese Coast Guard ship to a hospital. The other passengers are to remain quarantined on board the Princess Cruises ship, the Diamond Princess.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the American military, which has a large presence in Japan, said that anyone under its jurisdiction who was returning to the country from China would undergo a 14-day quarantine.\n\nHyundai suspended production at South Korea car factories.\n\nHyundai, the world's fifth-largest carmaker, has said that it was suspending production lines at its car factories in South Korea, one of the first major manufacturers to face severe supply chain issues because of the coronavirus.\n\nHyundai, which relies on auto parts from China, said in a statement on Tuesday that it had \"decided to suspend its production lines from operating at its plants in Korea.\"\n\n\"The decision is due to disruptions in the supply of parts resulting from the coronavirus outbreak in China,\" it added.\n\nMany auto plants in China have shut down because of the virus, including factories run by Hyundai, Tesla, Ford and Nissan.

the Coronavirus: When Is Breakfast?", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nTOKYO -- Hidden away in her cabin, Masako Ishida reckons she doesn't face much risk from the coronavirus that has stalked her cruise ship, forcing an onboard quarantine of 3,700 passengers and crew members in the port city of Yokohama.\n\nMs. Ishida, 61, is trying to see the bright side as she faces two long weeks stuck inside the ship. She has a window to gaze out of, unlike some passengers. She, like her two traveling companions -- her husband and her mother, both in their 80s -- is healthy and not in need of any medications.\n\nBy no means, though, is this going to be easy.\n\nConfusion arrived quickly. Ms. Ishida said she first learned that her two-week cruise might be extended not from the crew, but from an article she read online on Monday. That report said a man from Hong Kong who had disembarked from the ship, the Diamond Princess, in his home city on Jan. 25 had tested positive for the virus.\n\nWhen she asked some crew members about it, they confirmed the news, she said. But it took a while for other passengers to learn that they might have been exposed to the virus, which has killed hundreds in China.\n\n\"There wasn't much information,\" Ms. Ishida said from the ship on Wednesday during a call via Facebook.\n\nThe Diamond Princess, which has 13 decks and offers entertainment like movies under the stars and live musical productions, arrived in Yokohama on Monday night and stayed at anchor for two days while the authorities decided what to do.\n\nJapanese health workers have begun screening 273 people who displayed symptoms or came into contact with the infected man. So far, 10 of them, including passengers from Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and the United States, have been found to be infected. They were being taken to hospitals.\n\nAll 3,700 people on board received an initial health screening. Ms. Ishida said the authorities who performed it didn't seem to take it very seriously.\n\nWhen they first took her husband's temperature, she said, the reading was 32 degrees Celsius, or 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit, well below a normal temperature of 98.6.\n\nMs. Ishida asked them to retake it. The second reading was 35 degrees Celsius, or 95 Fahrenheit.\n\n\"They didn't put the thermometer into our ears properly,\" Ms. Ishida said.\n\nShe has also felt the chaos of the sudden quarantine at mealtimes. Breakfast, delivered by staff members in goggles and masks, didn't arrive until almost 2 p.m. Then lunch came right on its heels.\n\nNevertheless, the crew members are \"serving guests with a smile,\" Ms. Ishida said. \"That's giving us some peace of mind.\"\n\nThe ship is steaming back out to sea so it can empty its bilge and supplement its water supplies, its owner, Princess Cruises, said on its website. It will return to port on Thursday to take on food and other supplies.\n\nMs. Ishida and her family enjoy cruises and had been especially looking forward to relaxing aboard the Diamond Princess as it wended its way from Yokohama to Kagoshima, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan and Okinawa.\n\nNow, instead of taking a dip in the freshwater pools or going on a \"Chocolate Journey,\" Ms. Ishida and her family are whiling away their time playing games on their tablets, reading, watching movies and speaking to family and friends using the ship's now-free Wi-Fi.\n\nJudging by social media, other passengers trapped on board have had more difficult moments.\n\nIn a Facebook video, David Abel, a passenger from Britain, said on Wednesday morning that he was concerned about how the quarantine might affect his diabetes, saying that he had not eaten in many hours and was fearful that he could fall into a coma.\n\nThe problem was resolved, he said, after staff members aboard the ship responded to a flood of emails expressing concern about his condition.\n\nEarlier that morning, he had been more optimistic. As an announcement about the quarantine came over a loudspeaker, Mr. Abel said that the passengers would be confined to their cabins and that he was looking forward to the free time.\n\n\"Most of my day will be spent writing and researching and so on,\" he said, adding, \"What my bar bill is going to be, goodness only knows.\"\n\nFor Ms. Ishida, her biggest worry is about the toll that being stranded on board for such a long time will take on her family.\n\nStill, things could be worse. The last time she went on a cruise, she said, everyone caught the flu.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Coronavirus\n\nChina's Communist Party leadership called the month-old coronavirus epidemic a \"major test\" on Monday as other nations escalated efforts to isolate China, unnerving China's stock market, depressing global oil prices and raising new anxiety about the world's most populous country.\n\nThe growing global move to effectively cut off China's 1.4 billion people came as government officials reported the new coronavirus strain had killed more in mainland China than the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, confirming it as one of the deadliest epidemics in recent Chinese history.\n\nMany leading infectious disease experts say the outbreak is likely to become a pandemic, defined as an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents, and that stringent anti-contagion restrictions may have come too late.\n\n\"There's no sign that it's getting better,\" said Leo Poon, division head of the public health laboratory sciences department at the University of Hong Kong. \"We don't see a pattern of decline, and that's a problem.\"\n\nWith the official count of the dead rising to 361, President Xi Jinping of China called on Monday for all officials to make reducing the number of infections and deaths a top priority.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 17,300 people in China and 23 other countries.\n\nMr. Xi presided over a meeting of senior Communist Party leaders at which they acknowledged shortcomings in policies on public health and emergency management, according to a report by China's official news agency. The leaders called the coronavirus epidemic \"a major test of China's system and capacity for governance.\"\n\nXinhua quoted Mr. Xi as saying that officials who resist orders and \"lack boldness\" could be punished -- suggesting that at least some regions in China may have balked at devoting resources and personnel to stopping the contagion.\n\nChina had 17,205 confirmed infections as of Sunday, and more than 160 cases have been diagnosed in two dozen other countries, including 11 in the United States. During the SARS outbreak, China had 349 deaths and 5,327 cases, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nGovernment figures show that confirmed coronavirus infections are surging by more than 2,000 daily.\n\nSome deaths still go unreported, and many residents in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak in central Hubei Province, say they believe the true number of deaths across China may be higher than the official tally, because many of the ill have been turned away by overstretched hospitals. Several residents said they had heard of people dying at home.\n\nThe commonly accepted need for isolating suspected cases collided with anger, confusion and recrimination between China and other governments.\n\nIn the United States, there were scenes of uncertainty at the few airports still permitted to receive flights from China, as the first federally required quarantine since the smallpox era a half century ago took effect.\n\nRussia, which shares a 2,600-mile border with China, suspended all passenger-rail links. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte exhorted citizens to \"stop this xenophobia thing\" amid signs there were acts of discrimination against people of Chinese descent.\n\nThe government of Hong Kong, the autonomous territory that is part of China, closed four border crossings to the Chinese mainland, leaving just three, as more than 2,400 Hong Kong medical workers went on strike to press for a total ban on mainland arrivals.\n\nMany airlines have suspended flights to China, and governments have barred Chinese travelers or anyone who has traveled recently to China, despite the World Health Organization's statement that the closure of international borders was unnecessary. The United States has recommended that Americans put off travel to China.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, criticized the American response, adding that, \"the U.S. government has not provided any substantive help to the Chinese side yet.\"\n\nIn an online news briefing, Ms. Hua noted that the United States was \"the first to withdraw its consulate staff from Wuhan, the first to suggest the partial withdrawal of embassy staff and the first to announce a ban on entry by Chinese citizens.\"\n\n\"What the U.S. has done could create and spread panic,\" Ms. Hua said.\n\nBut in China itself, millions of people who were working in Hubei Province have been stopped from returning to their home areas, feared as potential carriers of the disease and treated as outcasts. Even those without symptoms are being ostracized.\n\nLast week, the American health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, said that he had offered to send a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to China to help with the coronavirus outbreak, adding that he had reiterated the offer several times.\n\nWith the C.D.C. already running through its allocations for emergency response funds, the Department of Health and Human Services informed Congress that it may transfer up to $136 million to help combat the spread of coronavirus, according to a person with knowledge of the notification.\n\nEven as Chinese officials tried to reassure their own public that shortages of medical supplies were being addressed, and that food prices were stable, the spillover effects of China's isolation reverberated through the Chinese stock market, which had been closed since Jan. 23 for the Lunar New Year holiday. Investors confronting the prospect that the world's No. 2 economy could suffer severe constraints sent stock prices tumbling by 8 percent.\n\nIn a note to clients, Tai Hui, J.P. Morgan's chief market strategist in Asia, wrote that, \"As the number of infections is still likely to rise in the weeks ahead, we would expect the Chinese onshore equity market to come under pressure.\"\n\nThe anxiety also infected global energy markets, where the possibility of falling demand from a hobbled China -- the world's biggest importer of oil -- sent prices to the lowest level in more than a year. Ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as Russia, agreed to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday about possible production cuts.\n\nIn Wuhan, ailing residents have been begging for beds at local hospitals. Overwhelmed doctors have run out of medical supplies. In response, the Wuhan government announced that two new hospitals were to be built within weeks. The first hospital, with 1,000 beds, opened Monday after it was built in just eight days.\n\nIt was unclear whether the daily surge in infections is at least partly a result of more test kits being delivered, making it hard to determine how fast the virus is spreading. But even as the death toll has risen, the number of people who have recovered has also climbed in recent days, suggesting that the fatality rate of the virus is relatively low.\n\nThe Chinese National Health Commission reported on Sunday that there had been 475 recoveries. In Hubei, 80 patients were pronounced recovered on Sunday, while 56 died that day. On Saturday, 49 patients were released from hospitals, and 45 died.\n\nChina has sealed off several of its cities, including Wuhan, restricted public gatherings and quarantined some communities. Many cities have been brought to a virtual standstill as residents have been told to stay at home and schools and offices remain shut.\n\nAlthough many Chinese cities have extended the Lunar New Year holiday to combat the spread of the disease, public health experts say the virus is still likely to spread, given how infectious it is and the large number of travelers expected to commute for work.\n\nThe geographical extent of the disease is reminiscent of that of SARS, with cases reported in at least 25 countries, amplifying fears that the virus could spread across the world.\n\nReporting was contributed Austin Ramzy, Alexandra Stevenson, Steven Lee Myers, Chris Buckley, Amy Qin, Anton Troianovski, Paul Mozur, Vivian Wang, Emily Cochrane, Tess Felder, Jason

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/briefing/coronavirus-iowa-caucuses-kansas-city-chiefs.html", "title": "Your Monday Briefing", "body": "Good morning.\n\nWe're covering the latest updates in the coronavirus outbreak and the Chiefs' 31-20 win over the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV. We're also looking ahead to tonight's Iowa caucuses.\n\nCoronavirus prompts fears of a pandemic\n\nThe virus that has spread from China around the world appears to be readily transmitted between humans, but infectious disease experts are uncertain how lethal it will be.\n\nThe virus has killed more than 360 people in China, a toll that exceeds the one during an outbreak of SARS in the country in the early 2000s. SARS had a mortality rate of 9.6 percent, but only about 2 percent of those reported to have been infected with the new coronavirus have died. Here are the latest updates.\n\nThe details: In the past three weeks, the number of confirmed cases has soared from about 50 in China to more than 17,000 in at least 23 countries, including the U.S. and Canada. Our maps track the spread.\n\nCloser look: Wuhan, the city of 11 million where the outbreak originated, is now under a virtual lockdown. Our correspondent there reports that residents are finding it nearly impossible to get the care they need.\n\nAnother angle: Stocks in Asia fell today in response to the outbreak. As China has evolved into a principal element of the global economy, the epidemic represents a potent threat.\n\nWhat's at stake in Iowa\n\nHistory and mathematics suggest that no more than four of the Democratic candidates will emerge from tonight's caucuses with a plausible case to be the party's presidential nominee.\n\nWe'll have live election results starting at 8 p.m. Eastern. Here's what to watch for and a primer on how Iowa's first-in-the-nation nominating contest works.\n\nA Times polling average found Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden tied for first place in the state, which has an imperfect record of predicting a party's eventual nominee. Our correspondent in Des Moines reports on the final weekend of campaigning.\n\nGo deeper: Iowa's outsize role in the presidential race has been criticized because the state is more white and more rural than most of the U.S. But it does mirror the nation's economy and demographics in an important way: its aging population.\n\nThe Daily: In today's episode, we asked caucusgoers how they felt about the election.\n\nFinal stages of the impeachment trial\n\nThe Senate will reconvene today at 11 a.m. Eastern for up to four hours of closing arguments, divided equally between impeachment managers and President Trump's lawyers.\n\nThe proceedings come after Republicans last week blocked Democrats' efforts to call additional witnesses and evidence.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly stressed that he did nothing wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, but several Republican senators on Sunday stressed a more nuanced argument: The president's actions were inappropriate, but they didn't merit his removal from office.\n\nWhat's next: Senators will be allowed to make floor speeches on the articles of impeachment on Tuesday, before Mr. Trump delivers his State of the Union address that evening. The trial will conclude on Wednesday with a vote that is expected to acquit the president.\n\nAnother angle: With impeachment all but behind him, Mr. Trump spent a celebratory weekend at Mar-a-Lago, where he was focused on potential election opponents, particularly Michael Bloomberg.\n\nA stunning Super Bowl comeback\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter to come from behind and beat the San Francisco 49ers, 31-20, in Super Bowl LIV on Sunday. It was the Chiefs' first championship since the 1969 season.\n\nKansas City's 24-year-old quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, became the youngest player to be named the Super Bowl's most valuable player.\n\nThe halftime show: Jennifer Lopez and Shakira led a performance that was heavy on hip-shaking Latin pride. Read our music critic's review.\n\nThe ads: With a heavy dose of nostalgia mixed with sentimentality, the 80-plus commercials during TV's biggest advertising day generally avoided divisive issues.\n\nIf you have 15 minutes, this is worth itMisogyny at Victoria's Secret\n\nThe billionaire Leslie Wexner bought Victoria's Secret in 1982, and turned it into a lingerie powerhouse with annual fashion shows that became a global cultural phenomenon.\n\nBut the company had a secret of its own: a degrading work environment where women were objectified and complaints of sexual harassment were buried, a Times investigation found.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nExpanding travel ban: The Trump administration has extended immigration limits to six countries, including four in Africa. The ban will affect nearly a quarter of the 1.2 billion people on the African continent, according to one estimate.\n\nSubway's clash of egos: Even as New York City's transit system emerged from a crisis, a feud grew between its leader, Andy Byford, and his boss, Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Our reporter explains the background of the dispute, which led to Mr. Byford's resignation.\n\nSnapshot: Above, volunteer firefighters in Australia last week. The country has relied heavily on civilians during the recent wildfires, but for individuals on the front lines, the pressure to be a hero can be overwhelming. Read more from our bureau chief in Sydney.\n\nOverlooked no more: Homer Plessy helped challenge segregation in 1890s New Orleans, and his case of civil disobedience later prompted one of the most notorious rulings in the Supreme Court's history. He's the latest entry in our series about people who didn't receive obituaries in The Times.\n\nMetropolitan Diary: In this week's column, splitting up, finding a car key and more reader tales of New York City.\n\nWhat we're listening to: The \"Best Known Method\" podcast. Our health reporter Anahad O'Connor welcomed its return for a second season. \"Greatly enjoyed this discussion with Professor Emily Oster,\" he tweeted, \"especially now that I'm a dad and can benefit from her parenting insights.\"\n\nNow, a break from the news\n\nCook: Lemony shrimp and bean stew is a quick, easy Monday dinner.\n\nWatch: \"1917\" and \"Parasite\" were the big winners at the BAFTAs, Britain's equivalent of the Oscars, but the lack of diversity among the nominees dominated the ceremony on Sunday.\n\nRead: Coming-of-age stories and a Supreme Court drama are among 14 books to watch for this month.\n\nSmarter Living: Our Social Q's column offers advice to a woman who finds her husband's nieces and nephews \"unruly, unintelligent and uninteresting.\"\n\nAnd now for the Back Story on ...Britain's big moment\n\nThe yearslong exit from the European Union happened at midnight Friday in Brussels, which is 11 p.m. in Britain itself. (They're in different time zones.)\n\nOur London correspondent Ben Mueller was on duty. \"It felt a little anticlimactic,\" he said. \"There had been such fireworks, and then the legislation passed without contention.\"\n\nAlcohol was banned in Parliament Square for the big celebration, but vendors brought in beer. \"They couldn't do without it,\" Ben said.\n\nThe immediate difference? \"Britain no longer has representation or say in the machinery of the European Union.\"\n\nMany other aspects of the departure remain, to be resolved (or not) during a transition period that will end when 2020 does. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already signaled a tough stand for trade talks that will begin in March.\n\nBen noted that even hopes to have the moment marked by a bong from Big Ben had been dashed. The Palace of Westminster is under renovation, and speeding the process up to allow the clock bell to sound would have cost 500,000 pounds (about $650,000). Efforts to raise the money fell short, and parliamentary officials nixed the plan.\n\nSo a recording of Big Ben was played outside. Inside 10 Downing Street, Mr. Johnson banged a gong.\n\nThat's it for this briefing. See you next time.\n\n-- Chris\n\nThank you\n\nMark Josephson and Eleanor Stanford provided the break from the news. Andrea Kannapell, the Briefings editor, wrote today's Back Story.

China -- A doctor who was among the first to warn about the coronavirus outbreak -- only to be silenced by the police -- was clinging to life on Friday after having become infected, the hospital treating him reported.\n\nThe Wuhan City Central Hospital said in a post at about 12:45 a.m. on Friday on its official account on the Chinese social media site, Weibo, that it was still trying to save the doctor, Li Wenliang, and that he was in critical condition.\n\nOther Chinese news reports said, without clear sourcing, that Dr. Li, 34, was already dead. The World Health Organization issued a message of condolence on Twitter, without specifying the source of its information.\n\nThe New York Times wrote about the doctor on Feb. 1, documenting his efforts to alert colleagues about patient illnesses that resembled Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS, the deadly coronavirus affliction that ravaged China nearly two decades ago.\n\nThe reports of Dr. Li's death triggered an outpouring of messages on the Chinese internet that lionized him as a hero for having stood up against officials who tried to downplay the spreading epidemic that has engulfed Wuhan, spilled across China and ignited an international health crisis.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nDr. Li's fate is a singularly delicate issue for the Chinese government, which has tried to fight back against the coronavirus, while also stifling widespread criticism that officials have delayed and mismanaged the government's response to the initial outbreak in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China's Hubei Province.\n\nJiemian, a Chinese news website, was among those that reported Dr. Li's death, citing the doctor's classmates. After falling ill from an infection of the coronavirus, he had made a turn for the better but then relapsed, the report said. Global Times, another Chinese news service, also reported Dr. Li's death.\n\nSome of the reports of his death were taken down.\n\nDr. Li was questioned by hospital officials and the police in early January after he warned a circle of medical school classmates on Dec. 30 about a viral outbreak that he said appeared similar to SARS. The police compelled him to sign a statement denouncing his warning as an unfounded and illegal rumor.\n\nSoon, however, Dr. Li's warning was vindicated as growing numbers of residents in Wuhan fell ill with fever and pneumonia symptoms after infection with the virus.
