Biden Jr., who emerges as the presumptive nominee for the general election.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont ended his presidential candidacy on Wednesday, concluding a quest that elevated him as a standard-bearer of American liberalism and clearing the way for a general election between the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and President Trump at a time of national crisis.\n\nIn a live-streamed speech, Mr. Sanders, eloquent but without his characteristic spark, cast his decision in the broader context of the fight against the coronavirus. \"I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour,\" Mr. Sanders said, adding, \"While this campaign is coming to an end, our movement is not.\"\n\nIf Mr. Biden, the former vice president, can now lay claim to the Democratic nomination, he still faces considerable challenges in uniting the party and mobilizing a broad base of voters for the November election. Unlike Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden inspired little enthusiasm among young voters, nor did he develop signature policy proposals. He triumphed because many voters rejected Mr. Sanders's policy agenda as too far to the left and prohibitively expansive, and were convinced that Mr. Biden had the best chance to beat Mr. Trump in November.\n\nTo motivate liberal Democrats who find him frustratingly conventional, Mr. Biden, 77, will most likely need to do far more to articulate an agenda on foundational Democratic issues like health care and climate change.\n\nThose issues are central to Mr. Sanders's candidacy, and in recent days, as Mr. Sanders began to consider dropping out more seriously, his aides intensified talks to find common ground with the Biden campaign. Mr. Sanders ultimately became satisfied that there was movement in directions that he wanted, a top aide said. The Biden campaign is expected to roll out a series of policy agreements with Mr. Sanders on health care and other issues -- potentially including student loans -- starting on Thursday, according to three people with direct knowledge of their plans.The two camps were still negotiating the details on Wednesday, and while Mr. Biden is not expected to embrace Mr. Sanders's full-throated call for \"Medicare for all,\" for example, they are striving to arrive at positions with which they are both comfortable.\n\nShortly after Mr. Sanders spoke on Wednesday, Mr. Biden issued a statement thanking his opponent while acknowledging the need to draw Mr. Sanders's loyal base into his coalition. \"I'll be reaching out to you,'' Mr. Biden wrote. \"You will be heard by me.\"\n\n\"And to your supporters,\" he added, \"I make the same commitment: I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country.\"\n\nThough Mr. Sanders made it clear on Wednesday that he viewed Mr. Biden as the party's 2020 nominee, he said he would remain on the ballot in states that still have primaries to try to gather delegates -- a move that could give him leverage to influence the Democratic platform and continue carrying his message.\n\nMr. Sanders's departure from the race is a striking turnaround for a candidate who less than two months ago was the clear front-runner, after finishing in a virtual tie for first in Iowa and winning in New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nBut in a race reshaped, and eclipsed, by the escalating coronavirus crisis, Mr. Sanders faced no realistic path to the nomination after a series of lopsided losses to Mr. Biden, beginning in South Carolina in late February and culminating with victories by Mr. Biden in crucial states like Michigan and Florida last month.\n\nPersistent and unyielding in pushing his agenda, Mr. Sanders is loath to admit defeat; his withdrawal represents a tacit concession that without a chance of overtaking Mr. Biden, he would have more leverage to advance his priorities if he ceded the race and joined forces with his rival.\n\nHis exit is also a sharp contrast to his bid in 2016, when he stayed in an increasingly acrimonious race against Hillary Clinton even after it became clear she would be the nominee. Talks between the Biden and Sanders camps this time around were eased by the cordial relationship between the two principals. Mr. Sanders has told people close to him that he appreciated the fact that Mr. Biden did not overtly pressure him to quit after Super Tuesday.\n\nMr. Sanders also talked to former President Barack Obama at least twice in the last month, a person familiar with the discussions said, with Mr. Obama praising the Vermont senator's campaign and emphasizing the need to unite against Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama, who has told friends he hopes to ease the integration of Sanders voters into the party, made no effort to pressure him to leave.\n\nAs Mr. Sanders pursued the White House for a second time, he promised that he could transform the electorate, bringing new voters under the Democratic tent, but that goal eluded him. Even Mr. Sanders has lamented that he was unable to produce a surge in young voters.\n\nIn early primaries this year, he also failed to show that he had remedied a crucial weakness from his 2016 run: a lack of support from black voters, a vital base of the Democratic Party. In state after state across the South -- Alabama, the Carolinas, Mississippi, Virginia -- he was unable to chip away at Mr. Biden's strong support among African-Americans.\n\nIn many ways, Mr. Sanders never overcame the widely held view among Democrats that he was a political outlier, a self-described democratic socialist who proudly proclaimed himself to be an independent senator from Vermont rather than a member of the party establishment.\n\nMr. Sanders championed liberal policies like \"Medicare for all\" and tuition-free four-year public colleges aimed at lifting up America's working class, but he faced opposition from many party leaders, elected officials and major donors, as well as large numbers of moderate voters who saw him as too far left.\n\nMr. Sanders never accepted that argument. In recent weeks he said repeatedly that he had won the ideological debate, asserting that a strong majority of Democrats supported his progressive agenda.\n\nBut during a striking news conference in Burlington, Vt., last month, he also acknowledged that he was losing the electability battle to Mr. Biden, saying voters had made clear that they thought the former vice president was the best candidate to beat Mr. Trump.\n\nThe president immediately tried to sow discord among Democrats. In a Twitter post he blamed Mr. Sanders's inability to win Super Tuesday states on his ideological rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and then invited Sanders supporters to \"come to the Republican Party.\" At his evening news briefing Mr. Trump was more pointed toward Mr. Biden, saying \"It amazes me that President Obama hasn't supported Sleepy Joe. It just hasn't happened. When's it going to happen?\"\n\nIndeed, Mr. Trump's penchant for no-holds-barred political combat presents another challenge for Mr. Biden. Some Democrats question whether he can withstand the kind of bitingly personal onslaught that Mr. Trump is certain to direct his way in the general election. The president's efforts to tar Mr. Biden with the overseas business dealings of his son, Hunter, already upended the campaign once and led to Mr. Trump's impeachment.\n\nMr. Sanders, 78, leaves the campaign having almost single-handedly moved the Democratic Party to the left. He also transformed the way Democratic campaigns raised money, eschewing big fund-raisers and instead relying on an army of small-dollar donors.\n\nBut as he ascended to the top of the field in February, establishment Democrats scrambled to block his path, convinced his far-reaching proposals would alienate great swaths of the electorate and make him an easy target for Mr. Trump.\n\nModerate candidates in the race who could not overcome Mr. Biden dropped out and endorsed him just before Super Tuesday, on March 3, helping him sweep 10 of 14 states on the biggest voting day of the primary. That led to a wave of new endorsements and a remarkable coalescing around Mr. Biden that Mr. Sanders could not match on the left.\n\nMr. Sanders's insistence on Wednesday that wants to amass delegates to exert influence on the platform has convinced some Democrats that a scaled-down or even virtual convention this summer might be preferable to a traditional event. If the nomination is conferred virtually, the argument goes, Mr. Biden's campaign can control the platform deliberations and program entirely, and ensure minimal dissent from Sanders supporters.\n\nThe networks and cable stations would still carry whatever speeches Mr. Biden's advisers plan and there would be no live audience to interrupt the proceedings.\n\nFor most of his campaign Mr. Sanders largely stuck to his familiar message, battling establishment forces rather than his immediate rivals. Amid a slump in the polls in the fall, he suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas, a startling event that threatened to upend his bid.\n\nBut in a remarkable turn of events -- as he stood on the debate stage just two weeks after his heart attack -- he received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the most visible liberal congresswomen and a star of the left. It helped jump-start his candidacy just as it appeared in jeopardy of collapsing.\n\nThe endorsement helped carry him through the late fall and early winter, and in January, as the first voting approached, Mr. Sanders was surging. When he dominated the field in the Nevada caucuses in February there was suddenly talk that he might run away with the nomination.\n\nBut his loss in South Carolina to Mr. Biden, who had emerged as the leading moderate in the race, brought his momentum to an abrupt halt.\n\nGlenn Thrush, Alexander Burns, Jonathan Martin and Reid J.

Outbreak\n\nA top White House adviser starkly warned Trump administration officials in late January that the coronavirus crisis could cost the United States trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of illness or death.\n\nThe warning, written in a memo by Peter Navarro, President Trump's trade adviser, is the highest-level alert known to have circulated inside the West Wing as the administration was taking its first substantive steps to confront a crisis that had already consumed China's leaders and would go on to upend life in Europe and the United States.\n\n\"The lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on U.S. soil,\" Mr. Navarro's memo said. \"This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.\"\n\nDated Jan. 29, it came during a period when Mr. Trump was playing down the risks to the United States, and he would later go on to say that no one could have predicted such a devastating outcome.\n\nMr. Navarro said in the memo that the administration faced a choice about how aggressive to be in containing an outbreak, saying the human and economic costs would be relatively low if it turned out to be a problem along the lines of a seasonal flu.\n\nBut he went on to emphasize that the \"risk of a worst-case pandemic scenario should not be overlooked\" given the information coming from China.\n\nIn one worst-case scenario cited in the memo, more than a half-million Americans could die.\n\nThe memo was dated the same day that Mr. Trump named a White House task force to deal with the threat, and as the administration was weighing whether to bar some travelers from China, an option being pushed by Mr. Navarro.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Navarro warned in January that a pandemic could imperil the lives of millions of Americans. White House task force strikes a cautiously optimistic tone. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to intensive care. See more updates Updated 12m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\nMr. Trump would approve the limits on travel from China the next day, though it would be weeks before he began taking more aggressive steps to head off spread of the virus.\n\nQuestions about Mr. Trump's handling of crisis, especially in its early days when he suggested it was being used by Democrats to undercut his re-election prospects, are likely to define his presidency. Mr. Navarro's memo is evidence that some in the upper ranks of the administration had at least considered the possibility of the outbreak turning into something far more serious than Mr. Trump was acknowledging publicly at the time.\n\nNeither Mr. Navarro nor spokespeople for the White House responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe memo, which was reviewed by The New York Times, was sent from Mr. Navarro to the National Security Council and then distributed to several officials across the administration, people familiar with the events said. It reached a number of top officials as well as aides to Mick Mulvaney, then the acting chief of staff, they said, but it was unclear whether Mr. Trump saw it.\n\nMr. Navarro is a well-established China hawk who has long been mistrustful of the country's government and trade practices. Both Mr. Navarro and Matthew Pottinger, the chief deputy at the National Security Council, were among the few officials urging colleagues in January to take a harder line in relation to the growing threat of the coronavirus.\n\nBut their warnings were seen by other officials as primarily reflecting their concerns about China's behavior -- and their concerns look more prescient in hindsight than they actually were, other officials argue.\n\nWith the subject line \"Impose Travel Ban on China?\" Mr. Navarro opened the memo by writing, \"If the probability of a pandemic is greater than roughly 1%, a game-theoretic analysis of the coronavirus indicates the clear dominant strategy is an immediate travel ban on China.\"\n\nMr. Navarro concluded at one point: \"Regardless of whether the coronavirus proves to be a pandemic-level outbreak, there are certain costs associated with engaging in policies to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease. The most readily available option to contain the spread of the outbreak is to issue a travel ban to and from the source of the outbreak, namely, mainland China.\"\n\nHe suggested that under an \"aggressive\" containment scenario, a travel ban may need to last as long as 12 months for proper containment, a duration of time that at that point some White House aides saw as unsustainable.\n\nThe travel limits subsequently imposed by Mr. Trump did not entirely ban travel from China, and many travelers continued to stream into the United States from China.\n\nMr. Navarro was at odds with medical experts like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who had argued that such travel bans only delay the eventual spread but do not contain it.\n\nMr. Navarro alluded to that debate on Saturday during a separate argument with Dr. Fauci in the Situation Room about the whether the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was effective in treating or preventing the virus, according to two people familiar with the events.\n\nIn the memo, Mr. Navarro cautioned that it was \"unlikely the introduction of the coronavirus into the U.S. population in significant numbers will mimic a 'seasonal flu' event with relatively low contagion and mortality rates.\"\n\nHe noted the history of pandemic flus and suggested the chances were elevated for one after the new pathogen had developed in China.\n\n\"This historical precedent alone should be sufficient to prove the need to take aggressive action to contain the outbreak,\" he wrote, going on to say the early estimates of how easily the virus was spreading supported the possibility that the risks were even greater than the history of flu pandemics suggested.\n\nMark Mazzetti contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maggie_haberman@nytimes.com", "name": "Maggie Haberman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive Order 13769"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boris Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

He was 73.\n\nThe cause was complications of the coronavirus, his family said.\n\nMr. Prine underwent cancer surgery in 1998 to remove a tumor in his neck identified as squamous cell cancer, which had damaged his vocal cords. In 2013, he had part of one lung removed to treat lung cancer.\n\nMr. Prine was a relative unknown in 1970 when Mr. Kristofferson heard him play one night at a small Chicago club called the Fifth Peg, dragged there by the singer-songwriter Steve Goodman. Mr. Kristofferson was performing in Chicago at the time at the Quiet Knight. At the Fifth Peg, Mr. Prine treated him to a brief after-hours performance of material that, Mr. Kristofferson later wrote, \"was unlike anything I'd heard before.\"\n\nA few weeks later, when Mr. Prine was in New York, Mr. Kristofferson invited him onstage at the Bitter End in Greenwich Village, where he was appearing with Carly Simon, and introduced him to the audience.\n\n\"No way somebody this young can be writing so heavy,\" he said. \"John Prine is so good, we may have to break his thumbs.\"\n\nThe record executive Jerry Wexler, who was in the audience, signed Mr. Prine to a contract with Atlantic Records the next day.\n\nMusic writers at the time were eager to crown a successor to Mr. Dylan, and Mr. Prine, with his nasal, sandpapery voice and literate way with a song, came ready to order. His debut album, called simply \"John Prine\" and released in 1971, included songs that became his signatures. Some gained wider fame after being recorded by other artists.\n\nThey included \"Sam Stone,\" about a drug-addicted war veteran (with the unforgettable refrain \"There's a hole in Daddy's arm where all the money goes\"); \"Hello in There,\" a heart-rending evocation of old age and loneliness; and \"Angel From Montgomery,\" the hard-luck lament of a middle-aged woman dreaming about a better life, later made famous by Bonnie Raitt.\n\n\"He's a true folk singer in the best folk tradition, cutting right to the heart of things, as pure and simple as rain,\" Ms. Raitt told Rolling Stone in 1992.\n\nMr. Dylan, listing his favorite songwriters in a 2009 interview, put Mr. Prine front and center. \"Prine's stuff is pure Proustian existentialism,\" he said. \"Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs.\"\n\nJohn Prine was born on Oct. 10, 1946, in Maywood, Ill., a working-class suburb of Chicago, to William and Verna (Hamm) Prine. His father, a tool-and-die maker at the American Can Company, and his mother had moved from the coal town of Paradise, Ky., in the 1930s.\n\nMr. Prine later wrote a ruefully bitter song titled \"Paradise,\" in which he sang:\n\nThe coal company came with the world's largest shovel\n\nAnd they tortured the timber and stripped all the land\n\nWell, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken\n\nThen they wrote it all down as the progress of man\n\nJohn grew up in a country music-loving family. He learned guitar as a young teenager from his grandfather and brother and began writing songs.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, he worked for the Post Office for two years before being drafted into the Army, which sent him to West Germany in charge of the motor pool at his base. After being discharged, he resumed his mail route, in and around his hometown, composing songs in his head.\n\n\"I always likened the mail route to a library with no books,\" he wrote on his website. \"I passed the time each day making up these little ditties.\"\n\nReluctantly, he took the stage for the first time at an open-mic night at the Fifth Peg, where his performance of \"Hello in There\" and \"Angel From Montgomery\" met with profound silence from the audience. \"They just sat there,\" Mr. Prine wrote. \"They didn't even applaud, they just looked at me.\"\n\nThen the clapping began. \"It was like I found out all of a sudden that I could communicate deep feelings and emotions,\" he wrote. \"And to find that out all at once was amazing.\"\n\nNot long after, Roger Ebert, the film critic for The Chicago Sun-Times, wandered into the club while Mr. Prine was performing. He liked what he heard and wrote Mr. Prine's first review, under the headline \"Singing Mailman Who Delivers a Powerful Message in a Few Words.\"\n\n\"He appears onstage with such modesty he almost seems to be backing into the spotlight,\" Mr. Ebert wrote. \"He sings rather quietly, and his guitar work is good, but he doesn't show off. He starts slow. But after a song or two, even the drunks in the room begin to listen to his lyrics. And then he has you.\"\n\nMr. Prine had a particular gift for offbeat humor, reflected in songs like \"Jesus, the Missing Years,\" \"Some Humans Ain't Human,\" \"Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone\" and the antiwar screed \"Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore.\"\n\n\"I guess what I always found funny was the human condition,\" he told the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph in 2013. \"There is a certain comedy and pathos to trouble and accidents.\"\n\nAfter recording several albums for Atlantic and Asylum, he started his own label, Oh Boy Records, in 1984. He never had a hit record, but he commanded a loyal audience that ensured steady if modest sales for his albums and a durable concert career.\n\nIn 1992, his album \"The Missing Years,\" with guest appearances by Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and other artists, won a Grammy Award for best contemporary folk recording. He received a second Grammy in the same category in 2006 for the album \"Fair and Square.\"\n\nMr. Prine, who lived in Nashville, was divorced twice. He is survived by his wife, Fiona Whelan Prine, a native of Ireland whom he married in 1996; three sons, Jody, Jack and Tommy; two brothers, Dave and Billy; and three grandchildren. In 2017, Mr. Prine published \"John Prine Beyond Words,\" a collection of lyrics, guitar chords, commentary and photographs from his own archive.\n\nIn 2019, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and his album \"Tree of Forgiveness\" was nominated for a Grammy, for best Americana album. It was his 19th album and his first of original material in more than a decade. (The award went to Brandi Carlile, for \"By the Way, I Forgive You.\")\n\nMr. Prine went on tour in 2018 to promote \"Tree of Forgiveness,\" and after a two-night stand at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville -- known there as the mother church of country music -- Margaret Renkl, a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, wrote, under the headline \"American Oracle\":\n\n\"The mother church of country music, where the seats are scratched-up pews and the windows are stained glass, is the place where the new John Prine -- older now, scarred by cancer surgeries, his voice deeper and full of gravel -- is most clearly still the old John Prine: mischievous, delighting in tomfoolery, but also worried about the world.\"\n\nIn December, he was chosen to receive a 2020 Grammy for lifetime achievement.\n\nAs a songwriter, Mr. Prine was prolific and quick. In the early days, he would sometimes dash off a song while driving to a club.\n\n\"Sometimes, the best ones come together at the exact same time, and it takes about as long to write it as it does to sing it,\" he told the poet Ted Kooser in an interview at the Library of Congress in 2005. \"They come along like a dream or something, and you just got to hurry up and respond to it, because if you mess around, the song is liable to pass you by.\"\n\nCaryn Ganz and Neil Vigdor contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

Anyone Found Trump's Soul? Anyone?", "body": "He's not rising to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic. He's shriveling into nothingness.\n\nDo you remember President George W. Bush's remarks at Ground Zero in Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks? I can still hear him speaking of national grief and national pride. This was before all the awful judgment calls and fatal mistakes, and it doesn't excuse them. But it mattered, because it reassured us that our country's leader was navigating some of the same emotional currents that we were.\n\nDo you remember President Barack Obama's news conference after the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., that left 28 people, including 20 children, dead? I do. Freshest in my memory is how he fought back tears. He was hurting. He cared. And while we couldn't bank on new laws to prevent the next massacre, we could at least hold on to that.\n\nOne more question: Do you remember the moment when President Trump's bearing and words made clear that he grasped not only the magnitude of this rapidly metastasizing pandemic but also our terror in the face of it?\n\nIt passed me by, maybe because it never happened.\n\nIn Trump's predecessors, for all their imperfections, I could sense the beat of a heart and see the glimmer of a soul. In him I can't, and that fills me with a sorrow and a rage that I quite frankly don't know what to do with.\n\nAmericans are dying by the thousands, and he gloats about what a huge, rapt television audience he has. They're confronting financial ruin and not sure how they'll continue to pay for food and shelter, and he reprimands governors for not treating him with adequate adulation.\n\nHe's not rising to the challenge before him, not even a millimeter. He's shriveling into nothingness.\n\nOn Friday, when Trump relayed a new recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that all Americans wear face masks in public places, he went so far out of his way to stress that the coverings were voluntary and that he himself wouldn't be going anywhere near one that he might as well have branded them Apparel for Skittish Losers. I've finally settled on his epitaph: \"Donald J. Trump, too cool for the coronavirus.\"\n\nThis is more than a failure of empathy, which is how many observers have described his deficiency. It's more than a failure of decency, which has been my go-to lament. It's a failure of basic humanity.\n\nIn The Washington Post a few days ago, Michael Gerson, a conservative who worked in Bush's White House, wrote that Trump's spirit is \"a vast, trackless wasteland.\" Not exactly trackless. There are gaudy outposts of ego all along the horizon.\n\nWhen the direness of this global health crisis began to be apparent, I was braced for the falsehoods and misinformation that are Trump's trademarks. I was girded for the incompetence that defines an administration with such contempt for proper procedure and for true expertise.\n\nBut what has taken me by surprise and torn me up inside are the aloofness, arrogance, pettiness, meanness, narcissism and solipsism that persist in Trump -- that flourish in him -- even during a once-in-a-lifetime emergency that demands something nobler. Under normal circumstances, these traits are galling. Under the current ones, they're gutting.\n\n\"I don't take responsibility at all.\" \"Did you know I was number one on Facebook?\" To bother with just one of those sentences while a nation trembles is disgusting. To bother with both, as Trump did, is perverse.\n\nFrank Bruni's Newsletter: Get a more personal take on politics, newsmakers and more with Frank's exclusive commentary every week.\n\nHe continues to bash the media, as if the virus were cooked up in the bowels of CNN. He continues to play blame games and to lord his station over those of a lesser political caste, turning governors into grovelers and suggesting that they're whiny piggies at the federal trough.\n\nHe continues his one-man orgy of self-congratulation, so that in the same breath recently he speculated about a toll of 100,000 deaths in America from Covid-19 and crowed about what a great job he's doing.\n\nAnd he continues to taunt and smear his perceived political adversaries. Last week, on Fox News, he called Nancy Pelosi \"a sick puppy.\" This is how he chooses to spend his time and energy?\n\nAt those beloved daily briefings of his, where he talks and talks and talks, he sometimes seems to regard what's happening less as a devastating scourge than as a star-studded event. Just look at the nifty degree of prominence it's conferring on everyone and everything involved! He has mused aloud about how well known Anthony Fauci has become. He has marveled at the disease's celebrity profile.\n\n\"Become a very famous term -- C-O-V-I-D,\" he said on Thursday. Was that envy in his voice?\n\nHe leaps from tone deafness to some realm of complete sensory and moral deprivation.\n\n\"I want to come way under the models,\" he said on Friday, referring to casualty projections. \"The professionals did the models. I was never involved in a model.\"\n\n\"At least this kind of model,\" he added. No context like a pandemic for X-rated humor.\n\nIt's an extraordinary thing: to fill the air with so many words and have none of them carry any genuine sadness or stirring resolve.\n\nI can hear his admirers grumble that he doesn't do camera-perfect emotions, that Obama was just a better actor, that Trump is the more authentic man.\n\nTo which I answer: What's the point of having a showman for a president if he can't put on the right kind of show? Performances count, even if they're just performances. And Trump clearly isn't averse to artifice. Just looks at his hair.\n\nA cheap shot? I'm feeling cheap. A loss of life and livelihoods on this scale will do that to you.\n\nAs of this writing, at least 9,600 people with the coronavirus have died in the United States. That's more than three times the number killed in the Sept. 11 attacks. New York State alone reported 630 new deaths on Saturday . No school shooting has taken even a small faction of as many lives.\n\nAnd while I'm not looking to Trump for any panacea, is it too much to ask for some sign that the dying has made an impression on him, that the crying has penetrated his carapace and that he's thinking about something other than his ratings? I watch. I wait. I suspect I'll be doing that forever.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Then the State Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservative justices, overturned the governor's ruling to postpone the election until June.\n\nNow Wisconsin is conducting an election that the state's largest newspaper -- which previously endorsed Republican leaders including former Gov. Scott Walker -- called \"the most undemocratic in the state's history.\"\n\nHere's a look at how it came to this point.\n\nWhy are Republicans fighting so hard to hold an election in the midst of a pandemic?\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders are on the ballot in Wisconsin, but the main event is the State Supreme Court race between the conservative incumbent justice, Daniel Kelly, and a liberal challenger, Jill Karofsky.\n\nThe winner will be in position to cast a deciding vote on a case before the court that seeks to purge more than 200,000 people from Wisconsin's voter rolls -- in a state where 2.6 million people voted in the last governor's race. When the matter was first before the court in January, Mr. Kelly recused himself, citing his upcoming election. He indicated he would \"rethink\" his position following the April election, which comes with a 10-year term.\n\nBut the election proceeding on Tuesday is not just about the voter purge case. It is the latest example of what many in the state see as a decade-long effort by Wisconsin Republicans to dilute the voting power of the state's Democratic and African-American voters.\n\nSince 2011, when Mr. Walker led a Republican takeover of the state government, the G.O.P. has enacted one of nation's strictest laws requiring government-issued identification to vote. The ID must show a current address -- a hardship for poorer black Milwaukee residents who live in neighborhoods with some of the highest eviction rates in the country. A 2017 study by the University of Wisconsin found nearly 17,000 registered voters were unable to cast a ballot during the 2016 election, and untold more were deterred from voting.\n\nThe Republican majority also drew legislative and congressional boundaries that are widely considered the most gerrymandered in the country. During the 2018 election, Democratic candidates won 190,000 more votes for State Assembly seats, but the G.O.P. held a 64-35 advantage in the chamber.\n\nForty Republican lawmakers on Monday wrote to Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, asking him to reopen the state's golf courses.\n\nIf Mr. Kelly wins, it would cement the conservative majority's ability to block any future Democratic efforts to change voting laws and litigate an expected stalemate over congressional and state legislative boundaries during redistricting that will follow the 2020 census.\n\nWhat does the Wisconsin fight mean for November?\n\nWisconsin is, by many projections, a key state for clinching an Electoral College victory. And in the last four years it has seen some of the closest statewide races in the country.\n\nIn 2016, President Trump won the state by less than 23,000 votes.\n\nIn 2018, Mr. Evers ousted Mr. Walker by less than 30,000 votes.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Trump effectively ousts the top watchdog for the $2 trillion in virus relief. Major challenges remain in grappling with the virus amid some encouraging signs. New York records the largest number of deaths in a single day. See more updates Updated 12m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\nIn 2019, a State Supreme Court race was decided by just 6,000 votes.\n\nIn a state so closely divided, any adjustment to voting procedures or voter eligibility has the potential to swing enough votes to tip the state.\n\nWhy did Mr. Evers wait so long to try to postpone the election?\n\nThis is truly a mystery that has consumed Democrats both inside and outside Wisconsin.\n\nFor weeks Mr. Evers insisted he didn't have the power to change the election date without consent of the state legislature, which consistently refused to entertain the idea.\n\nInstead he sought other remedies, such as sending absentee ballots to all voters and extending the time for voters to return ballots by mail -- ideas that Republicans resisted and that were eventually struck down in courts dominated by Republican appointees.\n\nMr. Evers, a bland former state education secretary who won in 2018 on the backs of liberal anger and disgust with Mr. Walker, spent the run-up to the election \"grandstanding with impossible demands,\" said John Langeland, the Democratic Party chairman of Oneida County, in Wisconsin's Northwoods. \"He had to know that there was no way to print, distribute and tally enough ballots for an absentee-only election.\"\n\nBut Mr. Evers wasn't helped by disunity among leaders and national figures in his own party. While Mr. Sanders last week called for postponing the state's election, Mr. Biden predicted the contest could be held safely.\n\nWhy did Democrats seek to postpone the election until June?\n\nIn Wisconsin, the pandemic is hitting hardest in Milwaukee's black neighborhoods, which are home to a critical Democratic voting bloc. Of the 83 coronavirus deaths in the state, 33 have been black residents of Milwaukee -- 40 percent of the total in a state that is 7 percent black.\n\nDemocrats had hoped postponing the contest to June and changing it to an all-mail election would alleviate fears of the pandemic and allow people to vote safely. With the state so divided, any tangible drop-off in urban turnout is likely to tip the State Supreme Court race to Mr. Kelly.\n\nWho is actually voting in Tuesday's election?\n\nPublic health officials across the state have closed hundreds of precincts because of the coronavirus pandemic. In Milwaukee, just five of 180 planned polling places are open, leading to hourslong lines of masked and socially distanced voters.\n\nThis comes as Milwaukee voters -- an electorate that includes nearly all of the state's black population -- have lagged well behind suburban counterparts in returning absentee ballots.\n\nDuring the 2018 election, the number of votes from Waukesha County made up about 57 percent of the total number of votes from adjacent Milwaukee County. Two-thirds of Milwaukee County voters backed Mr. Evers, the Democrat, while two-thirds of Waukesha County voters picked Mr. Walker, the Republican.\n\nAbsentee ballot data from the Wisconsin Election Commission shows that, as of Tuesday morning, Waukesha County voters have returned 78 percent as many absentee ballots as have Milwaukee County voters -- a drastic narrowing of the voting gap between the two counties.\n\nThe data also shows that absentee turnout is far higher in the state's major metropolitan areas than it is in the rural counties.\n\nStatewide, 864,750 people had returned absentee ballots by Tuesday morning, according to the elections commission. But that data shows voters in urban centers were returning ballots at a far higher clip than rural Wisconsinites.\n\nSeven counties have returned absentee ballots that account for more than 80 percent of the total turnout from the 2019 spring election, which also featured a State Supreme Court race but no presidential primary. Five of the seven are in greater Milwaukee, and the other two include Madison and La Crosse, both college towns.\n\nSome predominately rural counties saw comparatively few absentee ballots returned. Clark County, in the state's north, and Menominee County, whose population is largely Native American, had an absentee ballot return rate of just 17 percent of their 2019 turnout.\n\nBruce Johnson, the Democratic chairman in Pepin County, along the state's western border with Minnesota, said he pushed for absentee balloting but people were less concerned because they rarely wait in lines to vote. Pepin County's absentee ballot return rate is just 24 percent of its 2019 turnout.\n\n\"The primary risk is to poll workers and we've had some difficulty filling those positions because most trained workers are of vulnerable, elderly populations,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"Given the proclaimed inevitability of a Biden nomination and the risks involved in voting, I fear that the Republican voter suppression efforts will succeed.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reid_j_epstein@nytimes.com", "name": "Reid J.

"The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Trump made a rare appearance in the Situation Room on Sunday as his pandemic task force was meeting, determined to talk about the anti-malaria medicine that he has aggressively promoted lately as a treatment for the coronavirus.\n\nOnce again, according to a person briefed on the session, the experts warned against overselling a drug yet to be proved a safe remedy, particularly for heart patients. \"Yes, the heart stuff,\" Mr. Trump acknowledged. Then he headed out to the cameras to promote it anyway. \"So what do I know?\" he conceded to reporters at his daily briefing. \"I'm not a doctor. But I have common sense.\"\n\nDay after day, the salesman turned president has encouraged coronavirus patients to try hydroxychloroquine with all of the enthusiasm of a real estate developer. The passing reference he makes to the possible dangers is usually overwhelmed by the full-throated endorsement. \"What do you have to lose?\" he asked five times on Sunday.\n\nBolstered by his trade adviser, a television doctor, Larry Ellison of Oracle and Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York mayor, Mr. Trump has seized on the drug as a miracle cure for the virus that has killed thousands and paralyzed American life. Along the way, he has prompted an international debate about a drug that many doctors in New York and elsewhere have been trying in desperation even without conclusive scientific studies.\n\nMr. Trump may ultimately be right, and physicians report anecdotal evidence that has provided hope. But it remains far from certain, and the president's assertiveness in pressing the case over the advice of advisers like Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government's top infectious disease specialist, has driven a wedge inside his coronavirus task force and has raised questions about his motives.\n\nIf hydroxychloroquine becomes an accepted treatment, several pharmaceutical companies stand to profit, including shareholders and senior executives with connections to the president. Mr. Trump himself has a small personal financial interest in Sanofi, the French drugmaker that makes Plaquenil, the brand-name version of hydroxychloroquine.\n\n\"I certainly understand why the president is pushing it,\" said Dr. Joshua Rosenberg, a critical care at Brooklyn Hospital Center. \"He's the president of the United States. He has to project hope. And when you are in a situation without hope, things go very badly. So I'm not faulting him for pushing it even if there isn't a lot of science behind it, because it is, at this point, the best, most available option for use.\"\n\nA senior physician at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn, where doctors are not providing the drug, however, said the current demand was worrisome for patients on it chronically for rheumatic diseases. At St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, another doctor said his staff was giving it to coronavirus patients but criticized the president and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for \"cheerleading\" the drug without proof. \"False hope can be bad, too,\" he said.\n\nThe professional organization that published a positive French study cited by Mr. Trump's allies changed its mind in recent days. The International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy said, \"The article does not meet the society's expected standard.\" Some hospitals in Sweden stopped providing hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus after reports of adverse side effects, according to Swedish news media.\n\nBut Mr. Cuomo told reporters on Monday that he would ask Mr. Trump to increase the federal supply of hydroxychloroquine to New York pharmacies, allowing the state to lift a limit on purchases. \"There has been anecdotal evidence that it is promising,\" Mr. Cuomo said, while noting the lack of a formal study.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Glimmers of hope, and new challenges, as the world struggles to beat back the virus. A top White House official warned in January that a pandemic could imperil millions of Americans. Britain is gripped by concerns for the health of its prime minister, and questions of succession. See more updates Updated 1m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\nMr. Trump first expressed interest in hydroxychloroquine a few weeks ago, telling associates that Mr. Ellison, a billionaire and a founder of Oracle, had discussed it with him. At the time, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the host of television's \"The Doctor Oz Show,\" was in touch with Mr. Trump's advisers about expediting approval to use the drug for the coronavirus.\n\nMr. Giuliani has urged Mr. Trump to embrace the drug, based in part on the advice of Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, a self-described simple country doctor who has become a hit on conservative media after administering a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic azithromycin and zinc sulfate.\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Mr. Giuliani denied any financial stake and said he spoke with Mr. Trump only after the president had already promoted the drug publicly. Mr. Giuliani said he turned to the issue after researching former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Ukraine, a project that led to the president's impeachment.\n\n\"When I finished Biden, I immediately switched to coronavirus and I have been doing an enormous amount of research on it,\" he said. As it happened, Dr. Zelenko was born in Ukraine, and when they first spoke, Mr. Giuliani accidentally called him \"Dr. Zelensky,\" mixing up his name with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nMr. Giuliani said he brought a prosecutor's experience to his research. \"One of the things that a good litigator becomes, is you kind of become an instant expert on stuff, and then you forget about it,\" he said. \"I don't claim to be a doctor. I just repeat what they said.\"\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, which has approved hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for malaria and lupus, issued an emergency order late last month allowing doctors to administer it to coronavirus patients if they saw fit. Mr. Trump said the federal government would distribute 29 million doses and that he had called Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India requesting more.\n\nDr. Fauci made his concern clear last week. \"I think we've got to be careful that we don't make that majestic leap to assume that this is a knockout drug,\" he said on Friday on Fox News. \"We still need to do the kinds of studies that definitively prove whether any intervention, not just this one, any intervention is truly safe and effective.\"\n\nThe same day, Laura Ingraham, a Fox host, visited Mr. Trump at the White House with two doctors who had been on her program promoting hydroxychloroquine, one of whom made a presentation on its virtues, according to an official, confirming a Washington Post report.\n\nThe next day, Peter Navarro, the president's trade adviser, who has been assigned to expedite production of medical equipment and become an advocate of the drug, upbraided Dr. Fauci at a White House task force meeting, according to people informed about the discussion.\n\nMr. Navarro arrived at the meeting armed with a thick sheaf of papers recounting research. When the issue was raised, according to a person informed about the meeting, confirming a report by Axios, Mr. Navarro picked it up off a chair, dropped it on the table and started handing out copies.\n\nMr. Navarro, who earned a doctorate in economics from Harvard, defended his position on Monday despite his lack of medical credentials. \"Doctors disagree about things all the time. My qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I'm a social scientist,\" he said on CNN. \"I have a Ph.D. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it's in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.\"\n\nMr. Trump made clear on Sunday whose side he took in Mr. Navarro's confrontation with Dr. Fauci. At his briefing after the meeting, he said it was wrong to wait for the kind of study Dr. Fauci wanted. \"We don't have time,\" the president said. \"We don't have two hours because there are people dying right now.\"\n\nSome associates of Mr. Trump's have financial interests in the issue. Sanofi's largest shareholders include Fisher Asset Management, the investment company run by Ken Fisher, a major donor to Republicans, including Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Fisher declined to comment.\n\nAnother investor in both Sanofi and Mylan, another pharmaceutical firm, is Invesco, the fund previously run by Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary. Mr. Ross said in a statement Monday that he \"was not aware that Invesco has any investments in companies producing\" the drug, \"nor do I have any involvement in the decision to explore this as a treatment.\"\n\nAs of last year, Mr. Trump reported that his three family trusts each had investments in a Dodge & Cox mutual fund, whose largest holding was in Sanofi.\n\nAshleigh Koss, a Sanofi spokeswoman, said the company no longer sells or distributes Plaquenil in the United States, although it does sell it internationally.\n\nSeveral generic drugmakers are gearing up to produce hydroxychloroquine pills, including Amneal Pharmaceuticals, whose co-founder Chirag Patel is a member of Trump National Golf Course Bedminster in New Jersey and has golfed with Mr. Trump at least twice since he became president, according to a person who saw them.\n\nMr. Patel, whose company is based in Bridgewater, N.J., did not respond to a request for comment. Amneal announced last month that it would increase production of the drug and donate millions of pills to New York and other states. Other generic drugmakers are ramping up production, including Mylan and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.\n\nRoberto Mignone, a Teva board member, reached out to the team of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, through Nitin Saigal, who used to work for Mr. Mignone and is a friend of Mr. Kushner's, according to people informed about the discussions.\n\nMr. Kushner's team referred him to the White House task force and Mr. Mignone asked for help getting India to ease export restrictions, which have since been relaxed, allowing Teva to bring more pills into the United States. Mr. Mignone, who is also a vice chairman of NYU Langone Health, which is running a clinical study of hydroxychloroquine, confirmed on Monday that he has spoken with the administration about getting more medicine into the country.\n\nDr. Daniel H. Sterman, the critical care director at NYU Langone Health, said doctors there are using hydroxychloroquine, but data about its effectiveness remained \"weak and unsubstantiated\" pending the study. \"We do not know whether our patients are benefiting from hydroxychloroquine treatment at the present time,\" he said.\n\nNew York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs its public hospitals, is advising but not requiring doctors to use hydroxychloroquine based on a trial showing a decreased cough and fever with mild side effects in two patients, Dr. Mitchell Katz, who oversees the hospital system, said by email on Monday.\n\nDr. Roy M. Gulick, the chief of infectious diseases at Weill Cornell Medicine, said hydroxychloroquine was given on a case-by-case basis. \"We explain the pros and cons and explain that we don't know if it works or not,\" he said.\n\nDoctors at Northwell Health and Mount Sinai Health System are using it as well. At the Mount Sinai South Nassau County branch on Long Island, doctors have employed a regimen of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin \"pretty much since day one\" with mixed results, said Dr. Adhi Sharma, its chief medical officer.\n\n\"We've been throwing the kitchen sink at these patients,\" he said. \"I can't tell whether someone got better on their own or because of the medication.\"\n\nPeter Baker and Katie Rogers reported from Washington, and David Enrich and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- \"Any way you cut it, this is going to be bad,\" a senior medical adviser at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Dr. Carter Mecher, wrote on the night of Jan. 28, in an email to a group of public health experts scattered around the government and universities. \"The projected size of the outbreak already seems hard to believe.\"\n\nA week after the first coronavirus case had been identified in the United States, and six long weeks before President Trump finally took aggressive action to confront the danger the nation was facing -- a pandemic that is now forecast to take tens of thousands of American lives -- Dr. Mecher was urging the upper ranks of the nation's public health bureaucracy to wake up and prepare for the possibility of far more drastic action.\n\n\"You guys made fun of me screaming to close the schools,\" he wrote to the group, which called itself \"Red Dawn,\" an inside joke based on the 1984 movie about a band of Americans trying to save the country after a foreign invasion. \"Now I'm screaming, close the colleges and universities.\"\n\nHis was hardly a lone voice. Throughout January, as Mr. Trump repeatedly played down the seriousness of the virus and focused on other issues, an array of figures inside his government -- from top White House advisers to experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies -- identified the threat, sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action.\n\nThe president, though, was slow to absorb the scale of the risk and to act accordingly, focusing instead on controlling the message, protecting gains in the economy and batting away warnings from senior officials. It was a problem, he said, that had come out of nowhere and could not have been foreseen.\n\nEven after Mr. Trump took his first concrete action at the end of January -- limiting travel from China -- public health often had to compete with economic and political considerations in internal debates, slowing the path toward belated decisions to seek more money from Congress, obtain necessary supplies, address shortfalls in testing and ultimately move to keep much of the nation at home.\n\nUnfolding as it did in the wake of his impeachment by the House and in the midst of his Senate trial, Mr. Trump's response was colored by his suspicion of and disdain for what he viewed as the \"Deep State\" -- the very people in his government whose expertise and long experience might have guided him more quickly toward steps that would slow the virus, and likely save lives.\n\nDecision-making was also complicated by a long-running dispute inside the administration over how to deal with China. The virus at first took a back seat to a desire not to upset Beijing during trade talks, but later the impulse to score points against Beijing left the world's two leading powers further divided as they confronted one of the first truly global threats of the 21st century.\n\nThe shortcomings of Mr. Trump's performance have played out with remarkable transparency as part of his daily effort to dominate television screens and the national conversation.\n\nBut dozens of interviews with current and former officials and a review of emails and other records revealed many previously unreported details and a fuller picture of the roots and extent of his halting response as the deadly virus spread:\n\nThe National Security Council office responsible for tracking pandemics received intelligence reports in early January predicting the spread of the virus to the United States, and within weeks was raising options like keeping Americans home from work and shutting down cities the size of Chicago. Mr. Trump would avoid such steps until March.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump's denial weeks later, he was told at the time about a Jan. 29 memo produced by his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, laying out in striking detail the potential risks of a coronavirus pandemic: as many as half a million deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses.\n\nThe health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II, directly warned Mr. Trump of the possibility of a pandemic during a call on Jan. 30, the second warning he delivered to the president about the virus in two weeks. The president, who was on Air Force One while traveling for appearances in the Midwest, responded that Mr. Azar was being alarmist.\n\nMr. Azar publicly announced in February that the government was establishing a \"surveillance\" system in five American cities to measure the spread of the virus and enable experts to project the next hot spots. It was delayed for weeks. The slow start of that plan, on top of the well-documented failures to develop the nation's testing capacity, left administration officials with almost no insight into how rapidly the virus was spreading. \"We were flying the plane with no instruments,\" one official said.\n\nBy the third week in February, the administration's top public health experts concluded they should recommend to Mr. Trump a new approach that would include warning the American people of the risks and urging steps like social distancing and staying home from work. But the White House focused instead on messaging and crucial additional weeks went by before their views were reluctantly accepted by the president -- time when the virus spread largely unimpeded.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump finally agreed in mid-March to recommend social distancing across the country, effectively bringing much of the economy to a halt, he seemed shellshocked and deflated to some of his closest associates. One described him as \"subdued\" and \"baffled\" by how the crisis had played out. An economy that he had wagered his re-election on was suddenly in shambles.\n\nHe only regained his swagger, the associate said, from conducting his daily White House briefings, at which he often seeks to rewrite the history of the past several months. He declared at one point that he \"felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,\" and insisted at another that he had to be a \"cheerleader for the country,\" as if that explained why he failed to prepare the public for what was coming.\n\nMr. Trump's allies and some administration officials say the criticism has been unfair. The Chinese government misled other governments, they say. And they insist that the president was either not getting proper information, or the people around him weren't conveying the urgency of the threat. In some cases, they argue, the specific officials he was hearing from had been discredited in his eyes, but once the right information got to him through other channels, he made the right calls.\n\n\"While the media and Democrats refused to seriously acknowledge this virus in January and February, President Trump took bold action to protect Americans and unleash the full power of the federal government to curb the spread of the virus, expand testing capacities and expedite vaccine development even when we had no true idea the level of transmission or asymptomatic spread,\" said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman.\n\nThere were key turning points along the way, opportunities for Mr. Trump to get ahead of the virus rather than just chase it. There were internal debates that presented him with stark choices, and moments when he could have chosen to ask deeper questions and learn more. How he handled them may shape his re-election campaign. They will certainly shape his legacy.\n\nThe Containment Illusion\n\nBy the last week of February, it was clear to the administration's public health team that schools and businesses in hot spots would have to close. But in the turbulence of the Trump White House, it took three more weeks to persuade the president that failure to act quickly to control the spread of the virus would have dire consequences.\n\nWhen Dr. Robert Kadlec, the top disaster response official at the Health and Human Services Department, convened the White House coronavirus task force on Feb. 21, his agenda was urgent. There were deep cracks in the administration's strategy for keeping the virus out of the United States. They were going to have to lock down the country to prevent it from spreading. The question was: When?\n\nThere had already been an alarming spike in new cases around the world and the virus was spreading across the Middle East. It was becoming apparent that the administration had botched the rollout of testing to track the virus at home, and a smaller-scale surveillance program intended to piggyback on a federal flu tracking system had also been stillborn.\n\nIn Washington, the president was not worried, predicting that by April, \"when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.\" His White House had yet to ask Congress for additional funding to prepare for the potential cost of wide-scale infection across the country, and health care providers were growing increasingly nervous about the availability of masks, ventilators and other equipment.\n\nWhat Mr. Trump decided to do next could dramatically shape the course of the pandemic -- and how many people would get sick and die.\n\nWith that in mind, the task force had gathered for a tabletop exercise -- a real-time version of a full-scale war gaming of a flu pandemic the administration had run the previous year. That earlier exercise, also conducted by Mr. Kadlec and called \"Crimson Contagion,\" predicted 110 million infections, 7.7 million hospitalizations and 586,000 deaths following a hypothetical outbreak that started in China.\n\nFacing the likelihood of a real pandemic, the group needed to decide when to abandon \"containment\" -- the effort to keep the virus outside the U.S. and to isolate anyone who gets infected -- and embrace \"mitigation\" to thwart the spread of the virus inside the country until a vaccine becomes available.\n\nAmong the questions on the agenda, which was reviewed by The New York Times, was when the department's secretary, Mr. Azar, should recommend that Mr. Trump take textbook mitigation measures \"such as school dismissals and cancellations of mass gatherings,\" which had been identified as the next appropriate step in a Bush-era pandemic plan.\n\nThe exercise was sobering. The group -- including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci of the National Institutes of Health; Dr. Robert R. Redfield of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Mr. Azar, who at that stage was leading the White House Task Force -- concluded they would soon need to move toward aggressive social distancing, even at the risk of severe disruption to the nation's economy and the daily lives of millions of Americans.\n\nIf Dr. Kadlec had any doubts, they were erased two days later, when he stumbled upon an email from a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who was among the group of academics, government physicians and infectious diseases doctors who had spent weeks tracking the outbreak in the Red Dawn email chain.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Limits on public life slow the outbreak, but patience is wearing thin. Trump reposts a message on Twitter that said, 'Time to #FireFauci.' Should Western states be getting more attention for their handling of the virus? See more updates Updated 24m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nA 20-year-old Chinese woman had infected five relatives with the virus even though she never displayed any symptoms herself. The implication was grave -- apparently healthy people could be unknowingly spreading the virus -- and supported the need to move quickly to mitigation.\n\n\"Is this true?!\" Dr. Kadlec wrote back to the researcher. \"If so we have a huge whole on our screening and quarantine effort,\" including a typo where he meant hole. Her response was blunt: \"People are carrying the virus everywhere.\"\n\nThe following day, Dr. Kadlec and the others decided to present Mr. Trump with a plan titled \"Four Steps to Mitigation,\" telling the president that they needed to begin preparing Americans for a step rarely taken in United States history.\n\nBut over the next several days, a presidential blowup and internal turf fights would sidetrack such a move. The focus would shift to messaging and confident predictions of success rather than publicly calling for a shift to mitigation.\n\nThese final days of February, perhaps more than any other moment during his tenure in the White House, illustrated Mr. Trump's inability or unwillingness to absorb warnings coming at him. He instead reverted to his traditional political playbook in the midst of a public health calamity, squandering vital time as the coronavirus spread silently across the country.\n\nDr. Kadlec's group wanted to meet with the president right away, but Mr. Trump was on a trip to India, so they agreed to make the case to him in person as soon as he returned two days later. If they could convince him of the need to shift strategy, they could immediately begin a national education campaign aimed at preparing the public for the new reality.\n\nA memo dated Feb. 14, prepared in coordination with the National Security Council and titled \"U.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus,\" documented what more drastic measures would look like, including: \"significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone. Consider school closures. Widespread 'stay at home' directives from public and private organizations with nearly 100% telework for some.\"\n\nThe memo did not advocate an immediate national shutdown, but said the targeted use of \"quarantine and isolation measures\" could be used to slow the spread in places where \"sustained human-to-human transmission\" is evident.\n\nWithin 24 hours, before they got a chance to make their presentation to the president, the plan went awry.\n\nMr. Trump was walking up the steps of Air Force One to head home from India on Feb. 25 when Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, publicly issued the blunt warning they had all agreed was necessary.\n\nBut Dr. Messonnier had jumped the gun. They had not told the president yet, much less gotten his consent.\n\nOn the 18-hour plane ride home, Mr. Trump fumed as he watched the stock market crash after Dr. Messonnier's comments. Furious, he called Mr. Azar when he landed at around 6 a.m. on Feb. 26, raging that Dr. Messonnier had scared people unnecessarily. Already on thin ice with the president over a variety of issues and having overseen the failure to quickly produce an effective and widely available test, Mr. Azar would soon find his authority reduced.\n\nThe meeting that evening with Mr. Trump to advocate social distancing was canceled, replaced by a news conference in which the president announced that the White House response would be put under the command of Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe push to convince Mr. Trump of the need for more assertive action stalled. With Mr. Pence and his staff in charge, the focus was clear: no more alarmist messages. Statements and media appearances by health officials like Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield would be coordinated through Mr. Pence's office. It would be more than three weeks before Mr. Trump would announce serious social distancing efforts, a lost period during which the spread of the virus accelerated rapidly.\n\nOver nearly three weeks from Feb. 26 to March 16, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States grew from 15 to 4,226. Since then, nearly half a million Americans have tested positive for the virus and authorities say hundreds of thousands more are likely infected.\n\nThe China Factor\n\nThe earliest warnings about coronavirus got caught in the crosscurrents of the administration's internal disputes over China. It was the China hawks who pushed earliest for a travel ban. But their animosity toward China also undercut hopes for a more cooperative approach by the world's two leading powers to a global crisis.\n\nIt was early January, and the call with a Hong Kong epidemiologist left Matthew Pottinger rattled.\n\nMr. Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser and a hawk on China, took a blunt warning away from the call with the doctor, a longtime friend: A ferocious, new outbreak that on the surface appeared similar to the SARS epidemic of 2003 had emerged in China. It had spread far more quickly than the government was admitting to, and it wouldn't be long before it reached other parts of the world.\n\nMr. Pottinger had worked as a Wall Street Journal correspondent in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic, and was still scarred by his experience documenting the death spread by that highly contagious virus.\n\nNow, seventeen years later, his friend had a blunt message: You need to be ready. The virus, he warned, which originated in the city of Wuhan, was being transmitted by people who were showing no symptoms -- an insight that American health officials had not yet accepted. Mr. Pottinger declined through a spokesman to comment.\n\nIt was one of the earliest warnings to the White House, and it echoed the intelligence reports making their way to the National Security Council. While most of the early assessments from the C.I.A. had little more information than was available publicly, some of the more specialized corners of the intelligence world were producing sophisticated and chilling warnings.\n\nIn a report to the director of national intelligence, the State Department's epidemiologist wrote in early January that the virus was likely to spread across the globe, and warned that the coronavirus could develop into a pandemic. Working independently, a small outpost of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Center for Medical Intelligence, came to the same conclusion. Within weeks after getting initial information about the virus early in the year, biodefense experts inside the National Security Council, looking at what was happening in Wuhan, started urging officials to think about what would be needed to quarantine a city the size of Chicago.\n\nBy mid-January there was growing evidence of the virus spreading outside China. Mr. Pottinger began convening daily meetings about the coronavirus. He alerted his boss, Robert C. O'Brien, the national security adviser.\n\nThe early alarms sounded by Mr. Pottinger and other China hawks were freighted with ideology -- including a push to publicly blame China that critics in the administration say was a distraction as the coronavirus spread to Western Europe and eventually the United States.\n\nAnd they ran into opposition from Mr. Trump's economic advisers, who worried a tough approach toward China could scuttle a trade deal that was a pillar of Mr. Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nWith his skeptical -- some might even say conspiratorial -- view of China's ruling Communist Party, Mr. Pottinger initially suspected that President Xi Jinping's government was keeping a dark secret: that the virus may have originated in one of the laboratories in Wuhan studying deadly pathogens. In his view, it might have even been a deadly accident unleashed on an unsuspecting Chinese population.\n\nDuring meetings and telephone calls, Mr. Pottinger asked intelligence agencies -- including officers at the C.I.A. working on Asia and on weapons of mass destruction -- to search for evidence that might bolster his theory.\n\nThey didn't have any evidence. Intelligence agencies did not detect any alarm inside the Chinese government that analysts presumed would accompany the accidental leak of a deadly virus from a government laboratory. But Mr. Pottinger continued to believe the coronavirus problem was far worse than the Chinese were acknowledging. Inside the West Wing, the director of the Domestic Policy Council, Joe Grogan, also tried to sound alarms that the threat from China was growing.\n\nMr. Pottinger, backed by Mr. O'Brien, became one of the driving forces of a campaign in the final weeks of January to convince Mr. Trump to impose limits on travel from China -- the first substantive step taken to impede the spread of the virus and one that the president has repeatedly cited as evidence that he was on top of the problem.\n\nIn addition to the opposition from the economic team, Mr. Pottinger and his allies among the China hawks had to overcome initial skepticism from the administration's public health experts.\n\nTravel restrictions were usually counterproductive to managing biological outbreaks because they prevented doctors and other much-needed medical help from easily getting to the affected areas, the health officials said. And such bans often cause infected people to flee, spreading the disease further.\n\nBut on the morning of Jan. 30, Mr. Azar got a call from Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield and others saying they had changed their minds. The World Health Organization had declared a global public health emergency and American officials had discovered the first confirmed case of person-to-person transmission inside the United States.\n\nThe economic team, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, continued to argue that there were big risks in taking a provocative step toward China and moving to curb global travel. After a debate, Mr. Trump came down on the side of the hawks and the public health team. The limits on travel from China were publicly announced on Jan. 31.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump and other senior officials were wary of further upsetting Beijing. Besides the concerns about the impact on the trade deal, they knew that an escalating confrontation was risky because the United States relies heavily on China for pharmaceuticals and the kinds of protective equipment most needed to combat the coronavirus.\n\nBut the hawks kept pushing in February to take a critical stance toward China amid the growing crisis. Mr. Pottinger and others -- including aides to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- pressed for government statements to use the term \"Wuhan Virus.\"\n\nMr. Pompeo tried to hammer the anti-China message at every turn, eventually even urging leaders of the Group of 7 industrialized countries to use \"Wuhan virus\" in a joint statement.\n\nOthers, including aides to Mr. Pence, resisted taking a hard public line, believing that angering Beijing might lead the Chinese government to withhold medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and any scientific research that might ultimately lead to a vaccine.\n\nMr. Trump took a conciliatory approach through the middle of March, praising the job Mr. Xi was doing.\n\nThat changed abruptly, when aides informed Mr. Trump that a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman had publicly spun a new conspiracy about the origins of Covid-19: that it was brought to China by U.S. Army personnel who visited the country last October.\n\nMr. Trump was furious, and he took to his favorite platform to broadcast a new message. On March 16, he wrote on Twitter that \"the United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus.\"\n\nMr. Trump's decision to escalate the war of words undercut any remaining possibility of broad cooperation between the governments to address a global threat. It remains to be seen whether that mutual suspicion will spill over into efforts to develop treatments or vaccines, both areas where the two nations are now competing.\n\nOne immediate result was a free-for-all across the United States, with state and local governments and hospitals bidding on the open market for scarce but essential Chinese-made products. When the state of Massachusetts managed to procure 1.2 million masks, it fell to the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert K. Kraft, a Trump ally, to cut through extensive red tape on both sides of the Pacific to send his own plane to pick them up.\n\nThe Consequences of Chaos\n\nThe chaotic culture of the Trump White House contributed to the crisis. A lack of planning and a failure to execute, combined with the president's focus on the news cycle and his preference for following his gut rather than the data cost time, and perhaps lives.\n\nInside the West Wing, Mr. Navarro, Mr. Trump's trade adviser, was widely seen as quick-tempered, self-important and prone to butting in. He is among the most outspoken of China hawks and in late January was clashing with the administration's health experts over limiting travel from China.\n\nSo it elicited eye rolls when, after initially being prevented from joining the coronavirus task force, he circulated a memo on Jan. 29 urging Mr. Trump to impose the travel limits, arguing that failing to confront the outbreak aggressively could be catastrophic, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses.\n\nThe uninvited message could not have conflicted more with the president's approach at the time of playing down the severity of the threat. And when aides raised it with Mr. Trump, he responded that he was unhappy that Mr. Navarro had put his warning in writing.\n\nFrom the time the virus was first identified as a concern, the administration's response was plagued by the rivalries and factionalism that routinely swirl around Mr. Trump and, along with the president's impulsiveness, undercut decision making and policy development.\n\nFaced with the relentless march of a deadly pathogen, the disagreements and a lack of long-term planning had significant consequences. They slowed the president's response and resulted in problems with execution and planning, including delays in seeking money from Capitol Hill and a failure to begin broad surveillance testing.\n\nThe efforts to shape Mr. Trump's view of the virus began early in January, when his focus was elsewhere: the fallout from his decision to kill Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran's security mastermind; his push for an initial trade deal with China; and his Senate impeachment trial, which was about to begin.\n\nEven after Mr. Azar first briefed him about the potential seriousness of the virus during a phone call on Jan. 18 while the president was at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump projected confidence that it would be a passing problem.\n\n\"We have it totally under control,\" he told an interviewer a few days later while attending the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. \"It's going to be just fine.\"\n\nBack in Washington, voices outside of the White House peppered Mr. Trump with competing assessments about what he should do and how quickly he should act.\n\nThe efforts to sort out policy behind closed doors were contentious and sometimes only loosely organized.\n\nThat was the case when the National Security Council convened a meeting on short notice on the afternoon of Jan. 27. The Situation Room was standing room only, packed with top White House advisers, low-level staffers, Mr. Trump's social media guru, and several cabinet secretaries. There was no checklist about the preparations for a possible pandemic, which would require intensive testing, rapid acquisition of protective gear, and perhaps serious limitations on Americans' movements.\n\nInstead, after a 20-minute description by Mr. Azar of his department's capabilities, the meeting was jolted when Stephen E. Biegun, the newly installed deputy secretary of state, announced plans to issue a \"level four\" travel warning, strongly discouraging Americans from traveling to China. The room erupted into bickering.\n\nA few days later, on the evening of Jan. 30, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff at the time, and Mr. Azar called Air Force One as the president was making the final decision to go ahead with the restrictions on China travel. Mr. Azar was blunt, warning that the virus could develop into a pandemic and arguing that China should be criticized for failing to be transparent.\n\nMr. Trump rejected the idea of criticizing China, saying the country had enough to deal with. And if the president's decision on the travel restrictions suggested that he fully grasped the seriousness of the situation, his response to Mr. Azar indicated otherwise.\n\nStop panicking, Mr. Trump told him.\n\nThat sentiment was present throughout February, as the president's top aides reached for a consistent message but took few concrete steps to prepare for the possibility of a major public health crisis.\n\nDuring a briefing on Capitol Hill on Feb. 5, senators urged administration officials to take the threat more seriously. Several asked if the administration needed additional money to help local and state health departments prepare.\n\nDerek Kan, a senior official from the Office of Management and Budget, replied that the administration had all the money it needed, at least at that point, to stop the virus, two senators who attended the briefing said.\n\n\"Just left the Administration briefing on Coronavirus,\" Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote in a tweet shortly after. \"Bottom line: they aren't taking this seriously enough.\"\n\nThe administration also struggled to carry out plans it did agree on. In mid-February, with the effort to roll out widespread testing stalled, Mr. Azar announced a plan to repurpose a flu-surveillance system in five major cities to help track the virus among the general population. The effort all but collapsed even before it got started as Mr. Azar struggled to win approval for $100 million in funding and the C.D.C. failed to make reliable tests available.\n\nThe number of infections in the United States started to surge through February and early March, but the Trump administration did not move to place large-scale orders for masks and other protective equipment, or critical hospital equipment, such as ventilators. The Pentagon sat on standby, awaiting any orders to help provide temporary hospitals or other assistance.\n\nAs February gave way to March, the president continued to be surrounded by divided factions even as it became clearer that avoiding more aggressive steps was not tenable.\n\nMr. Trump had agreed to give an Oval Office address on the evening of March 11 announcing restrictions on travel from Europe, where the virus was ravaging Italy. But responding to the views of his business friends and others, he continued to resist calls for social distancing, school closures and other steps that would imperil the economy.\n\nBut the virus was already multiplying across the country -- and hospitals were at risk of buckling under the looming wave of severely ill people, lacking masks and other protective equipment, ventilators and sufficient intensive care beds. The question loomed over the president and his aides after weeks of stalling and inaction: What were they going to do?\n\nThe approach that Mr. Azar and others had planned to bring to him weeks earlier moved to the top of the agenda. Even then, and even by Trump White House standards, the debate over whether to shut down much of the country to slow the spread was especially fierce.\n\nAlways attuned to anything that could trigger a stock market decline or an economic slowdown that could hamper his re-election effort, Mr. Trump also reached out to prominent investors like Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of Blackstone Group, a private equity firm.\n\n\"Everybody questioned it for a while, not everybody, but a good portion questioned it,\" Mr. Trump said earlier this month. \"They said, let's keep it open. Let's ride it.\"\n\nIn a tense Oval Office meeting, when Mr. Mnuchin again stressed that the economy would be ravaged, Mr. O'Brien, the national security adviser, who had been worried about the virus for weeks, sounded exasperated as he told Mr. Mnuchin that the economy would be destroyed regardless if officials did nothing.\n\nSoon after the Oval Office address, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a trusted sounding board inside the White House, visited Mr. Trump, partly at the urging of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law. Dr. Gottlieb's role was to impress upon the president how serious the crisis could become. Mr. Pence, by then in charge of the task force, also played a key role at that point in getting through to the president about the seriousness of the moment in a way that Mr. Azar had not.\n\nBut in the end, aides said, it was Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the veteran AIDS researcher who had joined the task force, who helped to persuade Mr. Trump. Soft-spoken and fond of the kind of charts and graphs Mr. Trump prefers, Dr. Birx did not have the rough edges that could irritate the president. He often told people he thought she was elegant.\n\nOn Monday, March 16, Mr. Trump announced new social distancing guidelines, saying they would be in place for two weeks. The subsequent economic disruptions were so severe that the president repeatedly suggested that he wanted to lift even those temporary restrictions. He frequently asked aides why his administration was still being blamed in news coverage for the widespread failures involving testing, insisting the responsibility had shifted to the states.\n\nDuring the last week in March, Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House adviser involved in task force meetings, gave voice to concerns other aides had. She warned Mr. Trump that his wished-for date of Easter to reopen the country likely couldn't be accomplished. Among other things, she told him, he would end up being blamed by critics for every subsequent death caused by the virus.\n\nWithin days, he watched images on television of a calamitous situation at Elmhurst Hospital Center, miles from his childhood home in Queens, N.Y., where 13 people had died from the coronavirus in 24 hours.\n\nHe left the restrictions in place.\n\nMark Walker contributed reporting from Washington, and Mike Baker from Seattle.

And the economic lockdown necessary to achieve social distancing -- as I've been saying, the economy is in the equivalent of a medically induced coma -- has led to almost 17 million new claims for unemployment insurance over the past three weeks, again almost surely an understatement of true job losses.\n\nYet the scariest news of the past week didn't involve either epidemiology or economics; it was the travesty of an election in Wisconsin, where the Supreme Court required that in-person voting proceed despite the health risks and the fact that many who requested absentee ballots never got them.\n\nWhy was this so scary? Because it shows that America as we know it may not survive much longer. The pandemic will eventually end; the economy will eventually recover. But democracy, once lost, may never come back. And we're much closer to losing our democracy than many people realize.\n\nTo see how a modern democracy can die, look at events in Europe, especially Hungary, over the past decade.\n\nPaul Krugman's Newsletter: Get a better understanding of the economy -- and an even deeper look at what's on Paul's mind.\n\nWhat happened in Hungary, beginning in 2011, was that Fidesz, the nation's white nationalist ruling party, took advantage of its position to rig the electoral system, effectively making its rule permanent. Then it further consolidated its control, using political power to reward friendly businesses while punishing critics, and moved to suppress independent news media.\n\nUntil recently, it seemed as if Viktor Orban, Hungary's de facto dictator, might stop with soft authoritarianism, presiding over a regime that preserved some of the outward forms of democracy, neutralizing and punishing opposition without actually making criticism illegal. But now his government has used the coronavirus as an excuse to abandon even the pretense of constitutional government, giving Orban the power to rule by decree.\n\nIf you say that something similar can't happen here, you're hopelessly na\u00efve. In fact, it's already happening here, especially at the state level. Wisconsin, in particular, is well on its way toward becoming Hungary on Lake Michigan, as Republicans seek a permanent lock on power.\n\nThe story so far: Back in 2018, Wisconsin's electorate voted strongly for Democratic control. Voters chose a Democratic governor, and gave 53 percent of their support to Democratic candidates for the State Assembly. But the state is so heavily gerrymandered that despite this popular-vote majority, Democrats got only 36 percent of the Assembly's seats.\n\nAnd far from trying to reach some accommodation with the governor-elect, Republicans moved to effectively emasculate him, drastically reducing the powers of his office.\n\nThen came Tuesday's election. In normal times most attention would have been focused on the Democratic primary -- although that became a moot point when Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign. But a seat on the State Supreme Court was also at stake.\n\nYet Wisconsin, like most of the country, is under a stay-at-home order. So why did Republican legislators, eventually backed by the Republican appointees to the U.S. Supreme Court, insist on holding an election as if the situation were normal?\n\nThe answer is that the state shutdown had a much more severe impact on voting in Democratic-leaning urban areas, where a great majority of polling places were closed, than in rural or suburban areas. So the state G.O.P. was nakedly exploiting a pandemic to disenfranchise those likely to vote against it.\n\nWhat we saw in Wisconsin, in short, was a state party doing whatever it takes to cling to power even if a majority of voters want it out -- and a partisan bloc on the Supreme Court backing its efforts. Donald Trump, as usual, said the quiet part out loud: If we expand early voting and voting by mail, \"you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\"\n\nDoes anyone seriously doubt that something similar could happen, very soon, at a national level?\n\nThis November, it's all too possible that Trump will eke out an Electoral College win thanks to widespread voter suppression. If he does -- or even if he wins cleanly -- everything we've seen suggests that he will use a second term to punish everyone he sees as a domestic enemy, and that his party will back him all the way. That is, America will do a full Hungary.\n\nWhat if Trump loses? You know what he'll do: He'll claim that Joe Biden's victory was based on voter fraud, that millions of illegal immigrants cast ballots or something like that. Would the Republican Party, and perhaps more important, Fox News, support his refusal to accept reality? What do you think?\n\nSo that's why what just happened in Wisconsin scares me more than either disease or depression. For it shows that one of our two major parties simply doesn't believe in democracy. Authoritarian rule may be just around the corner.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

Here's what you need to know:The global toll approached 100,000, as the New York region yet again tallies highest daily death tolls.Shuttered or short of cash, small businesses struggle to survive.California's governor notes a drop in I.C.U. cases but warns that \"one data point is not a trend.\"In Ohio, the Amish help provide medical supplies for hospitals.How many people have died from coronavirus in N.Y.? More than the official count.In Wisconsin, growing pains for voting by mail: 'This has all the makings of a Florida 2000.'What else is happening in the world.The global toll approached 100,000, as the New York region yet again tallies highest daily death tolls.\n\nNever have so many millions so suddenly lost their jobs. Never has the United States government vowed to spend so much money all at once to stave off economic ruin. Still, never has the financial security of so many been in such jeopardy.\n\nBut what's most immediate, never have Americans had to watch so many die day after day, separated from friends and family, the air drained from their lungs by a virus that was first detected in the country less than two months ago.\n\n\"We've lost over 7,000 lives to this crisis,\" said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York. \"That is so shocking and painful and breathtaking, I don't even have the words for it.\"\n\nAround the world, the official death count surged toward 100,000 and public health officials from Paris to Los Angeles said the only way to keep that figure from growing even faster would be to extend the lockdowns.\n\nThe virus has yet to reveal many of its insidious mysteries, but new data and a growing body of research have shown that it preys on the human propensity to connect.\n\nIn one densely crowded, seven-square-mile area in the center of the New York borough of Queens, it took just weeks for the virus to infect thousands. In theory, the pathogen infects princes and paupers alike, but working-class and immigrant communities like the one in Queens have been especially hard hit, exposing the deep inequities in American society and its health care system.\n\nThe swift spread of the virus in locations where people live in cramped quarters has raised concern for vulnerable populations around the world, such as the Roma in Eastern Europe, migrants crowded in camps in Greece and Turkey, indigenous communities in Colombia and those living in the slums of India.\n\nBut it is also behavior -- once common, daily behavior -- that can give the virus life.\n\nA new study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control revealed how one unsuspecting man who attended a dinner, a funeral and a birthday party in Chicago was the likely source of a chain of transmission that would lead to the infection of at least 15 people, three of whom later died.\n\nYet, in Kansas, republican lawmakers blocked efforts by the governor to restrict large gatherings, saying that worshipers should be able to attend Easter services.\n\nIn most of the country, even funerals have been canceled.\n\nIn New York City, gravediggers were busy excavating long trenches to bury hundreds of unclaimed bodies on Hart Island in the Bronx. Since 1869, more than one million men, women and children have been buried anonymously in the island's potter's field.\n\nLong a graveyard of last resort, it will now be a common burial ground for scores lost to the virus who died alone.\n\nCoronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count\n\nA detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county.\n\nShuttered or short of cash, small businesses struggle to survive.\n\nWhen the federal government began rushing trillions of dollars of assistance to Americans crushed by the coronavirus pandemic, the hope was that some of the aid would allow businesses to keep workers on the payroll and cushion employees against job losses.\n\nBut so far, a staggering number of Americans -- more than 16 million -- have lost their jobs amid the outbreak. Businesses continue to fail as retailers, restaurants, nail salons and other companies across the country run out of cash and close up shop.\n\nThere is a growing agreement among many economists that the government's efforts were too small and came too late in the fast-moving pandemic to prevent businesses from abandoning their workers. Federal agencies, working in a prescribed partnership with Wall Street, have proved ill equipped to move money quickly to the places it is needed most.\n\nFlooded by requests for help like never before, a federal program that was supposed to deliver emergency relief to small businesses in just three days has run low on funding and nearly frozen up entirely.\n\nThe initiative, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, is an expansion of an emergency system run by the Small Business Administration that has for years helped companies after natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. To speed billions of dollars in aid, the government directly funds the loans, sparing applicants the step of finding a lender willing to work with them.\n\nBut in the face of the pandemic, the loan program is drowning in requests. Many applicants have waited weeks for approval, and while the program is supposed to offer loans up to $2 million, many recent applicants said the S.B.A. help line had told them that loans would be capped at $15,000 per borrower.\n\nSome businesses now face an existential threat. An analysis by University of Chicago economists of data from Homebase, which supplies scheduling software for tens of thousands of small businesses that employ hourly workers in dining, retail and other sectors, suggests that more than 40 percent of those firms have closed since the crisis began.\n\nThe pandemic could cost the United States a quarter of its restaurants, said Cameron Mitchell, who owns and runs a chain of restaurants. He has furloughed all but six of the company's 4,000 workers.\n\n\"I'm not asking for a handout,\" Mr. Mitchell said, but \"we need some additional help, or else America's not going to have a restaurant industry to come back to.\"\n\nCalifornia's governor notes a drop in I.C.U. cases but warns that \"one data point is not a trend.\"\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California said he was encouraged by -- but not drawing too many conclusions from -- the state's first drop in the number of coronavirus patients who were being treated in intensive care units.\n\nHe said there were 1,132 people receiving intensive care as of Thursday, a 1.9 percent decrease from the day before.\n\n\"One data point is not a trend,\" Mr. Newsom warned. \"One data point is not a headline, so I caution anybody to read too much into that one point of data, but nonetheless it is encouraging.\"\n\nCalifornia's decision to ship hundreds of ventilators to other states this week has been met with alarm by some local officials.\n\nWorkers packed the equipment this week for sending to heavily hit states like New York and New Jersey and wrote messages of support on the boxes. Governor Newsom described the shipments as a loan.\n\nBut in places like Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, officials expressed concern about a \"fragile\" supply chain. Hospitals there were anxiously preparing for a shortage in ventilators, they said.\n\nRiverside County has been among the hardest hit in California, with more than 1,100 cases, at least 32 deaths and an outbreak at a nursing home that forced evacuations this week after a beleaguered and sickened staff failed to show up two days in a row.\n\nCounty officials said this week that the state had denied its request for ventilators, and that a second one was pending.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Newsom sought to allay those concerns and pushed back against the idea that the state was neglecting its own needs.\n\n\"It was the right thing to do, and it was the responsible thing to do as Americans,\" he said. \"We can't just sit on assets when we could save lives in other states.\"\n\nIn Ohio, the Amish help provide medical supplies for hospitals.\n\nFor centuries, the Amish community in central Ohio has been famously isolated from the hustle of the outside world. Homes still lack telephones or computers. Travel is by horse and buggy. Home-sewn clothing remains the norm. And even now, as the coronavirus rages in the country at large, there is resistance from people sustained by communal life to the dictates of social distancing that have brought the economy to a halt -- in Amish country as everywhere else.\n\nBut as the virus creeps ever closer, the Amish community is joining the fight.\n\nOn April 1, John Miller, a manufacturer in Sugarcreek, Ohio, with deep connections to the Amish community of Central Ohio, got a call from Cleveland Clinic. The hospital system was struggling to find protective face masks for its 55,000 employees, plus visitors. Could his team sew 12,000 masks in two days?\n\nMr. Miller appealed to Abe Troyer, a leader in the Amish community. A day later, Mr. Troyer had signed up 60 Amish clothes makers who worked from home, and the Cleveland Clinic's order was soon on its way.\n\nThe Amish are not immune to the virus's rampage. As of Thursday, Holmes County, where the nation's largest Amish community resides, had only three confirmed coronavirus cases, but the pandemic has idled hundreds of Amish craftspeople and artisans, and Amish people do not apply for federal unemployment benefits.\n\nAlmost overnight, however, a group of local industry, community and church leaders has mobilized to sustain Amish households by pivoting to making thousands of face masks and shields, surgical gowns and protective garments from medical-grade materials. When those run scarce, the Amish workers switch to using gaily printed quilting fabric and waterproof house wrap.\n\n\"We consider this a privilege that we can come in here and do something for somebody else who's in need and do it right at home here, and do it safely,\" said Atlee Raber, whose garden furniture business now makes protective face shields.\n\nHow many people have died from coronavirus in N.Y.? More than the official count.\n\nIn the first five days of April, 1,125 people were pronounced dead in their homes or on the street in New York City, more than eight times the deaths recorded during the same period in 2019, according to the Fire Department.\n\nMany of those deaths were probably caused by Covid-19, but were not accounted for in the coronavirus tallies given by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo during his widely watched daily news conferences -- statistics that are viewed as key measures of the impact of the outbreak.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Cuomo said 799 people in New York had died from coronavirus in a single 24-hour period -- more than 33 an hour -- bringing the state's total to 7,067.\n\nBut epidemiologists, city officials and medical personnel say those numbers are likely to be far below the city's actual death toll.\n\nThe data on deaths of people in their homes or on the street shows that the state's statistics do not tell the whole story.\n\nA huge number of people are dying at home with presumed cases of coronavirus, and it does not appear that the state has a clear mechanism for factoring those victims into official death tallies.\n\nIn the last three days, 766 people were found dead in their homes, bringing the total for the first eight days of April to 1,891, according to the city's medical examiner's office. It's likely that many have not been counted in the current tally.\n\nIn Wisconsin, growing pains for voting by mail: 'This has all the makings of a Florida 2000.'\n\nThree tubs of absentee ballots that never reached voters were discovered in a postal center outside Milwaukee. At least 9,000 absentee ballots requested by voters were never sent, and others recorded as sent were never received. Even when voters did return their completed ballots in the mail, thousands were postmarked too late to count -- or not at all.\n\nCracks in Wisconsin's vote-by-mail operation are now emerging after the state's scramble to expand that effort on the fly for voters who feared going to the polls in Tuesday's elections. The takeaways -- that the election network and the Postal Service were pushed to the brink of their capabilities, and that mistakes were clearly made -- are instructive for other states if they choose to broaden vote-by-mail methods without sufficient time, money and planning.\n\nWhat else is happening in the world.What you need to know about masks.\n\nWearing a face covering takes some adjustment. To get the most benefit, you need to wear it consistently and correctly. Here are some pointers.\n\nReporting contributed by William K.

"'It's Hit Our Front Door': Homes for the Disabled See Surge of Covid-19", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe call came on March 24. Bob McGuire, the executive director of CP Nassau, a nonprofit group that cares for the developmentally disabled, received a report from a four-story, colonnaded building in Bayville, N.Y., that houses several dozen residents with severe disabilities ranging from cerebral palsy to autism. For many of them, discussions of social distancing or hand washing are moot.\n\n\"Bob, we're starting to see symptoms,\" Mr. McGuire was told.\n\nFevers were spreading. Within 24 hours, 10 residents were taken to the hospital. Now, little more than two weeks later, 37 of the home's 46 residents have tested positive for the coronavirus. Two are dead; nine remain hospitalized. At least eight members of the staff have tested positive as well.\n\n\"Forgive me if I get emotional,\" Mr. McGuire said in an interview, choking up. \"People discount people with disabilities and presume they understand them when they don't know them. They think their lives are not worth the same as yours or mine, and that's just not true.\"\n\nAs the coronavirus preys on the most vulnerable, it is taking root in New York's sprawling network of group homes for people with special needs.\n\nAs of Monday, 1,100 of the 140,000 developmentally disabled people monitored by the state had tested positive for the virus, state officials said. One hundred five had died -- a rate, far higher than in the general population, that echoes the toll in some nursing homes.\n\nSeparately, a study by a large consortium of private service providers found that residents of group homes and similar facilities in New York City and surrounding areas were 5.34 times more likely than the general population to develop Covid-19 and 4.86 times more likely to die from it. What's more, nearly 10 percent of the homes' residents were displaying Covid-like symptoms but had not yet been tested, according to the consortium, New York Disability Advocates.\n\nTrouble throughout the New York City region -- and, to a lesser extent, the state -- was revealed in interviews with caregivers, parents, advocates and senior officials.\n\nIn Brooklyn, two parents of adult children in a group home said they were unnerved after another resident died in a suspected coronavirus case. \"If it is the virus, what the hell are we going to do?\" one of them said, while adding that the staff \"deserve a lot of credit\" for showing up.\n\nOn Staten Island, three state employees who are direct caregivers said 50 of their roughly 600 colleagues in the borough had tested positive. They described the challenges they faced on the job.\n\n\"One of the individuals here is positive, and his behavior is to get up, to pace, and he wants to give me a hug, shake my hand,\" said one of the caregivers, asking that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Deaths in New York and New Jersey hit one-day highs again. The virus is disproportionately killing blacks and Hispanics in New York. New York City sues three stores it says overcharged for key items.

We're just learning on the fly.\"\n\nIn Manhattan, at the Lexington Parc condominium on East 30th Street, ambulances arrived on three successive days, twice taking away residents of a group home operated in part of the building.\n\nLawrence Smiley, the building's longtime managing agent, expressed frustration that he had not received more information from the organization running the home.\n\n\"They've refused to tell us anything,\" he said, then added: \"I'm a realist. Covid is all over the place.\"\n\nMarco R. Damiani, the chief executive of AHRC New York City, which runs the group home and is one of the state's largest private service providers, said one of the residents had tested positive for coronavirus, while \"the other is back home -- it wasn't Covid-related.\"\n\nOther homes in his network have been harder hit, Mr. Damiani said, particularly two housing the most fragile residents. Three have died at a home in Jamaica, Queens, and two at a facility in East Harlem.\n\n\"We still find it hard to get tests for our population,\" he said. Protective equipment was also \"very difficult to get,\" he said, though that situation was improving. Four staff members from his network have died.\n\nJennifer O'Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, the state agency overseeing the residences, said in a statement that it had \"activated our emergency response team to closely monitor all reports of possible contact within our system across the state.\"\n\n\"All staff are fully trained on infection-control practices,\" she said, and the agency \"has released guidance to staff and voluntary provider agencies regarding visitation and quarantine protocols at our facilities.\"\n\nNew York's system of care for the developmentally disabled has become increasingly decentralized in the decades since scandalous conditions were revealed at the Willowbrook State School, a Staten Island warehouse for thousands of residents. While the move toward smaller settings has probably been helpful in averting even wider spread of the virus, the state's oversight has remained a continuing subject of scrutiny and criticism over the years.\n\nIn interviews, a number of parents and advocates expressed dismay that the state had not moved more quickly to curtail daily excursions for residents, which continued past the middle of March. On March 16, in internal email traffic obtained by The New York Times, a state nurse expressed alarm to the official in charge of Albany-area group homes.\n\n\"I have concerns about many of the individuals on my caseload being exposed on the buses and at their day programs,\" the nurse wrote. \"Are we looking at keeping people home? I was surprised that everyone went to program today as normal!\"\n\nOne of the most outspoken advocates in the state, Michael Carey, whose autistic son was killed in state care in 2007, said the state \"unfathomably continued to send vulnerable and elderly residents to day programs\" after bars and restaurants had closed.\n\nSome advocates also worry that residents may not receive the best hospital care. This week, a leading oversight organization, Disability Rights New York, filed a federal complaint against the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, claiming that state policies treat the developmentally disabled as second-class citizens who will be less likely to get access to ventilators, should there be a shortage. None has been reported, and state officials say new hospitalizations have been declining. Advocacy groups in Alabama, Kansas, Tennessee and Washington State have all filed similar complaints in recent weeks.\n\n\"A real policy prohibiting discrimination in the allocation of ventilators and all health care must be enacted immediately,\" said Timothy A. Clune, the executive director of Disability Rights New York.\n\nA spokeswoman for the state declined to comment on the complaint.\n\nFew in New York's system have been hit harder by the virus than Mr. McGuire and his staff.\n\nOn March 24, he quarantined CP Nassau's group home in Bayville, a village on the North Shore of Long Island. Staff members were asked to report \"with toothbrushes and pillows and hunker down,\" he said. \"Normal was gone. Our staff are usually called direct service providers -- all of a sudden they were lifted up to being essential health care workers.\"\n\nMr. McGuire said his organization had a longstanding relationship with Glen Cove Hospital, part of the Northwell Health system: \"Glen Cove knows our guys,\" he said. But eventually the hospital, like many others, began turning away patients with lesser symptoms.\n\n\"If they didn't have symptoms that were life-threatening, they had to go,\" he said. \"Hospitals got overwhelmed. Nobody's fault. Who could have predicted this?\"\n\nAs a result, symptomatic residents returned home, probably leading to a further increase in cases.\n\nBy March 26, Northwell sent over several nurses in protective gear, who moved through the building conducting tests on both the residents and the staff.\n\nArios Eugene, who manages the residence, called it a \"scary day.\"\n\n\"They came in -- they were dressed in gowns and masks, all dressed up to protect themselves -- and went from room to room,\" he recalled, adding that the gravity of the situation hit him. \"It was real. It was like, 'Oh my God, this is real. It's hit our front door.'\"\n\nSome staff members began crying, and he tried to reassure them.\n\nThe next day, Mr. McGuire, a former caregiver himself, delivered a message to his staff, his hands resting on the knees of his bluejeans. He urged those who had left to return.\n\n\"For those of you who haven't been on the battleground, I will tell you, it's been difficult,\" he said. \"Everybody in this agency does saintly things every day.\"\n\nThere were numerous challenges. Fragile residents had to be left alone at hospitals. James Moran, the chief executive of Care Design, which manages the care of residents in homes across the state, has been working with the state to relax such rules for the developmentally disabled.\n\n\"In many cases they can't speak for themselves, or have anxiety issues, with nobody there who they know who can support them,\" he said.\n\nProtective gear was also in short supply at the Bayville home and throughout the system. Mike Alvaro, treasurer of New York Disability Advocates, said that it was a struggle to ensure \"that the face masks and the gowns and gloves are there,\" and that already stretched budgets were being tested.\n\nOxygen was another challenge.\n\n\"One day, we were fine, and then we were in trouble and we needed oxygen,\" Mr. McGuire said. He consulted with his organization's board and was ultimately able to buy some oxygen from a local welding company. Many remaining residents who had not tested positive were moved out of the house, into a building used for daytime activities.\n\nHe grew emotional talking about his caregivers, whose pay starts at minimum wage. He has put up three large signs outside the residence saying, \"Heroes Work Here.\"\n\n\"We don't hear very much about our staff, and they are first responders, they are heroes, and they need to be recognized,\" he said. \"If we fail, our staff, there's no backup. We're the end of the line.\"\n\nMr. Eugene keeps himself isolated at home from his wife, his adult children and even his dog.\n\n\"Every morning when I wake up, I don't think about it,\" he said. \"This is what we signed for, to take care of people. We know how to do it -- we just have to do it with less people. We're doing the best we can to keep people alive.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_hakim@nytimes.com", "name": "Danny

"title": "Most New York Coronavirus Cases Came From Europe, Genomes Show", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nNew research indicates that the coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case, and that travelers brought in the virus mainly from Europe, not Asia.\n\n\"The majority is clearly European,\" said Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who co-wrote a study awaiting peer review.\n\nA separate team at N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine came to strikingly similar conclusions, despite studying a different group of cases. Both teams analyzed genomes from coronaviruses taken from New Yorkers starting in mid-March.\n\nThe research revealed a previously hidden spread of the virus that might have been detected if aggressive testing programs had been put in place.\n\nOn Jan. 31, President Trump barred foreign nationals from entering the country if they had been in China during the prior two weeks.\n\nIt would not be until late February that Italy would begin locking down towns and cities, and March 11 when Mr. Trump said he would block travelers from most European countries. But New Yorkers had already been traveling home with the virus.\n\n\"People were just oblivious,\" said Adriana Heguy, a member of the N.Y.U. team.\n\nDr. Heguy and Dr. van Bakel belong to an international guild of viral historians. They ferret out the history of outbreaks by poring over clues embedded in the genetic material of viruses taken from thousands of patients.\n\nViruses invade a cell and take over its molecular machinery, causing it to make new viruses.\n\nThe process is quick and sloppy. As a result, new viruses can gain a new mutation that wasn't present in their ancestor. If a new virus manages to escape its host and infect other people, its descendants will inherit that mutation.\n\nTracking viral mutations demands sequencing all the genetic material in a virus -- its genome. Once researchers have gathered the genomes from a number of virus samples, they can compare their mutations.\n\nSophisticated computer programs can then figure out how all of those mutations arose as viruses descended from a common ancestor. If they get enough data, they can make rough estimates about how long ago those ancestors lived. That's because mutations arise at a roughly regular pace, like a molecular clock.\n\nMaciej Boni of Penn State University and his colleagues recently used this method to see where the coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, came from in the first place. While conspiracy theories might falsely claim the virus was concocted in a lab, the virus's genome makes clear that it arose in bats.\n\nThere are many kinds of coronaviruses, which infect both humans and animals. Dr. Boni and his colleagues found that the genome of the new virus contains a number of mutations in common with strains of coronaviruses that infect bats.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. C.D.C. issues new back-to-work guidelines for essential workers. In New York, 'the bad news is actually terrible.' The virus might not fade in warm weather, scientists warn. See more updates Updated 24m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThe most closely related coronavirus is in a Chinese horseshoe bat, the researchers found. But the new virus has gained some unique mutations since splitting off from that bat virus decades ago.\n\nDr. Boni said that ancestral virus probably gave rise to a number of strains that infected horseshoe bats, and perhaps sometimes other animals.\n\n\"Very likely there's a vast unsampled diversity,\" he said.\n\nCopying mistakes aren't the only way for new viruses to arise. Sometimes two kinds of coronaviruses will infect the same cell. Their genetic material gets mixed up in new viruses.\n\nIt's entirely possible, Dr. Boni said, in the past 10 or 20 years, a hybrid virus arose in some horseshoe bat that was well-suited to infect humans, too. Later, that virus somehow managed to cross the species barrier.\n\n\"Once in a while, one of these viruses wins the lottery,\" he said.\n\nIn January, a team of Chinese and Australian researchers published the first genome of the new virus. Since then, researchers around the world have sequenced over 3,000 more. Some are genetically identical to each other, while others carry distinctive mutations.\n\nThat's just a tiny sampling of the full diversity of the virus. As of April 8, there were 1.5 million confirmed cases of Covid-19, and the true total is probably many millions more. But already, the genomes of the virus are revealing previously hidden outlines of its history over the past few months.\n\nAs new genomes come to light, researchers upload them to an online database called GISAID. A team of virus evolution experts are analyzing the growing collection of genomes in a project called Nextstrain. They continually update the virus family tree.\n\nThe deepest branches of the tree all belong to lineages from China. The Nextstrain team has also used the mutation rate to determine that the virus probably first moved into humans from an animal host in late 2019. On Dec. 31, China announced that doctors in Wuhan were treating dozens of cases of a mysterious new respiratory illness.\n\nIn January, as the scope of the catastrophe in China became clear, a few countries started an aggressive testing program. They were able to track the arrival of the virus on their territory and track its spread through their populations.\n\nBut the United States fumbled in making its first diagnostic kits and initially limited testing only to people who had come from China and displayed symptoms of Covid-19.\n\n\"It was a disaster that we didn't do testing,\" Dr. Heguy said.\n\nA few cases came to light starting at the end of January. But it was easy to dismiss them as rare imports that did not lead to local outbreaks.\n\nThe illusion was dashed at the end of February by Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington, and his colleagues.\n\nUsing Nextstrain, they showed that a virus identified in a patient in late February had mutation shared by one identified in Washington on Jan. 20.\n\nThe Washington viruses also shared other mutations in common with ones isolated in Wuhan, suggesting that a traveler had brought the coronavirus from China.\n\nWith that discovery, Dr. Bedford and his colleagues took the lead in sequencing coronavirus genomes. Sequencing more genomes around Washington gave them a better view of how the outbreak there got started.\n\n\"I'm quite confident that it was not spreading in December in the United States,\" Dr. Bedford said. \"There may have been a couple other introductions in January that didn't take off in the same way.\"\n\nAs new cases arose in other parts of the country, other researchers set up their own pipelines. The first positive test result in New York came on March 1, and after a couple of weeks, patients surged into the city's hospitals.\n\n\"I thought, 'We need to do this for New York,'\" Dr. Heguy said.\n\nDr. Heguy and her colleagues found some New York viruses that shared unique mutations not found elsewhere. \"That's when you know you've had a silent transmission for a while,\" she said.\n\nDr. Heguy estimated that the virus began circulating in the New York area a couple of months ago.\n\nAnd researchers at Mt. Sinai started sequencing the genomes of patients coming through their hospital. They found that the earliest cases identified in New York were not linked to later ones.\n\n\"Two weeks later, we start seeing viruses related to each other,\" said Ana Silvia Gonzalez-Reiche, a member of the Mt. Sinai team.\n\nDr. Gonzalez-Reiche and her colleagues found that these viruses were practically identical to viruses found around Europe. They cannot say on what particular flight a particular virus arrived in New York. But they write that the viruses reveal \"a period of untracked global transmission between late January to mid-February.\"\n\nSo far, the Mt. Sinai researchers have identified seven separate lineages of viruses that entered New York and began circulating. \"We will probably find more,\" Dr. van Bakel said.\n\nThe coronavirus genomes are also revealing hints of early cross-country travel.\n\nDr. van Bakel and his colleagues found one New York virus that was identical to one of the Washington viruses found by Dr. Bedford and his colleagues. In a separate study, researchers at Yale found another Washington-related virus. Combined, the two studies hint that the coronavirus has been moving from coast to coast for several weeks.\n\nSidney Bell, a computational biologist working with the Nextstrain team, cautions people not to read too much into these new mutations themselves. \"Just because something is different doesn't mean it matters,\" Dr. Bell said.\n\nMutations do not automatically turn viruses into new, fearsome strains. They often don't bring about any change at all. \"To me, mutations are inevitable and kind of boring,\" Dr. Bell said. \"But in the movies, you get the X-Men.\"\n\nPeter Thielen, a virologist at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, likes to think of the spread of viruses like a dandelion seed landing on an empty field.\n\nThe flower grows up and produces seeds of its own. Those seeds spread and sprout. New mutations arise over the generations as the dandelions fill the field. \"But they're all still dandelions,\" Dr. Thielen said.\n\nWhile the coronavirus mutations are useful for telling lineages apart, they don't have any apparent effect on how the virus works.\n\nThat's good news for scientists working on a vaccine.\n\nVaccine developers hope to fight Covid-19 by teaching our bodies to make antibodies that can grab onto the virus and block its entry into cells.\n\nSome viruses evolve so quickly that they require vaccines that can produce several different antibodies. That's not the case for Covid-19. Like other coronaviruses, it has a relatively slow mutation rate compared to some viruses, like influenza.\n\nAs hard as the fight against it may be, its mutations reveal that things can be a whole lot worse.\n\nOf course, the coronavirus will continue to mutate as long as it still infects people. It's possible that vaccines will have to change to keep up with the virus. And that's why scientists need to keep tracking its history.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType":

wants to know when we are going to be able to leave our homes and reopen the United States. That's the wrong way to frame it.\n\nThe better question is: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\"\n\nAny date that is currently being thrown around is just a guess. It's pulled out of the air.\n\nTo this point, Americans have been reacting, often too late, and rarely with data. Most of us are engaging in social distancing because leaders have seen what's happening in Europe or in New York; they want to avoid getting there; and we don't have the testing available to know where coronavirus hot spots really are.\n\nSince the virus appears to be everywhere, we have to shut everything down. That's unlikely to be the way we'll exit, though.\n\nSome cities or states will recover sooner than others. It's helpful to have criteria by which cities or states could determine they're ready. A recent report by Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out some goal posts.\n\nHospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care.\n\nOther cities and states fear that they will approach New York City's state of crisis. They're trying to increase the number of available beds and ventilators -- as well as doctors, nurses and other health care providers -- to make sure they aren't overwhelmed in their capacity to provide care to all those who need it.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Glimmers of hope, and new challenges, as the world struggles to beat back the virus. A top White House official warned in January that a pandemic could imperil millions of Americans. Britain is gripped by concerns for the health of its prime minister, and questions of succession. See more updates Updated 10m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\nThis is the most immediate bar, and the focus of most public health officials' attention. At the moment, there's no reason to believe any area is over a surge of cases, and analysts' models predict many places won't peak for weeks to come.\n\nA state needs to be able to test at least everyone who has symptoms.\n\nDr. Gottlieb and colleagues estimate that the nation would need to have the capacity to run 750,000 tests a week -- this is after things have calmed down greatly. There are times we might need even more.\n\n\"The 750,000 number should be viewed as a reasonable expectation for when we haven't been having any major pockets or regional outbreaks to manage,\" said Mark McClellan, an author of the report and a professor of business, medicine and policy at Duke. \"If more testing to help contain outbreaks and potential outbreaks is needed, which seems very plausible, especially early on, the number would need to be significantly larger. We'll also have to do some surveillance of people without symptoms, especially in higher-risk settings.\"\n\nA national estimate means less in deciding whether a state can reopen than its local capabilities. A state would need to be sure it could test every single person who might be infected, and have the results in a timely manner. That would be the only way to achieve the next requirement.\n\nThe state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts.\n\nA robust system of contact tracing and isolation is the only thing that can prevent an outbreak and a resulting lockdown from recurring. Every time an individual tests positive, the public health infrastructure needs to be able to determine whom that person has been in close contact with, find those people, and have them go into isolation or quarantine until it's established they aren't infected, too.\n\nThis will be a big challenge for most areas. Other countries have relied on cellphone tracking technology to determine whom people have been near. We don't have anything like that ready, nor is it even clear we'd allow it. The United States also doesn't have enough people working in public health in many areas to carry out this task.\n\nBuilding that capacity will take significant time and money, and the country hasn't even started.\n\nThere must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nBecause it can take up to two weeks for symptoms to emerge, any infections that have already happened can take that long to appear. If the number of cases in an area is dropping steadily for that much time, however, public health officials can be reasonably comfortable that suppression has been achieved, defined by every infected person infecting fewer than one other.\n\nIn suppression, cases will dwindle at an exponential fashion, just as they rose. It's not possible to set a benchmark number for every state because the number of infections that will be manageable in any area depends on the local population and the public health system's ability to handle sporadic cases.\n\n\"We wanted to suggest criteria that would allow locations to safely and thoughtfully begin to reopen, but what that looks like exactly will vary from state to state,\" said Caitlin Rivers, another author of the report and an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"We therefore included some flexibility for jurisdictions to tailor these criteria to their local context.\"\n\nThese four criteria are a baseline. Other experts think we will need to add serological testing, which is different from the viral detection going on now. This type of testing looks for antibodies in the blood that our bodies created to fight the infection, not the infection itself. These tests can be much cheaper and faster than the ones we're currently using to detect the virus in sick people.\n\nTesting for antibodies will tell us how many people in a community have already been infected, as opposed to currently infected, and may also provide information about future immunity.\n\nGregg Gonsalves, a professor of epidemiology and law at Yale, said: \"I'd feel better if we had serological testing, and could preferentially allow those who are antibody positive and no longer infectious to return to work first. The point is, though, that we are nowhere even near accomplishing any of these criteria. Opening up before then will be met with a resurgence of the virus.\"\n\nHe added, \"That's the thing that keeps me up every night.\"\n\nUntil we get a vaccine or effective drug treatments, focusing on these major criteria, and directing efforts toward them, should help us determine how we are progressing locally, and how we might achieve each goal.\n\nIt would also prevent us from offering false hope about when America can start reopening. Instead of guesses, people could have clear answers about when they might be able to go back to a closer-to-normal way of life.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_e_carroll@nytimes.com", "name": "Aaron E.

Outbreak\n\n\u65b0\u51a0\u75c5\u6bd2\u75ab\u60c5\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\n\nHere's what you need to know:Glimmers of hope, and new challenges, as the world struggles to beat back the virus.A top White House official warned in January that a pandemic could imperil millions of Americans.Britain is gripped by concerns for the health of its prime minister, and questions of succession.China reports no new virus deaths for the first time since January.Wisconsin election fight previews battle over virus-era voting.France reports its highest daily death toll as its health minister sounds a warning.For 52 medical students eager to join the fight, graduation comes early.Glimmers of hope, and new challenges, as the world struggles to beat back the virus.\n\nThe grim, grinding news from the worldwide struggle with the coronavirus has begun to be leavened by scattered indications that the spread of the scourge might be slowing.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain remained in intensive care Tuesday morning, New York officials expressed cautious optimism that the state and city might be reaching a turning point, and Italy yet again reported a lower daily death toll. China, where the pandemic began late last year, claimed its first day since January with no coronavirus deaths at all.\n\nWuhan, the Chinese city where the virus first appeared, will lift its lockdown today as other nations began discussing plans to ease restrictions.\n\nBut from London to New York, officials warned that lockdowns and social distancing would need to remain in place for some time to ensure that the first signs of success were not swamped by a resurgence of the pathogen.\n\nInvestors around the world chose to focus on the upside. Wall Street staged a huge rally on Monday, and the gains were expected to continue on Tuesday as global stocks pushed higher.\n\nIn Asia, markets rose on news that Japan would spend some 20 percent of its gross domestic product to stabilize its economy, even as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe prepared to declare a state of emergency after infections surged in Tokyo and Osaka.\n\nBut Britain was dealing with a crisis that sent shudders worldwide, as its prime minister, 55, was moved into intensive care so he would be near a ventilator should his lungs fail. The government admitted that Mr. Johnson's condition had deteriorated significantly.\n\nThe crisis that has engulfed nearly every nation on earth came suddenly, but there were warnings in the early days of the outbreak in China that the contagion could do vast damage.\n\nA top White House adviser starkly warned Trump administration officials in late January that the coronavirus crisis could cost the United States trillions of dollars in lost output and put millions of Americans at risk of illness or death.\n\nSince then, the federal government has been criticized for a halting, contradictory and bumbling response that has resulted in delays in testing, sent hospitals scrambling for critical supplies and left the public confused, frightened and looking for definitive answers.\n\nThe virus has seemed to outpace governments at many steps along the way, and much about it remains a mystery, despite perhaps the largest concentrated global scientific effort in history.\n\nThe fatality rate remains unclear, estimates of the proportion of people contracting the virus who never show symptoms ranges from 25 to 50 percent and there is no clear explanation for why it proves so deadly for some people who are relatively young and previously in good health.\n\nSee How the Coronavirus Death Toll Grew Across the U.S.\n\nThe number of deaths from the virus doubled to more than 10,000 in fewer than five days, and two-thirds of the country's metro areas have had at least one person succumb to the virus.\n\nA top White House official warned in January that a pandemic could imperil millions of Americans.\n\nA top White House adviser starkly warned Trump administration officials in late January that the coronavirus crisis could cost the United States trillions of dollars and put millions of Americans at risk of illness or death.\n\nThe warning, in a memo by Peter Navarro, President Trump's trade adviser, is the highest-level alert known to have circulated inside the West Wing as the administration was taking its first substantive steps to confront a crisis that had already consumed China's leaders and would go on to upend life in Europe and the United States.\n\n\"The lack of immune protection or an existing cure or vaccine would leave Americans defenseless in the case of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak on U.S. soil,\" Mr. Navarro's memo said. \"This lack of protection elevates the risk of the coronavirus evolving into a full-blown pandemic, imperiling the lives of millions of Americans.\"\n\nDated Jan. 29, it came during a period when Mr. Trump was playing down the risks to the United States. He later went on to say that no one could have predicted such a devastating outcome.\n\nMr. Navarro said in the memo that the administration faced a choice about how aggressive to be in containing an outbreak, saying the human and economic costs would be relatively low if it turned out to be a problem along the lines of a seasonal flu.\n\nBut he went on to emphasize that the \"risk of a worst-case pandemic scenario should not be overlooked\" given the information coming from China.\n\nIn one worst-case scenario cited in the memo, more than a half-million Americans could die.\n\nBritain is gripped by concerns for the health of its prime minister, and questions of succession.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain remained in the intensive care unit of a London hospital on Tuesday morning battling coronavirus symptoms, raising questions not just about the state of his health but about who would lead the country, gripped by a major coronavirus outbreak, in his stead if that became necessary.\n\nMr. Johnson was transferred to the intensive care unit on Monday after his illness worsened. Aides said he had been moved in case he needed a ventilator to help his recovery. On Tuesday morning, Michael Gove, a senior minister, noted that Mr. Johnson was not on a ventilator but has received \"oxygen support.\"\n\nAs Britain has no written Constitution and no standard line of succession in the case of illness or death of the head of the government, it was for Mr. Johnson to decide who should stand in for him if he became ill. But the man he nominated, Dominic Raab, has been relatively untested, serving as the country's foreign secretary for less than a year.\n\nWhile Mr. Johnson remains as the head of the government from his hospital bed, the seriousness of his illness means that could change quickly. At a time of extraordinary challenge, Mr. Raab is already serving as chairman of a key committee on the pandemic as the government battles to control the spread of the coronavirus and stabilize an economy hit hard by the lockdown measures it has imposed.\n\nPrevious British prime ministers, including Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher, have had health issues while in power, but had brief periods of absence for planned procedures.\n\nMr. Johnson could be hospitalized for some time, and at a moment when the government must make major decisions about its coronavirus response. Though some British prime ministers have nominated deputies, Mr. Johnson chose not to do so when he took the role last year.\n\nThe last time Britain experienced such a power vacuum was in 1953, when Winston Churchill suffered a stroke and the truth of his condition was kept from the British public.\n\nBefore going into intensive care, Mr. Johnson asked Mr. Raab to stand in for him \"where necessary.\"\n\nMr. Gove -- who has had a lead role in coordinating the government's coronavirus response, including giving interviews on Mr. Johnson's state of health -- announced on Twitter on Tuesday that he was self-isolating. He felt well, he said, but a member of his family showed symptoms of the virus.\n\nChina reports no new virus deaths for the first time since January.\n\nThe authorities in mainland China on Tuesday reported no new coronavirus deaths for the first time since January, just as they planned to further ease a monthslong lockdown in Wuhan, the city where the pandemic began.\n\nWuhan has been slowly returning to a semblance of normalcy in recent weeks. Its subways began running again in late March, and restrictions on outbound travel were scheduled to lift on Wednesday.\n\nAs of Tuesday, China has had 83,654 coronavirus infections since the start of the outbreak, according to official figures collated by The New York Times. At least 3,331 people nationwide have died, with most other patients recovered.\n\nBut many believe the true death toll is far higher. American intelligence officers say that because midlevel officials in Wuhan and elsewhere have lied about infection rates, testing and death counts, even Beijing does not know the full extent of China's outbreak.\n\nThose doubts are rife in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, where officials have suppressed online discussion of fatalities and pushed for quick, quiet burials of coronavirus victims.\n\nOther doubts revolve around how China counts new cases.\n\nThe National Health Commission said on Tuesday that the 32 new confirmed infections it had recorded a day earlier were all imported from abroad.\n\nBut China, unlike other countries, does not include asymptomatic infections in that count. And on Tuesday it recorded 30 new asymptomatic cases, including 18 in Hubei Province. All but nine had been transmitted locally.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 1.3 million people in at least 177 countries.\n\nWisconsin election fight previews battle over virus-era voting.\n\nWisconsin voters will face a choice between protecting their health and exercising their civic duty on Tuesday after state Republican leaders, backed up by a conservative majority on the state's Supreme Court, rebuffed the Democratic governor's attempt to postpone in-person voting in their presidential primary and local elections.\n\nThe political and legal skirmishing throughout Monday was only the first round of an expected national fight over voting rights during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe Republicans' success came at the end of a day that left anxious voters whipsawed between competing claims from Gov. Tony Evers and his opponents in the G.O.P.-controlled State Legislature over how the elections scheduled for Tuesday would proceed. It rattled democracy in a key battleground state already shaken by a fast-growing number of cases of the coronavirus.\n\nThe governor had issued an executive order postponing in-person voting and extending to June the deadline for absentee ballots. But Republican leaders succeeded in getting the state's top court to stay the decree.\n\nAnd in a decision late Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative-leaning majority dealt its own blow to Wisconsin Democrats. In a 5-4 vote, the majority ruled against extending the deadline for absentee voting, saying such a change \"fundamentally alters the nature of the election.\" The court's four liberal members dissented, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing that \"the court's order, I fear, will result in massive disenfranchisement.\"\n\nFrance reports its highest daily death toll as its health minister sounds a warning.\n\nFrance's health minister said on Tuesday that the country had not reached the peak of its epidemic and was \"still in a worsening phase.\" The country has recorded some 74,390 cases in total and 8,911 deaths, with the toll still steadily rising. Monday marked its highest 24-hour death toll yet, with 613 fatalities reported in hospitals.\n\nOlivier V\u00e9ran, the health minister, told the broadcaster BFM TV on Tuesday that a slowdown in the number of additional patients in intensive care was encouraging, but added: \"We are not out of the woods yet.\"\n\n\"Confinement is more necessary than ever,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, told FranceInfo radio on Tuesday that 2 million reusable cloth masks would be handed out to Parisians in the coming days. The masks will be made by about 30 small local companies, Ms. Hidalgo said.\n\nIt was yet another sign of shifting attitudes in France toward wearing masks. Previously, following World Health Organization recommendations, the authorities had said masks were only necessary for health care workers and sick patients, but a growing number of officials have been encouraging people to wear cloth masks or other mouth coverings in public.\n\nOfficials in some cities, like Nice, have said that they would make it mandatory for people leaving their homes to wear a mask.\n\nFor 52 medical students eager to join the fight, graduation comes early.\n\nFrom dorm rooms and apartments, 52 medical students watched video of themselves roll across their screens. Miles away, their proud families followed online. Gazing into webcams, the students pledged the Hippocratic oath in frayed unison, dozens of different starts and voices, all coming to the same point.\n\nThey could get on with doctoring.\n\nOn Friday, a virtual graduation was held over video chat for nearly half the 2020 class at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine. They were two months ahead of schedule. That moment will be repeated in some form at other medical schools in the coming days.\n\nThe more ragged the ritual, the more soul-stirring its core: Young people were stepping up to join others already serving at an hour of crisis, little different than soldiers being deployed in war.\n\n\"The country needs to mobilize people,\" said Dr. Steven Abramson, vice dean of the Grossman school. \"Last time this happened was in World War II, when medical schools were shortened to three years.\"\n\nCelebrate the students today. Remember, too, that they stand as proxies for an entire caste of the essential: doctors, nurses and technicians, of course, but also those who drive buses, pick up garbage, save lives in ambulances, stock grocery shelves, deliver mail, push bins of dirty sheets down corridors, keep the electricity grid humming and the sewer system flowing, and figure out how to make space in hospitals when none is left.\n\nIndia to export hydroxychloroquine, an untested treatment being pushed by President Trump.\n\nIndia appeared to be softening its position on blocking the export of hydroxychloroquine, a drug that President Trump has promoted as a possible treatment for the coronavirus.\n\nIndia is the world's largest producer of hydroxychloroquine, known as HCQ, and the president threatened Monday night to retaliate against India if it did not lift tough export restrictions imposed last month.\n\nMany scientists question if the drug, usually prescribed to treat malaria and rheumatism, actually helps against the coronavirus. But Mr. Trump and others have called it \"a game changer.\"\n\n\"In view of the humanitarian aspects of the pandemic, it has been decided that India would license paracetamol and HCQ in appropriate quantities to all our neighboring countries who are dependent on our capabilities,\" Anurag Srivastava, a spokesman for India's foreign ministry, said on Tuesday. (Paracetemol is the pain reliever usually called acetaminophen or Tylenol in the United States.)\n\n\"We will also be supplying these essential drugs to some nations who have been particularly badly affected by the pandemic,\" Mr. Srivastava said.\n\nIndia's coronavirus cases have been doubling every four days; the number of detected cases has risen above 4,000, and the country remains under a strict lockdown that has kept much of its 1.3 billion people indoors.\n\nConcerns are rising that the lockdown could send India into a deep recession that will hit hundreds of millions of poor people especially hard. The Indian government is now planning to slash the salaries of all members of Parliament, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, by 30 percent.\n\nTrump again misleads on the availability of coronavirus testing.\n\nPresident Trump, at his coronavirus task force briefing, again said the number of coronavirus tests in the United States now exceeded that in other countries, wrongly suggesting that the country was doing a better job of monitoring the spread of the disease than other nations.\n\nThough it is true that the total number of tests in the United States has now edged higher than the number in South Korea last week, America has a much larger population. On a per-capita basis, the United States has tested far fewer people than several other countries.\n\nThere is also substantial local variation, with tests much harder to obtain, on average, in some parts of the United States.\n\nPrivate companies like Quest and LabCorp are now running thousands of tests a day. But demand for testing has overwhelmed many labs and testing sites.\n\nDoctors and officials around the country say that lengthy delays in getting results have persisted and that uneven access to tests has prolonged rationing and hampered patient care. In addition, swabs and chemicals needed to run the tests are in short supply in many of the nation's hot zones.\n\nEven as some European nations record rising death tolls, others begin planning for public life to return.\n\nEven as death tolls are rising in France, rebounding in Spain and have yet to peak in cities across Europe, some countries have begun publicly considering plans to lift restrictions on movement and return to some semblance of normalcy.\n\nSebastian Kurz, the chancellor of Austria, in a Monday news conference introduced a timetable for the country to re-emerge from lockdown that would see some stores reopen after Easter.\n\nAustria has recorded 12,058 confirmed cases and 220 deaths, but with new cases appearing to peak on March 26, the government has begun to plan for a loosening of restrictions. Mr. Kurz pleaded with residents to maintain social distancing rules this week, saying it was crucial.\n\nDenmark will allow its youngest children to return to day care and school starting April 15, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced on Monday, describing the steps as the first phase of the lifting a series of restrictions announced last month.\n\nOther restrictions -- like border closures, and the shuttering of restaurants and other nonessential services -- will remain in place at least another four weeks. A ban on large gatherings was extended through August. Ms. Fredericksen said the relaxing of restrictions was not an easy decision.\n\n\"It's like walking a tightrope: If we stand still, we may fall,\" she said. \"If we go too fast it may soon go wrong.\"\n\nIn Italy, where there is a growing sense that the worst of the epidemic may have passed, officials are weighing the idea of widespread testing for antibodies that would allow workers to return. But elsewhere, officials have stressed that talk of lifting restrictions was premature. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany warned on Monday that it would be \"irresponsible\" to discuss a date for easing measures.\n\n\u00c9douard Philippe, France's prime minister, said last week that it was too early to say precisely when and how easing would happen, adding it was important not to \"ruin the collective effort.\"\n\nCases are spiking in Japan, but its emergency measures are voluntary.\n\nAs Prime Minister Shinzo Abe prepares to declare a state of emergency for Japan's largest population centers, citizens and businesses in cities like Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Kobe and Fukuoka must now decide how to respond.\n\nUnlike in other countries, Mr. Abe does not have the legal power to issue stay-at-home orders or force businesses to close, and he has promised to keep public transit operational.\n\nEven as experts warn that Japan is on the brink of an explosion of infections that could overwhelm its health care system, the government will largely depend on voluntary compliance.\n\nThose covered by the planned emergency declaration -- about 56.1 million people across seven prefectures, or less than half of Japan's total population -- will be strongly urged for the next month to work from home and avoid going out for anything other than essential trips to the market or pharmacy.\n\nUntil now, Japan's health officials have reassured the public that they have prevented the virus from raging out of control, mainly by closing schools, asking organizers of large sports and cultural events to cancel them, and quickly identifying clusters of cases and tracing close contacts to infected people.\n\nBut as Mr. Abe, who also announced an economic stimulus package on Monday that he said was worth nearly $1 trillion, prepares to take the nation's containment measures a step further with an official declaration that is expected Tuesday evening, some experts saw that as a tacit admission that the government's previous approach was no longer working.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, Japan had confirmed a total of 3,906 cases and 80 deaths from the coronavirus.\n\nHere's how to help from home.\n\nSitting at home, it's easy to feel like there's nothing you can do to help those on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. But there are many things you can do to help medical professionals, the people affected directly by the virus and your local businesses.\n\nNew Zealand's health minister says he is an 'idiot' for flouting social distancing rules.\n\nAs people across the world are under pressure to follow strict lockdown measures, government officials might be having a hard time following their own advice.\n\nOnly days after Scotland's chief medical officer resigned for flouting social distancing rules, New Zealand's health minister, David Clark, called himself an \"idiot\" on Tuesday for failing more than once to adhere to the country's lockdown.\n\nMr. Clark admitted to driving his family to a park near their house to ride a mountain bike after a photo of his van parked there was published by local outlets on Thursday.\n\nBut that wasn't the first time he bent the lockdown rules that his government announced last month, when New Zealand declared its second ever state of national emergency.\n\nMr. Clark said in a statement on Tuesday that late last month he had driven his family to a beach about 12 miles away from their house so that they would take a walk.\n\n\"This trip was a clear breach of the lockdown principles of staying local and not driving long distances to reach recreation spots,\" he said, adding that he disclosed that trip to Jacinda Ardern, the country's prime minister, and offered his resignation.\n\n\"I've been an idiot, and I understand why people will be angry with me,\" he said.\n\nBut Ms. Ardern did not immediately accept Mr. Clark's resignation, hoping to avoid disrupting the health sector and the government's response to the coronavirus crisis.\n\nNew Zealand has recorded 1,160 cases of infection and one death.\n\nChaos at Afghan-Pakistan border overwhelms screening efforts.\n\nIn Afghanistan, thousands of people flooded through the border with Pakistan on Tuesday in chaotic scenes that overwhelmed any screening measures to identify coronavirus cases and slow the spread of the disease.\n\nThe country's weak management of borders has been a major issue. Even as the virus spread in neighboring Iran, hundreds of thousands of people still made it back to Afghanistan through its western borders, before spreading across the country. Now the rush of returnees from Pakistan, where nearly 4,000 cases have been confirmed, has exacerbated fears. By Tuesday morning, Afghanistan had reported 423 cases of coronavirus -- but officials warn those numbers could not be an authentic indication of the spread, with testing starting late and remaining limited.\n\nThe border with Pakistan, shut for weeks, was temporarily opened on Monday to allow measured return of Afghans stuck on the other side. On the first day, officials even showed pictures of circles drawn on the ground to enforce distancing as returnees were checked to see if they had any symptoms. But early on Tuesday, the scenes were chaotic.\n\n\"Between 8,000 and 10,000 people rushed in all at once,\" said Rahat Gul Ziarmal, the mayor in the border town of Torkham.\n\nA rebellion in Idaho threatens to undermine coronavirus orders.\n\nIn a state with pockets of deep wariness about both big government and mainstream medicine, the sweeping restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the virus have run into outright rebellion in some parts of Idaho, which is facing its own worrying spike in coronavirus cases.\n\nThe opposition is coming not only from people like Ammon Bundy, whose armed takeover of the Oregon refuge with dozens of other men and women in 2016 led to a 41-day standoff, but also from some state lawmakers and a county sheriff who are calling the governor's statewide stay-at-home order an infringement on individual liberties.\n\nHealth care providers and others have been horrified at the public calls to countermand social-distancing requirements, warning that failing to take firm measures could overwhelm Idaho's small hospitals and put large numbers of people at risk of dying.\n\nMany of the latest claims about the Constitution have come from Idaho's northern panhandle, where vaccination rates for other diseases have always been low and where wariness of government is high.\n\nAt a time when health officials say social-distancing measures are vital to avert catastrophic outbreaks of the kind that could overwhelm hospitals -- as happened in Italy -- Idaho's tensions threaten to undermine compliance. While the state was one of the last in the country to identify a coronavirus case, it now has far more cases per capita than California. Blaine County, which includes the popular Sun Valley ski resort, now has the largest per capita concentration of coronavirus cases in the nation.\n\nSuggestion that vaccines be tested in Africa is condemned by the W.H.O.\n\nThe director general of the World Health Organization has denounced as \"racist\" the remarks of two French doctors who suggested a potential vaccine for the coronavirus be tested in Africa.\n\nDuring the organization's coronavirus briefing on Monday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was \"appalled\" by the comments from the scientists at a time when there was need for global \"solidarity\" to defeat the march of the coronavirus pandemic. The comments, made during a discussion on French television last week, were centered on the launch of trials in Europe and Australia to see if a tuberculosis vaccine could be used to treat the coronavirus.\n\n\"If I can be provocative, shouldn't we be doing this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatments, no intensive care?\" Jean-Paul Mira, head of intensive care at Cochin hospital in Paris, said. \"A bit like as it is done elsewhere for some studies on Aids. In prostitutes, we try things because we know that they are highly exposed and that they do not protect themselves.\"\n\nCamille Locht, research director at France's national health institute, Inserm, agreed, saying: \"You are right. We are in the process of thinking about a study in parallel in Africa.\"\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Tedros called those comments a \"disgrace\" and condemned them \"in the strongest terms possible.\"\n\n\"Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine,\" he said. \"We will follow all the rules to test any vaccine or therapeutics all over the world using exactly the same rule.\"\n\n\"The hangover from colonial mentality has to stop,\" he said.\n\nA health official from the Democratic Republic of Congo last week stirred controversy after saying the country would participate in any future coronavirus vaccine tests.\n\nMore than 50 African states have so far reported a total of over 10,000 cases and 487 deaths, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As the cases have spread, nations like South Africa have introduced total lockdowns, limited movement within the country like Kenya or imposed night curfews like Egypt. Protesters in Ivory Coast have destroyed a coronavirus treatment center, saying it was too close to their homes.\n\nTurkey orders all citizens to wear masks as infections surge.\n\nTurkey has ordered all citizens to wear masks when shopping or visiting crowded public places and announced it will start to deliver masks to every family, free of charge, as coronavirus infections sharply increase in the country of 80 million.\n\nTurkey has over 30,000 confirmed cases of the virus and has registered 649 deaths. More than 1,300 patients are in intensive care units and at least 600 medical workers have been infected, according to figures released by the Health Ministry.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases places Turkey among the top 10 currently worst affected countries, a sharp rise since its first confirmed death from the disease on March 17.\n\nHealth Minister Fahrettin Koca, however, said on Monday that the increase in confirmed cases was low when compared with the increase in testing, which has been ramped up to more than 20,000 per day.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has introduced gradual measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, asking people to stay at home and imposing a curfew on those over 65 and under 20, but resisting a nationwide lockdown.\n\nOpposition politicians, including the mayors of two of the biggest cities, Ankara and Istanbul, which have been among the hardest hit by the virus, have called for stricter measures, but Mr. Erdogan has allowed industry, construction firms and public transport to continue working.\n\n\"Turkey's situation concerning urgent needs, from health to food and cleaning material, is very good,\" Mr. Erdogan said in an address to the nation on Monday. \"We not only have the ability to overcome this epidemic, but also the morale and determination.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Carlotta Gall, Aurelien Breeden, Martin Selsoe Sorensen, Christopher F.

"Chernobyl Wildfires Reignite, Stirring Up Radiation", "body": "VINNYTSIA, Ukraine -- Firefighters have struggled to control wildfires burning through radioactive forest in the abandoned territory around the Chernobyl nuclear plant, where radiation levels are considerably lower than they were immediately after the 1986 accident but still pose risks.\n\nRadiation readings near the wildfires, where smoke is swirling about, have been elevated, with the wind blowing toward rural areas of Russia and Belarus for most of the past week. The wind shifted Friday toward Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, but authorities say the radiation level is still normal in the city, whose population is about three million.\n\nBut Saturday's strong winds could spread the fires to the remnants of the nuclear plant and the equipment that was used to clean up the disaster, said Kateryna Pavlova, the acting head of the agency that oversees the area, in a telephone interview. \"At the moment, we cannot say the fire is contained,\" Ms. Pavlova said.\n\nAfter the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, authorities created an area around the plant known as the Zone of Alienation, a rough circle with a nearly 18-mile radius, fenced off with barbed wire. Access to the zone is limited to workers who manage the site and tourists who take guided excursions.\n\nOver time, radiation has settled into the soil, where its half-life ticks away mostly harmlessly. But the roots of moss, trees and other vegetation have absorbed some radiation, bringing it to the surface and spreading radioactive particles in smoke when it burns.\n\nAlready in lockdown because of the coronavirus, Ukraine is now also contending with fires in the post-apocalyptic landscape of the Chernobyl zone.\n\nWildfires break out there often but the blazes burning through dry grass and pine forests this spring, after a warm and dry winter, are far larger than the typical brush fires in the Chernobyl zone.\n\nThe Exclusion Zone Management Agency, the government office that manages the site, said the fires have burned through more than 8,600 acres over the past week. By Saturday, about 400 firefighters, 100 fire engines and several helicopters had been deployed to the exclusion zone.\n\nAccording to the state center of radiation and nuclear safety, contaminated smoke is expected to reach Kyiv this weekend. However, the radiation level in the air, once smoke has disbursed far from the fires, is considered safe. It is expected to be about a hundredth of the level deemed an emergency.\n\nThe Exclusion Zone Management Agency is trying to protect critical infrastructure in the Chernobyl zone, such as the plant itself and the so-called \"graves,\" or parking lots of abandoned, highly contaminated trucks and tracked vehicles that were left from the original disaster, officials said.\n\n\"We have been working all night digging firebreaks around the plant to protect it from fire,\" Ms. Pavlova said.\n\nThe cause has not been determined. One possibility is that a fire started intentionally by farmers to clear stubble from nearby fields had spread into the zone.\n\nThe Zone of Alienation is an eerie landscape of abandoned villages, equipment \"graves,\" empty fields and dense pine and birch forests, set aside in perpetuity as an experiment in mitigating nuclear disaster. The idea was to limit, through isolation, the lethality of radiation.\n\nThe danger is minimal today. Scientists say the average radiation level in the zone is about a quarter as harmful to human health as it was in the immediate aftermath of the explosion and fire.\n\nRadioactive elements degrade at predictable intervals, called half-lives, that can vary enormously. The average particle half-life at Chernobyl is about 30 years.\n\nThe main risk from the fires comes from inhaling, via the smoke, small radioactive particles thrown years ago from the open core of the Chernobyl reactor, said Olena Miskun, an air pollution expert with Ecodiya, an environmental advocacy group.\n\n\"Wind can raise hot particles in the air together with the ash and blow it toward populated areas,\" Ms. Miskun says. Also, radioactive particles can land on gardens or fields and later be consumed in food.\n\n\"We are lucky to have quarantine measures in place now,\" she said. \"People stay at home, walk less and wear masks,\" anyway, because of the coronavirus threat.\n\nAndrew E.

Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nAdd another public health crisis to the toll of the new coronavirus: Mounting data suggests that domestic abuse is acting like an opportunistic infection, flourishing in the conditions created by the pandemic.\n\nThere was every reason to believe that the restrictions imposed to keep the virus from spreading would have such an effect, said Marianne Hester, a Bristol University sociologist who studies abusive relationships. Domestic violence goes up whenever families spend more time together, such as the Christmas and summer vacations, she said.\n\nNow, with families in lockdown worldwide, hotlines are lighting up with abuse reports, leaving governments trying to address a crisis that experts say they should have seen coming.\n\nThe United Nations called on Sunday for urgent action to combat the worldwide surge in domestic violence. \"I urge all governments to put women's safety first as they respond to the pandemic,\" Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres wrote on Twitter.\n\nBut governments largely failed to prepare for the way the new public health measures would create opportunities for abusers to terrorize their victims. Now, many are scrambling to offer services to those at risk.\n\nBut, as with the response to the virus itself, the delays mean that irreparable harm may already have occurred.\n\nLockdown and 'Intimate Terrorism'\n\nAs cities and towns across China locked down, a 26-year-old woman named Lele found herself entangled in more and more arguments with her husband, with whom she now had to spend every hour in their home in Anhui Province, in eastern China.\n\nOn March 1, while Lele was holding her 11-month-old daughter, her husband began to beat her with a high chair. She is not sure how many times he hit her. Eventually, she says, one of her legs lost feeling and she fell to the ground, still holding the baby in her arms.\n\nA photograph she took after the incident shows the high chair lying on the floor in pieces, two of its metal legs snapped off -- evidence of the force with which her husband wielded it against her. Another image documents Lele's injuries: Nearly every inch of her lower legs was covered in bruises, a huge hematoma blooming on her left calf.\n\nLele -- her full name is not being used for her safety -- said that her husband had abused her throughout their six-year relationship, but that the Covid-19 outbreak made things far worse.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Hospitals face severe shortages of critical supplies, according to a new government report.

See more updates Updated 29m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\n\"During the epidemic, we were unable to go outside, and our conflicts just grew bigger and bigger and more and more frequent,\" she said. \"Everything was exposed.\"\n\nAs quarantines take effect around the world, that kind of \"intimate terrorism\" -- a term many experts prefer for domestic violence -- is flourishing.\n\nIn China, a Beijing-based NGO dedicated to combating violence against women, Equality, has seen a surge in calls to its help line since early February, when the government locked down cities in Hubei Province, then the outbreak's epicenter.\n\nIn Spain, the emergency number for domestic violence received 18 percent more calls in the first two weeks of lockdown than in the same period a month earlier.\n\n\"We've been getting some very distressing calls, showing us clearly just how intense psychological as well as physical mistreatment can get when people are kept 24 hours a day together within a reduced space,\" said Ana Bella, who set up a foundation to help other women after surviving domestic violence herself.\n\nOn Thursday, the French police reported a nationwide spike of about 30 percent in domestic violence. Christophe Castaner, the French interior minister, said he had asked officers to be on the lookout for abuse.\n\n\"The risk increases due to confinement,\" he said in an interview on French television.\n\nNo Escape\n\nIn Spain, with the help of women's associations, The New York Times contacted women stuck at home with an abusive husband or partner and conducted interviews over WhatsApp.\n\nOne of them, Ana -- who asked that her full name be withheld -- shares an apartment with her partner, and says he has been regularly abusing her. He insists on total surveillance at all times. If she tries to lock herself in a room, he kicks the door until she opens it.\n\n\"I can't even have privacy in the bathroom -- and now I have to endure this in a lockdown,\" she wrote in a message sent late at night, to hide the communication from her husband.\n\nJudith Lewis Herman, a renowned trauma expert at Harvard University Medical School, has found that the coercive methods domestic abusers use to control their partners and children \"bear an uncanny resemblance\" to those kidnappers use to control hostages and repressive regimes use to break the will of political prisoners.\n\n\"The methods which enable one human being to control another are remarkably consistent,\" she wrote in a widely cited 1992 journal article. \"While perpetrators of organized political or sexual exploitation may instruct each other in coercive methods, perpetrators of domestic abuse appear to reinvent them.\"\n\nIn addition to physical violence, which is not present in every abusive relationship, common tools of abuse include isolation from friends, family and employment; constant surveillance; strict, detailed rules for behavior; and restrictions on access to such basic necessities as food, clothing and sanitary facilities.\n\nHome isolation, however vital to the fight against the pandemic, is giving still more power to the abuser, Dr. Hester said. \"If suddenly people have got to be at home,\" she said, \"that gives him an opportunity, suddenly, to call the shots around that. To say what she should be doing or shouldn't.\"\n\nThe isolation has also shattered support networks, making it far more difficult for victims to get help or escape.\n\nFragile resources, overwhelmed\n\nAfter her husband attacked her with the high chair, Lele limped to the next room and called the police. When they arrived, however, they only documented the attack, then took no further action.\n\nNext, she hired a lawyer and filed for divorce -- only to find that the epidemic had cut off that avenue of escape, too. Her divorce proceeding was postponed until April. She is still waiting for the court's decision.\n\nAnd finding a new home amid the outbreak proved difficult, forcing Lele and her daughter to continue to live with their abuser for weeks.\n\nIt is a pattern playing out around the world.\n\nInstitutions that are supposed to protect women from domestic violence, many weak and underfunded to begin with, are now straining to respond to the increased demand.\n\nFeng Yuan, a co-founder of Equality, the Chinese advocacy group, said she had one client who called an emergency line only to be told the police were too overstretched to help her. \"We can come to your place after the crisis,\" she recounted the operator saying.\n\nIn Europe, one country after another seems to have followed the same grim path: First, governments impose lockdowns without making sufficient provisions for domestic abuse victims. About 10 days later, distress calls spike, setting off a public outcry. Only then do the governments scramble to improvise solutions.\n\nItaly was first.\n\nIts lockdown began in early March. Soon after that, domestic violence reports began to rise, but there was nowhere for newly desperate women to go. Shelters could not take them because the risk of infection was too great.\n\nSo the government said local authorities could requisition hotel rooms to serve as makeshift shelters where victims could quarantine safely.\n\nSpain announced its lockdown on March 14; France's began three days later. About two weeks later, with abuse reports soaring, officials there announced that they, too, planned to turn vacant hotel rooms into shelters, among other emergency efforts.\n\nIn Britain, the authorities waited longer before imposing a lockdown.\n\nTen days before it began on March 23, The New York Times contacted the Home Office about what it planned to do about domestic violence. The response: Only \"existing sources of advice and support\" would be available. The government later published a list of hotlines and apps that victims could use to call for help, but only one was specifically tailored for the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nBy a week into lockdown, Avon and Somerset, in the southwest of the country, said domestic abuse reports were already up by 20 percent, and local forces elsewhere were bracing for the same.\n\nLast week, after dozens of civic groups signed an open letter to the government calling for action, officials pledged to respond, without offering specifics.\n\n\"Supporting victims of domestic abuse is a priority for the home secretary, and she is fully aware of the distress and anxiety this period may cause to those suffering or at risk of domestic abuse,\" the Home Office said in a statement. \"We are working with the police, domestic abuse charities, help lines and front-line workers to support and protect people,.\"\n\nIt also said victims could \"disregard orders to stay at home if they need to seek immediate refuge.\"\n\nEventually, the lockdowns will end. But as the confinement drags on, the danger seems likely to intensify. Studies show that abusers are more likely to murder their partners and others in the wake of personal crises, including lost jobs or major financial setbacks.\n\nWith Covid-19 ravaging the economy, such crises are set to become much more frequent.\n\nReporting was contributed by Raphael Minder from Spain, Vivian Wang from Hong Kong, Constant M\u00e9heut from France and Elisabetta Povoledo from

manufacturer here with deep connections to the close-knit Amish community of Central Ohio, got a call from Cleveland Clinic. The hospital system was struggling to find protective face masks for its 55,000 employees, plus visitors. Could his team sew 12,000 masks in two days?\n\nHe appealed to Abe Troyer with Keim, a local lumber mill and home goods business and a leader in the Amish community: \"Abe, make a sewing frolic.\" A frolic, Mr. Miller explained, \"is a colloquial term here that means, 'Get a bunch of people. Throw a bunch of people at this.'\"\n\nA day later, Mr. Troyer had signed up 60 Amish home seamstresses, and the Cleveland Clinic sewing frolic was on.\n\nFor centuries, the Amish community has been famously isolated from the hustle of the outside world. Homes still lack telephones or computers. Travel is by horse and buggy. Home-sewn clothing remains the norm. And even now, as the coronavirus rages in the country at large, there is resistance from people sustained by communal life to the dictates of social distancing that have brought the economy to a halt -- in Amish country as everywhere else.\n\nBut as the virus creeps ever closer, the Amish community is joining the fight.\n\n\"If there is a need, people just show up,\" said Mr. Troyer, a man in his 40s with a gray-streaked beard and a mild German accent.\n\nThe Amish are not immune from the coronavirus's rampage. As of Thursday, Holmes County, where the nation's largest Amish community resides, had only three confirmed coronavirus cases, but the pandemic has idled hundreds of Amish seamstresses, craftsmen and artisans, and Amish people do not apply for federal unemployment benefits.\n\n\"It conflicts with our faith and our commitment to the government,\" said Atlee Raber, who founded Berlin Gardens, an area garden furniture maker that now makes protective face shields.\n\nAlmost overnight, a group of local industry, community and church leaders has mobilized to sustain Amish households by pivoting to work crafting thousands of face masks and shields, surgical gowns and protective garments from medical-grade materials. When those run scarce, they switch to using gaily printed quilting fabric and waterproof Tyvek house wrap.\n\n\"We consider this a privilege that we can come in here and do something for somebody else who's in need and do it right at home here, and do it safely,\" Mr. Raber said, instead of \"taking handouts.\"\n\nMr. Miller, who is president of both Superb Industries, a manufacturer in Sugarcreek with medical, automotive and commercial clients, and Stitches USA, a commercial sewing operation, calls March 16 \"Black Monday.\" That's when social distancing guidelines laid waste to Holmes County's economy. It's also the day he convened a conference call with Developing Excellence, an area business group, to discuss the damage. Member businesses employ about 6,000 people, the majority of them Amish. Three days later, Mr. Miller created \"Operation Stop Covid-19.\"\n\n\"I thought if we could pool resources and leverage the much needed technical skill of sewing that is literally lying latent in this community, we could do a lot,\" Mr. Miller said.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. As millions more Americans lose their jobs, more aid from Washington is uncertain. European officials agree to spend more than half a trillion euros to blunt the economic effects from the virus. OPEC and Russia reach a deal to cut oil production, as the pandemic drives down demand. See more updates Updated 18m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nWith area businesses, he set up a website and enlisted emergency workers from Sugarcreek Fire & Rescue to model prototypes of N95 mask covers, fluid-resistant gowns sewn of tarp material from Zinck's Fabric Outlet in Sugarcreek, and boot covers made of Tyvek from Keim, in nearby Charm, Ohio.\n\nKeim's Amish millworkers built hardwood dividers for field hospitals in New York, the meticulous workmanship belying their temporary purpose. Berlin Gardens, which normally makes garden furniture from recycled plastic milk jugs, completed their first order of 20,000 plastic face shields for Yale New Haven Hospital last month.\n\n\"We're close to 100,000 a day,\" Sam Yoder, the current owner of Berlin Gardens, said last Friday. \"It almost covers our payroll. Not quite.\"\n\nWhile they work, the Amish employees are largely observing social distancing guidelines, but face masks are less popular.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic order in particular holds special significance. The medical system's Union Hospital is just 11 miles from Sugarcreek.\n\n\"Cleveland Clinic has been here for us,\" Mr. Miller said. \"They saved my mom's life many times.\"\n\nWhen the request from Cleveland came on April 1, Keim pledged its help, including with order and delivery logistics. The next morning, Mike Spence, who leads Superb's marketing operation, met Sarah Stamp, the general manager for innovations at Cleveland Clinic, on the side of Interstate 77, halfway between Cleveland and Sugarcreek. He brought a prototype mask with him.\n\n\"They said 'roll,'\" Mr. Miller recalled, and the sewing frolic began.\n\nAbe Troyer went home that night carrying three heavy spools of wire. After dinner, he gave the wire, scissors and a yardstick to four of his five daughters -- Suetta, Mabel, Joanne, and Linda -- and told them to cut seven-inch lengths for the masks' nose clips. Then Mr. Troyer, Keim's sales director, used his work cell -- a flip phone whose ringtone plays \"Amazing Grace\" -- to relay to others in the community that the hospital in Cleveland needed thousands of masks immediately.\n\nBy evening's end, Mr. Troyer's daughters had slid the three wire spools onto a broomstick wedged between two ladderback chairs and cut 20,000 nose clips.\n\nMr. Miller arrived around 9 p.m. at the Troyers' home with more supplies. Entering their tidy kitchen with its beadboard wainscoting and a painting of a solitary tree on one wall, Mr. Miller was perplexed. \"Abe had told me he's got six people in his home that can sew. And I said, 'Have you sewn any?'\"\n\nRosie Troyer, Mr. Troyer's wife, told Mr. Miller, \"We're not going to sew any, because my husband still works. We're giving these to people who don't have a job.\" Mr. Troyer, who does not drive, jumped into Mr. Miller's car. The pandemic had financially wounded Amish families to such an extent that, within one two-mile stretch, they dropped off mask-making kits at eight homes.\n\nEach kit contains materials for 500 masks \"and a warning that says 'The Surgeon General of the United States has said that you have to wear a mask when you're making these,'\" Mr. Miller said. \"So the first thing you do is sew one to wear.\"\n\nSimrit Sandhu, the chief supply chain officer for the Cleveland Clinic, said the traditional channels for health care supplies had dried up amid the pandemic.\n\n\"The need to find local solutions has become more important than ever before,\" she said. \"This was timing and relationships coming together as our need went up exponentially.\"\n\nWith raw materials difficult to secure, Amish seamstresses came up with a more efficient mask design. Mr. Miller met a clinic manager at the nearby Akron-Canton Airport, laying samples of the new mask on the hood of her Mazda for approval.\n\nCleveland Clinic has since increased its order to 10,000 masks a day, Ms. Sandhu said, and has also ordered protective gowns.\n\nAmish leaders are aware that the coronavirus poses a threat to their deeply communal way of life. How to change those traditions is another matter.\n\n\"More people are becoming aware of it, seeing a risk, but maybe not as fast as the outside world,\" said Leroy Yoder, an Amish bishop. \"People think that compared to other people, it's nothing to worry about. But if we have to add names to the numbers, then it's going to become real, but then it's going to be too late.\"\n\nOn March 16, Ohio public health officials advised against gatherings of 10 people or more, and four days later, Ohio's Amish steering committee advised all church districts to pay heed. The committee recommended stopping church services and urged Amish Ohioans \"to cancel or postpone weddings, youth and family gatherings until further notice.\"\n\nBut last Friday, black horse-drawn buggies clustered around a building in Holmes County. Inside, about 100 people gathered for a post-funeral meal. A church elder emerged and explained that he was spacing mourners four to an eight-foot table, and \"normally, 400 or 500 people would attend an Amish funeral.\"\n\nThe Budget, a local weekly newspaper, has devoted more than 50 pages to dispatches from Amish communities across the country struggling to reconcile social distancing with a way of life that survives through communal work and worship, with services held in homes and barns.\n\n\"Coronavirus flu is probably the main talk worldwide. Let's remember to pray for the leaders of the world,\" read a missive from Mount Hope, Ohio, after describing a church service attended by more than a dozen families \"and some young folks.\"\n\n.\n\nThe Cleveland project is a constant reminder of the disease, but the Amish still grapple with its implications. David Kline, an author and Amish bishop who still lives on the farm in Holmes County where he was born, recalled one of his children telling him that someone invited a youth group of 200 to assemble the face masks -- and then someone else remembered the guidelines.\n\n\"I think it's a time to pause and do some inventory on ourselves,\" he said. \"Sometimes it's good to find out that we aren't in control of everything.\"\n\nFrom her sunny sewing room outside Charm, Gladys Beachy will coordinate nine women, including her widowed mother, who will sew 500 masks each. She can't help thinking that holding \"a quilting\" would make the repetitive job more interesting for all of them.\n\nVarious upcoming events -- Easter services, spring church communion service, her neighbor's wedding -- are all canceled or delayed. \"Even my family's cutting back,\" she said. \"We're 16 right now and we can't all get together at once. So that'll be different -- well, for the next couple of weeks, hopefully.\"\n\nAnyone who gets sick cannot work on the project. Jim Smucker, president of Keim, said the company has tucked warnings about Covid-19 into the paycheck envelopes of his 500 employees, including a New York Times story about a funeral that spread the disease in Albany, Ga.\n\n\"We're a very individualistic society and the Amish have a lot to teach us about community,\" said Mr. Smucker, who was raised in a Mennonite household. Amid a pandemic, \"I think the shift has got to go from 'I,' to 'we.'\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"Ignoring Expert Opinion, Trump Again Promotes Use of Hydroxychloroquine", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nPresident Trump doubled down Sunday on his push for the use of an anti-malarial drug against the coronavirus, issuing medical advice that goes well beyond scant evidence of the drug's effectiveness as well as the advice of doctors and public health experts.\n\nMr. Trump's recommendation of hydroxychloroquine, for the second day in a row at a White House briefing, was a striking example of his brazen willingness to distort and outright defy expert opinion and scientific evidence when it does not suit his agenda.\n\nStanding alongside two top public health officials who have declined to endorse his call for widely administering the drug, Mr. Trump suggested that he was speaking on gut instinct and acknowledged that he had no expertise on the subject.\n\nSaying that the drug is \"being tested now,\" Mr. Trump said that \"there are some very strong, powerful signs\" of its potential, although health experts say that the data is extremely limited and that more study of the drug's effectiveness against the coronavirus is needed.\n\n\"But what do I know? I'm not a doctor,\" Mr. Trump added.\n\n\"If it does work, it would be a shame we did not do it early,\" Mr. Trump said, noting again that the federal government had purchased and stockpiled 29 million pills of the drug. \"We are sending them to various labs, our military, we're sending them to the hospitals.\"\n\nMr. Trump, who once predicted that the virus might \"miraculously\" disappear by April because of warm weather, and who has rejected scientific consensus on issues like climate change, was undaunted by skeptical questioning.\n\n\"What do you have to lose?\" Mr. Trump asked, for the second day in a row, saying that terminally ill patients should be willing to try any treatment that has shown some promise.\n\nWhen a reporter at Sunday's briefing asked Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to weigh in on the subject, Mr. Trump stopped him from answering. As the reporter noted that Dr. Fauci, who has been far more skeptical about the drug's potential, was the president's medical expert, Mr. Trump made it clear he did not want the doctor to answer.\n\n\"You know how many times he's answered that question? Maybe 15 times,\" the president said, stepping toward the lectern where Dr. Fauci was standing.\n\nEven as Mr. Trump has promoted the drug, which is also often prescribed for patients with lupus, it has created rifts within his own coronavirus task force. And while many hospitals have chosen to use hydroxychloroquine in a desperate attempt to treat dying patients who have few other options, others have noted that it carries serious risks. In particular, the drug can cause a heart arrhythmia that can lead to cardiac arrest.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak Trump again promotes use of hydroxychloroquine. As hot spots shift in the U.S., Washington State shows how one place that is rebounding can help others. The U.S. is undercounting the number of people who have died in the pandemic, experts say. See more updates Updated 1m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\nDr. Megan L. Ranney, an emergency physician at Brown University in Rhode Island, said in an interview on Sunday night that she had never seen an elected official advertise a miracle cure the way Mr. Trump has.\n\n\"There are side effects to hydroxychloroquine,\" Dr. Ranney said. \"It causes psychiatric symptoms, cardiac problems and a host of other bad side effects.\"\n\nDr. Ranney said that the drug could be effective for some patients, but that there was not nearly enough scientific evidence to support Mr. Trump's claims.\n\n\"There may be a role for it for some people,\" she said, \"but to tell Americans 'you don't have anything to lose,' that's not true. People certainly have something to lose by taking it indiscriminately.\"\n\nHydroxychloroquine has not been proved to work against Covid-19 in any significant clinical trials. A small trial by Chinese researchers made public last week found that it helped speed the recovery in moderately ill patients, but the study was not peer-reviewed and had significant limitations. Earlier reports from France and China have drawn criticism because they did not include control groups to compare treated patients with untreated ones, and researchers have called the reports anecdotal. Without controls, they said, it is impossible to determine whether the drugs worked.\n\nBut Mr. Trump on Sunday dismissed the notion that doctors should wait for further study.\n\n\"We don't have time to go and say, 'Gee, let's take a couple of years and test it out,' and let's go out and test with the test tubes and the laboratories,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'd love to do that, but we have people dying today.\"\n\nMr. Trump is typically joined at his briefings by top medical advisers, including Dr. Fauci and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, his coronavirus coordinator. But the president does most of the talking, and has told several advisers that the briefings give him free airtime and good ratings.\n\nA day earlier, Dr. Fauci had privately challenged rising optimism about the drug's efficacy during a meeting of the coronavirus task force in the White House's Situation Room, according to two people familiar with the events who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a conversation in a sensitive setting. The argument was first reported by the website Axios.\n\nThe meeting's agenda included the question of how the administration would discuss chloroquines. Dr. Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, gave an update on chloroquines, and what various tests and anecdotal evidence had shown. Peter Navarro, the president's trade adviser who is overseeing supply chain issues related to the coronavirus, asked to join the meeting, said the people briefed on what took place.\n\nMr. Navarro, who has been pushing to secure chloroquines at the president's request to provide to caregivers, walked in with a sheaf of folders he had placed on a chair next to him, plopped them on the table and said he had seen studies from various countries, as well as information culled from officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showing the \"clear\" efficacy of the drug in treating the coronavirus. Mr. Navarro also argued that the medicine was being used by doctors and nurses on the front lines of the coronavirus fight.\n\nDr. Fauci pushed back, echoing remarks he has made in interviews in the past week that rigorous study is still necessary. Mr. Navarro, an economist by training, shot back that the information he had collected was \"science,\" according to the people familiar with the episode.\n\nVice President Mike Pence tried to tamp down the debate, and as emotions calmed, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, advised Mr. Navarro to \"take yes for an answer.\" The president went to the briefing room lectern a short while later and glowed about chloroquine use, suggesting he might even take it himself despite not having symptoms or evidence of the virus.\n\nKatie Miller, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pence, declined to comment, saying the administration does not discuss events in the Situation Room.\n\nLast month, an Arizona man died and his wife was hospitalized after officials said they treated themselves with a deadly home remedy for the coronavirus -- a popular fish tank additive that has the same active ingredient as an anti-malaria drug.\n\nMedical professionals are also concerned that a run on hydroxychloroquine for potential coronavirus treatment could create shortages for people who need it for its traditional uses.\n\nIn a March 25 joint statement, the American Medical Association and two pharmacists' associations noted that doctors and pharmacists have been prescribing the drug for their families and colleagues and that some pharmacies and hospitals had purchased \"excessive amounts of these medications in anticipation of potentially using them for Covid-19 prevention and treatment.\"\n\n\"The organizations strongly oppose these actions,\" the statement said, citing potential \"grave consequences for patients with conditions such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis if the drugs are not available in the community.\"\n\nSince patients with heart troubles and other underlying conditions are more likely to be severely affected by the coronavirus, they may also be at higher risk of dangerous side effects from hydroxychloroquine, said Dr. Kenneth B. Klein, a consultant who works for drug companies to design and evaluate their clinical trials.\n\n\"What have we got to lose?\" Dr. Klein said, echoing Mr. Trump's remarks. \"We've got patients to lose from dangerous side effects.\"\n\nMr. Trump did mention the potential risks to patients with heart troubles, but Dr. Klein said that even people with normal hearts are at risk for developing a fatal arrhythmia. And he said other medications could interact with hydroxychloroquine and cause serious medical complications.\n\n\"Then the doctor would have to spend time thinking, could this drug be playing a role, either directly or indirectly?\" Dr. Klein said.\n\nOther researchers have noted that while future trials may show a benefit, hydroxychloroquine has disappointed in the past, even though it has been tested as a treatment for other viruses, including influenza.\n\n\"Hydroxychloroquine has been studied as a possible antiviral therapy for many decades,\" said Dr. Luciana Borio, who oversaw public health preparedness for the National Security Council in Mr. Trump's White House and was the acting chief scientist at the F.D.A. under President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Despite showing evidence of activity against several viruses in the laboratory, it never showed success in randomized clinical trials.\"\n\nMichael D.

Outbreak\n\nThe hospitals are eerily quiet, except for Covid-19.\n\nI have heard this sentiment from fellow doctors across the United States and in many other countries. We are all asking: Where are all the patients with heart attacks and stroke? They are missing from our hospitals.\n\nYale New Haven Hospital, where I work, has almost 300 people stricken with Covid-19, and the numbers keep rising -- and yet we are not yet at capacity because of a marked decline in our usual types of patients. In more normal times, we never have so many empty beds.\n\nOur hospital is usually so full that patients wait in gurneys along the walls of the emergency department for a bed to become available on the general wards or even in the intensive care unit. We send people home from the hospital as soon as possible so we can free up beds for those who are waiting. But the pandemic has caused a previously unimaginable shift in the demand for hospital services.\n\nSome of the excess capacity is indeed by design. We canceled elective procedures, though many of those patients never needed hospitalization. We are now providing care at home through telemedicine, but those services are for stable outpatients, not for those who are acutely ill.\n\nWhat is striking is that many of the emergencies have disappeared. Heart attack and stroke teams, always poised to rush in and save lives, are mostly idle. This is not just at my hospital. My fellow cardiologists have shared with me that their cardiology consultations have shrunk, except those related to Covid-19. In an informal Twitter poll by @angioplastyorg, an online community of cardiologists, almost half of the respondents reported that they are seeing a 40 percent to 60 percent reduction in admissions for heart attacks; about 20 percent reported more than a 60 percent reduction.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak New York sees a possible plateau, but warns that it is still in crisis. Wisconsin postpones Tuesday's elections as cases rise. Iran will lift a nationwide shutdown of businesses, saying that economic activity must continue. See more updates Updated 13m ago More live coverage: Markets New York\n\nAnd this is not a phenomenon specific to the United States. Investigators from Spain reported a 40 percent reduction in emergency procedures for heart attacks during the last week of March compared with the period just before the pandemic hit.\n\nAnd it may not just be heart attacks and strokes. Colleagues on Twitter report a decline in many other emergencies, including acute appendicitis and acute gall bladder disease.\n\nThe most concerning possible explanation is that people stay home and suffer rather than risk coming to the hospital and getting infected with coronavirus. This theory suggests that Covid-19 has instilled fear of face-to-face medical care. As a result, many people with urgent health problems may be opting to remain at home rather than call for help. And when they do finally seek medical attention, it is often only after their condition has worsened. Doctors from Hong Kong reported an increase in patients coming to the hospital late in the course of their heart attack, when treatment is less likely to be lifesaving.\n\nThere are other possible explanations for the missing patients. In this time of social distancing, our meals, social interactions and physical activity patterns tend to be very different. Maybe we have removed some of the triggers for heart attacks and strokes, like excessive eating and drinking or abrupt periods of physical exertion. This theory merits research but seems unlikely to explain the dramatic changes we're observing.\n\nWe actually expected to see more heart attacks during this time. Respiratory infections typically increase the risk of heart attacks. Studies suggest that recent respiratory infections can double the risk of a heart attack or stroke. The risk seems to begin soon after the respiratory infection develops, so any rise in heart attacks or strokes should be evident by now. We urge people to get flu vaccines every year, in part, to protect their hearts.\n\nAlso, times of stress increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Depression, anxiety and frustration, feelings that the pandemic might exacerbate, are all associated with a doubling or more of heart attack risks. Work and life stress, which also may be higher with the acute disruptions we've all been going through, can markedly increase the risk of a heart attack. Moreover, events like earthquakes or terrorist attacks or war, in which an entire society is exposed to a stressor, are risk factors for heart attacks. Finally, Covid-19 can actually affect the heart, which should be increasing the number of patients with heart problems.\n\nExperts are bringing together data to confirm these patterns. We hope to gain a greater understanding of their causes and consequences.\n\nMeanwhile, the immediate message to patients is clear: Don't delay needed treatment. If fear of the pandemic leads people to delay or avoid care, then the death rate will extend far beyond those directly infected by the virus. Time to treatment dictates the outcomes for people with heart attacks and strokes. These deaths may not be labeled Covid-19 deaths, but surely, they are collateral damage.\n\nThe public needs to know that hospitals are equipped not only to care for people with Covid-19 but also those who have other life-threatening health problems. Yes, we in health care are working to keep people out of the hospital if we can, but we can safely provide care for those people who are not sick from Covid-19. Masks and protective gear for health care workers and patients go a long way to ensure a safe environment. Also, people with chronic conditions need to know that avoidance of needed care could ultimately be as big a threat as the virus itself.\n\nAs we fight coronavirus, we need to combat perceptions that everyone else must stay away from the hospital.

Funding", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak Here's what you need to know:New York region suffers record deaths, and small businesses struggle to secure loans.Trump sidelines federal watchdog and lashes out at the W.H.O.Doctors and others on the coronavirus front lines are being taken to court over child custody issues.John Prine, folk singer and songwriter, dies of complications of Covid-19.Air pollution has been linked to a higher coronavirus death rate.Time is of the essence for disinfecting your home and hands.New York region suffers record deaths, and small businesses struggle to secure loans.\n\nWhile New York area officials are seeing hopeful signs in a slowing rate of new coronavirus infections, mortality figures -- a lagging indicator -- have continued to rise.\n\nNew York State, with a population of nearly 20 million, now has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than Italy, a nation of 60 million that was the first in Europe to be ravaged by the disease. And in New York City, where the total number of recorded fatalities surged to 4,009, the virus has claimed more lives than the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nNew York, New Jersey and Connecticut all announced their highest daily death tolls this week, accounting for 1,034 of the 1,800 nationwide deaths.\n\nThe rising toll reflects the often considerable lag between the time people are infected and the day they die, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said. He also warned that the gains could quickly be undone if people stopped following social distancing protocols.\n\nLike Italy within Europe, New York has had the misfortune of being the first place in the United States where the virus deeply seeded itself in the population. But a New York Times investigation also found that early missteps, including delays in closing schools and failing to break the chain of transmission within households, have proved costly.\n\nThe virus has since spread rapidly around the country, and even President Trump, otherwise eager to put a positive spin on his much maligned response to the pandemic, has said that Americans faced a week of death and sorrow. And it surely will not be the last, as many states have still not felt the pathogen's full wrath.\n\nNor will that be the end of the hardship, as economists warn of a long healing period for the economy after the health crisis.\n\nSmall businesses, which are unlikely to have cash buffers to survive the economic shutdown, have been especially hard hit. Yet the federal agency responsible for disbursing $349 billion in emergency relief has not been able to cope with the explosive demand for funds.\n\nEven as Congress discussed injecting billions more into the economy, Mr. Trump sidelined the top watchdog in charge of monitoring how the administration spends the $2 trillion in virus relief that Congress has approved. Democrats criticized the move as \"corrupt,\" saying the president wanted a less independent voice.\n\nMr. Trump also accused the World Health Organization of not being aggressive enough in confronting the dangers from the virus -- the very criticism that has been leveled at his administration.\n\nHe threatened to cut off funding for the organization even as the virus continues to haunt the world. With the health care systems of wealthy nations stretched to the breaking point when confronted by an outbreak, there is growing concern about the damage the virus could inflict on poorer countries.\n\nThose same strains have become painfully evident across America, where entrenched inequalities in income and access to health care have been evident in the disproportionately high rates of infection and death among black people.\n\nCoronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count\n\nA detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county.\n\nTrump sidelines federal watchdog and lashes out at the W.H.O.\n\nPresident Trump on Tuesday sidelined the top watchdog in charge of monitoring how the administration spends $2 trillion in virus relief, replacing him with a different federal official in a move that Democrats labeled \"corrupt.\"\n\nThe official, Glenn A. Fine, has been the acting inspector general for the Defense Department since before Mr. Trump took office and was set to become the chairman of a new Pandemic Response Accountability Committee to monitor how the government carries out the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. But Mr. Trump replaced Mr. Fine in his Pentagon job, disqualifying him from serving on the new oversight panel.\n\nCritics said the move sent a message to government watchdogs to tread softly. \"I cannot see how any inspector general will feel in any way safe to do a good job,\" said Danielle Brian, the executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group. \"They are all at the mercy at what the president feels.\"\n\nMr. Trump also threatened to cut funding from the World Health Organization, accusing it of not being aggressive enough in confronting the dangers from the virus.\n\n\"We're going to put a hold on money spent to the W.H.O.,\" Mr. Trump said during the daily coronavirus briefing at the White House. \"We're going to put a very powerful hold on it and we're going to see.\"\n\nIn effect, Mr. Trump sought to denounce the W.H.O. for the very criticisms that have been leveled at him and his administration. Public health experts have said that the president's public denials of the virus's dangers slowed the American response, which included delayed testing and a failure to stockpile protective gear.\n\nIn fact, the W.H.O. sounded the alarm in the earliest days of the crisis, declaring a \"public health emergency of international concern\" a day before the United States secretary of health and human services announced the country's own public health emergency and weeks before Mr. Trump declared a national emergency.\n\nAfter saying that the United States would \"put a hold\" on the organization's money, the president later denied having made those remarks and appeared to back down.\n\n\"I'm not saying that I'm going to do it, but we're going to look at it,\" he said.\n\nDoctors and others on the coronavirus front lines are being taken to court over child custody issues.\n\nLast month, Dr. Bertha Mayorquin, a New Jersey physician, told her soon-to-be ex-husband that there was a change in plans. After two weeks of providing treatment by video as a precaution against the coronavirus, she would resume seeing patients in person.\n\nBut when she left work on a Friday to pick up her two daughters for the weekend, her husband presented her with a court order granting him sole temporary custody of the girls. His lawyer had convinced a judge that Dr. Mayorquin could expose the children, 11 and 8, to Covid-19.\n\nThe doctor, an internist, had intended to spend the weekend celebrating her younger daughter's birthday. Instead, she spent it assembling 50 pages of paperwork to try to reverse the order.\n\n\"Many people working in the hospitals -- doctors, nurses, so many of us -- are parents,\" said Dr. Mayorquin, whose hospital had asked her to starting treat non-coronavirus patients at an urgent care center to ease the burden of the pandemic. \"Are our children going to be taken away from us because we are on the front lines helping people?\"\n\nThat question is arising across the United States as a growing number of parents have begun withholding access to their children from former spouses or partners over fears of infection, according to families, lawyers and judges.\n\nFor health care and other essential workers, some say they shouldn't be punished for doing crucial services. Their counterparts say that the jobs pose too great a risk to other family members.\n\nJohn Prine, folk singer and songwriter, dies of complications of Covid-19.\n\nJohn Prine, the raspy-voiced country-folk singer whose ingenious lyrics to songs by turns poignant, angry and comic made him a favorite of Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson and others, died on Tuesday in Nashville, Tenn. He was 73.\n\nThe cause was complications from Covid-19, his family said.\n\nMr. Prine was a relative unknown in 1970 when Mr. Kristofferson heard him play one night at a small Chicago club called the Fifth Peg, dragged there by the singer-songwriter Steve Goodman. Mr. Kristofferson was performing in Chicago at the time at the Quiet Knight.\n\nAt the Fifth Peg, Mr. Prine treated him to a brief after-hours performance of material that, Mr. Kristofferson later wrote, \"was unlike anything I'd heard before.\"\n\nHis debut album, called simply \"John Prine\" and released in 1971, included songs that became his signatures. Some gained wider fame after being recorded by other artists.\n\nMr. Dylan, listing his favorite songwriters for The Huffington Post in 2009, put Mr. Prine front and center. \"Prine's stuff is pure Proustian existentialism,\" he said. \"Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs.\"\n\nRead the full obituary here.\n\nAir pollution has been linked to a higher coronavirus death rate.\n\nCoronavirus patients in areas that had high levels of air pollution before the pandemic are more likely to die from the infection than patients in cleaner parts of the United States, according to a new nationwide study that offers the first clear link between long-term exposure to pollution and Covid-19 death rates.\n\nIn an analysis of 3,080 counties in the United States, researchers at the Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that higher levels of the tiny, dangerous particles in air known as PM 2.5 were associated with higher death rates from the disease.\n\nFor weeks, public health officials have surmised a link between dirty air and death or serious illness from Covid-19, which is caused by the coronavirus. The Harvard analysis points to a \"large overlap\" between Covid-19 deaths and other diseases associated with long-term exposure to fine particulate matter.\n\nThe paper found that if Manhattan had lowered its average particulate matter level by just a single unit, or one microgram per cubic meter, over the past 20 years, the borough would probably have seen 248 fewer Covid-19 deaths by this point in the outbreak.\n\nOver all, the research could have significant implications for how public health officials allocate resources like ventilators and respirators as the coronavirus spreads. The paper has been submitted for peer review and publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIt found that just a slight increase in long-term pollution exposure could have serious coronavirus-related consequences, even accounting for other factors like smoking rates and population density.\n\nTime is of the essence for disinfecting your home and hands.\n\nYou've been cleaning your home and washing your hands all these years, and probably never stopped to consider whether you were doing it effectively. But time matters when it comes to fully disinfecting your household surfaces and your skin.\n\nIn the case of some disinfectants, it can take up to 10 minutes for them to fully work. As for your hands? Scrubbing for a full 20 seconds is the way to go.\n\nReporting was contributed by Megan Twohey, Marc Santora, Charlie Savage, Peter Baker, William Grimes, Lisa Friedman, Julia Echikson and Patricia Mazzei.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Prine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_A._Fine", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glenn A.

Bookbinder is the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nWhen President Trump announced late Friday that he would fire the government watchdog who told Congress about the Ukraine whistle-blower complaint, which ultimately led to his impeachment, it touched off one of the most acute threats yet to our democracy. But it didn't even make the front page of most papers.\n\nThat's understandable. Thousands of Americans are dying every day from the terrifying coronavirus pandemic. People are worried about their own safety and that of their families, as well as about their jobs and livelihood. Questions abound about how the crisis got to this point, whether the Trump administration took appropriate steps to address it, and what steps are needed to minimize the devastation going forward; there is little bandwidth for anything else.\n\nBut we can't afford to ignore the anti-democratic steps the president is taking while the American people are appropriately preoccupied with this outbreak. If we don't respond to these outrageous abuses now, the damage may be done by the time anyone is the wiser.\n\nThe worst of the president's latest round of steps to undermine checks and balances came not just in this time of crisis, but on a Friday night, the classic black hole for sweeping problematic actions in Washington under the rug.\n\nFirst, the president announced that he would be firing Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community. Mr. Trump said in a required letter to Congress that he no longer had \"the fullest confidence\" in Atkinson; there was not even an effort to disguise the fact that what caused the president to lose that confidence was Atkinson following the law and allowing the truth to come out about Mr. Trump's lawless attempt to pressure a foreign power to announce politically helpful investigations. Mr. Atkinson will be fired 30 days after the letter went to Congress, the soonest he can be under law, but the president undercut even that law by putting Mr. Atkinson on immediate administrative leave.\n\nMichael Horowitz, the respected inspector general of the Department of Justice and chairman of a council that coordinates inspectors general, went out on a limb to vouch for Mr. Atkinson, praising his integrity and his handling of the Ukraine whistle-blower complaint. Mr. Horowitz is right, and his affirmation that the inspector general community \"will continue to conduct aggressive, independent oversight\" is heartening.\n\nBut President Trump's further action makes that claim questionable at best. The president compounded the Atkinson announcement on Friday night with his intention to nominate White House lawyer Brian Miller to be special inspector general for pandemic recovery, a key position for oversight of the just-passed $2 trillion coronavirus relief package, which is ripe for fraud and corruption without aggressive review. The position demands ironclad independence, particularly with the risk that the president's company, relatives, customers and donors could seek to benefit from the stimulus package. Mr. Miller, who served for nearly 10 years as inspector general at the General Services Administration, but more recently played a role in the White House's response to the impeachment inquiry, is precisely the wrong person to ensure independence. A former senior Senate staff member praised Miller's \"loyalty to the administration\" in explaining why he'll make a good choice, even though loyalty is the exact opposite of what is needed.\n\nThe one-two punch of Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Miller is, unfortunately, just the tip of the iceberg of the president's dangerous attacks on the independence of inspectors general. Mr. Trump will likely fire additional inspectors general because he and his allies view them as \"deep state\" operatives who undermine him. Indeed, the president seems to view any independence within the government and certainly any checks on him as intolerable disloyalty; that notion, of course, runs counter to our entire system of checks and balances.\n\nFriday night's actions came at the end of a week of scary departures from democratic practices. Reporting indicates that more and more power has gone to the president's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, whose coronavirus \"shadow task force\" of government allies and private sector connections may run afoul of federal law. Mr. Kushner is meanwhile also reportedly playing a significant role in the Trump re-election campaign from the White House, which may also violate federal law. Nepotism and disregard for the law have characterized this administration from day one, but the volume and brazenness of these anti-democratic tendencies is increasing.\n\nIndeed, earlier Friday, the government changed its description on a federal website of the strategic national stockpile to correspond to Mr. Kushner's description of it as being for the benefit of the federal government, not the states. Also last week, the Navy fired a captain who blew the whistle on the scope of a Covid-19 outbreak on his ship, another example of apparent payback for truthtelling, and the president reportedly wants to have his own signature on stimulus checks to Americans, which may also run afoul of law. All of these autocratic steps come on top of the president's February purges of officials who testified in the impeachment trial and attempts to meddle in the sentencing of friends and allies convicted of crimes.\n\nHere's why this matters: times of crisis are when democracies are in the gravest danger of crumbling. We are seeing that play out in the world right now. Hungary, which has watched its hard won post-Cold War democratic reforms slipping away for some time, this week saw its Parliament give Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whom Mr. Trump has praised, unlimited authority, effectively turning the country into a dictatorship. Dictators around the world are using the pandemic to tighten their control.\n\nWe're not there yet. But the president's attempts to rid the government of those who would provide appropriate oversight and accountability for abuses and speak truth to power, to put in place loyalists who will look out for him rather than providing independent checks, and to empower relatives and disregard laws sets us on a dangerous trajectory. Firing inspectors general and replacing them with loyalists is a serious threat to our democracy. The American people must register our outrage; Congress must investigate the firings aggressively and rigorously vet nominees. If we ignore the erosion of checks and balances because we are preoccupied with more immediate concerns, we may find that our democracy -- when we need the institutions of this country the most -- is disappearing. Just ask Hungary.\n\nNoah Bookbinder is the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The coronavirus pandemic\n\nmay have reminded Americans that they're all in it together.\n\nBut it has also shown them how dangerously far they are apart. It may not feel like it now, but out of this crisis there's a chance to build a better America.\n\nSupported by\n\nContinue reading the main storyThe America We Need\n\nHow to make the nation more just, less fragile -- and more free.\n\nBy The Editorial Board\n\nApril 9, 2020, 5:00 a.m. ET\n\nFrom some of its darkest hours, the United States has emerged stronger and more resilient.\n\nBetween May and July 1862, even as Confederate victories in Virginia raised doubts about the future of the Union, Congress and President Abraham Lincoln kept their eyes on the horizon, enacting three landmark laws that shaped the nation's next chapter: The Homestead Act allowed western settlers to claim 160 acres of public land apiece; the Morrill Act provided land grants for states to fund universities; and the Pacific Railway Act underwrote the transcontinental railroad.\n\nNearly 75 years later, in the depths of the Great Depression, with jobs in short supply and many Americans reduced to waiting in bread lines, President Franklin Roosevelt proved similarly farsighted. He concluded the best way to revive and sustain prosperity was not merely to pump money into the economy but to rewrite the rules of the marketplace. \"Liberty,\" Roosevelt said at the Democratic Party's convention in 1936, \"requires opportunity to make a living -- a living decent according to the standard of the time, a living which gives man not only enough to live by, but something to live for.\" His administration, working with Congress, enshrined the right of workers to bargain collectively, imposed strict rules and regulators on the financial industry, and created Social Security to provide pensions for the elderly and disabled.\n\nThis article is part of a Times Opinion series exploring how the nation can emerge from this crisis stronger, fairer and more free. Read the editor's introductory letter.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has laid bare once again the incomplete nature of the American project -- the great distance between the realities of life and death in the United States and the values enunciated in its founding documents.\n\nOver the past half century, the fabric of American democracy has been stretched thin. The nation has countenanced debilitating decay in its public institutions and a concentration of economic power not seen since the 1920s. While many Americans live without financial security or opportunity, a relative handful of families holds much of the nation's wealth. Over the past decade, the wealth of the top 1 percent of households has surpassed the combined wealth of the bottom 80 percent.\n\nThe present crisis has revealed the United States as a nation in which professional basketball players could be rapidly tested for the coronavirus but health care workers were turned away; in which the affluent could retreat to the safety of second homes, relying on workers who can't take paid sick leave to deliver food; in which children in lower-income households struggle to connect to the digital classrooms where their school lessons are now supposed to be delivered.\n\nMike Blake/Reuters Luke Sharrett for The New York Times\n\nIt is a nation in which local officials issuing stay-at-home orders must reckon with the cruel irony that hundreds of thousands of Americans do not have homes. Lacking private places, they must sleep in public spaces. Las Vegas painted rectangles on an asphalt parking lot to remind homeless residents to sleep six feet apart -- an act that might as well have been a grim piece of performance art titled \"The Least We Can Do.\"\n\nIt is a nation in which enduring racial inequalities, in wealth and in health, are reflected in the pandemic's death toll. In Michigan, where the coronavirus hit early and hard, African-Americans make up just 14 percent of the state's population but 40 percent of the dead. Jason Hargrove, who kept driving a Detroit city bus as the virus spread, posted a Facebook video on March 21 complaining about a female passenger who coughed without covering her mouth. He said he had to keep working, to care for his family. In the video, he told his wife he'd take off his clothes in the front hall when he got home and get right in the shower, so that she stayed safe. Less than two weeks later, he was dead.\n\n[To hear more audio stories from publishers, like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.]\n\nThe federal government is providing temporary aid to less fortunate Americans, and few have objected to those emergency measures. But already some politicians are asserting that the extraordinary nature of the crisis does not warrant permanent changes in the social contract.\n\nThis misapprehends both the nature of crises in general and the particulars of the present emergency. The magnitude of a crisis is determined not just by the impact of the precipitating events but also by the fragility of the system it attacks. Our society was especially vulnerable to this pandemic because so many Americans lack the essential liberty to protect their own lives and the lives of their families.\n\nThis nation was ailing long before the coronavirus reached its shores.\n\nA great divide separates affluent Americans, who fully enjoy the benefits of life in the wealthiest nation on earth, from the growing portion of the population whose lives lack stability or any real prospect of betterment.\n\nThe hedge-fund billionaire Kenneth Griffin paid $238 million last year for a New York apartment overlooking Central Park. He plans to stay there when he happens to be in town. Meanwhile, 10.9 million American families barely can afford an apartment. They spend more than half of their incomes on rent, and so they scrimp on food and health care. And on any given night, half a million Americans are homeless.\n\nFor those at the bottom, moreover, the chances of rising are in decline. By the time they reached 30, more than 90 percent of Americans born in 1940 were earning more than their parents had earned at the same age. But among those born in 1980, only half were earning more than their parents by the age of 30.\n\nThe erosion of the American dream is not a result of laziness or a talent drought. Rather, opportunity has slipped away. The economic ladder is harder to climb; real incomes have stagnated for decades even as the costs of housing, education and health care have increased. Many lower-income Americans are born into polluted, impoverished neighborhoods, with no decent jobs to be found.\n\n\"By 40, my parents owned a house, had a kid -- me -- and were both doing well in their careers,\" said Melanie Martin-Leff, who works in marketing in Philadelphia. \"I'm freelancing, renting, partnerless and childless.\"\n\nThe inequalities of wealth have become inequalities of health. A middle-aged American in the top fifth of the income distribution can expect to live about 13 years longer than a person of the same age in the bottom fifth -- an advantage that has more than doubled since 1980.\n\nThese changes have become harder to reverse because the distribution of political power also is increasingly unequal. Our system of democracy is under strain as those with wealth increasingly shape the course of policymaking, acting from self-interest and perhaps also because it has become harder to imagine life on the other side of the divide or to design policy in the common interest.\n\nThe wealthy are particularly successful in blocking changes they don't like. The political scientists Martin Gilens of Princeton and Benjamin Page of Northwestern have calculated that between 1981 and 2002, policies supported by at least 80 percent of affluent voters passed into law about 45 percent of the time, while policies opposed by at least 80 percent of those voters passed into law just 18 percent of the time. Importantly, the views of poor and middle-class voters had little influence.\n\nThe fragility of our society and government is the product of deliberate decisions. The modern welfare state was constructed in three great waves:\n\nInterior view of a production line showing workers filling cans with olives in a factory in California, USA, circa 1900.

Photo by Thomas D Mcavoy/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images\n\nIn the Progressive legislation of the early 20th century...\n\n...in Roosevelt's New Deal...\n\n... and in President Johnson's Great Society, which created programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Head Start.\n\nThese policies embodied a broad and muscular conception of liberty: that government should provide all Americans with the freedom that comes from a stable and prosperous life.\n\n\"We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence,\" Roosevelt told the nation in 1944.\n\nThe goal, of course, was never realized in full, but since the late 1960s, the federal government has largely abandoned the attempt. The defining trend in American public policy has been to diminish government's role as a guarantor of personal liberty.\n\nAdvocates of a minimalist conception of government claim they too are defenders of liberty. But theirs is a narrow and negative definition of freedom: the freedom from civic duty, from mutual obligation, from taxation. This impoverished view of freedom has in practice protected wealth and privilege. It has perpetuated the nation's defining racial inequalities and kept the poor trapped in poverty, and their children, and their children's children.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of this retreat was the government's role in constructing a new residential landscape of economically and racially segregated communities. The government built highways that carried white families to new suburban neighborhoods where minorities often were not allowed to live; it provided mortgage loans that minorities were not allowed to obtain; and even after explicit discrimination was declared illegal, single-family zoning laws continued to exclude low-income families, particularly minorities.\n\nPolicymakers tied funding for public services to the prosperity of the new communities, and the Supreme Court blessed the practice in a 1973 ruling, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, that allowed differences in school funding based on differences in local property values. The effect was to substitute economic segregation for explicitly racial segregation.\n\nThe government similarly enabled growing divisions in the workplace. As the economy shifted from manufacturing to services, corporations -- with the help of Congress and local lawmakers -- successfully resisted the unionization of new jobs. And the government declined to replace organized labor as the protector of workers in burgeoning sectors like retail and health care.\n\nCompanies were not required to provide employees with basic benefits like paid leave, and they were given free rein to claim that many of their full-time workers were actually contractors. The purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has been falling since 1968.\n\nA shift in corporate behavior also harmed workers. Many business leaders rallied around a narrow conception of corporate responsibility, arguing the sole obligation of a corporation was to maximize shareholder returns. Policymakers backed the shift, notably by writing that narrow definition into the laws of Delaware, where many large companies maintain official homes.\n\nThe results are clear enough: Executive pay has skyrocketed, and shareholders have enjoyed rising stock prices, at least until recently, while most workers are falling behind. If individual income had kept pace with overall economic growth since 1970, Americans in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution would be making an extra $12,000 per year, on average. In effect, the extreme increase in inequality means every worker in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution is sending an annual check for $12,000 to a worker in the top 10 percent.\n\nThe idealization of individual action in an open marketplace has had its mirror image in the denigration of collective action through government.\n\nThe United States does not guarantee the availability of affordable housing to its citizens, as do most developed nations. It does not guarantee reliable access to health care, as does virtually every other developed nation. The cost of a college education in the United States is among the highest in the developed world. And beyond the threadbare nature of the American safety net, the government has pulled back from investment in infrastructure, education and basic scientific research, the building blocks of future prosperity. It is not surprising many Americans have lost confidence in the government as a vehicle for achieving the things that we cannot achieve alone.\n\nAndrew Spear for The New York Times Todd Heisler/The New York Times\n\nThe nation's hierarchies are starkly visible during periods of crisis. The coronavirus pandemic has necessitated extraordinary sacrifices, but the distribution is profoundly unequal.\n\nThe wealthy and famous and politically powerful have laid first claim to the available lifeboats: Senators Richard Burr of North Carolina and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia secured their own fortunes by selling off stock holdings as the virus spread in January and February, even as they reassured the nation that everything was going to be OK; the billionaire David Geffen posted on Instagram that he planned to ride out the crisis on his 454-foot yacht, Rising Sun, adding, \"I'm hoping everybody is staying safe\"; large corporations lobbied successfully against a proposal to provide paid sick leave to every American worker, pleading they couldn't afford the cost.\n\nLess affluent Americans will bear the brunt in health and wealth. Already they suffer disproportionately from the diseases of labor like black lung and mesothelioma; the diseases of poverty like obesity and diabetes; and the opioid epidemic that has raged in the communities where opportunity is in short supply. By one estimate, these patterns of poor health mean those at the bottom of the income spectrum are twice as likely to die from Covid-19. Many are losing their jobs; those still working generally cannot do so from the safety of the living room couch. They risk death to obtain the necessities of life.\n\nChildren, relatively safe from the coronavirus itself, are in particular danger from the economic fallout. Public schools are one of the great equalizing forces in American life; the shift to online learning means existing inequalities matter more. Millions of children lack reliable internet access. The principal of a high school in Phoenix found three students huddled under a blanket outside the building on a rainy day, using the school's wireless network to complete their required schoolwork because they could not log in from their homes.\n\nAnd research shows the impact of economic traumas in childhood are long-lasting. The children of parents who lose work, for example, end up earning less over their own lifetimes.\n\nThe crisis has also exposed the federal government's lack of resources, competence and ambition. The government failed to contain the virus through a program of testing and targeted quarantines; it is struggling to provide states with the medical equipment necessary to help those who fall ill; and instead of moving more aggressively to contain the economic damage, the federal government has allowed companies to lay off millions of workers. The unemployment rate in the United States has most likely already reached the highest level since the Great Depression.\n\nA major reason for the faltering response is a chimerical expectation that markets will perform the work of government. The White House has for the most part refused to mandate or coordinate production of critical medical supplies. Indeed, the federal government has bid against states for available supplies and encouraged states to bid against one another. It is an embrace of markets so extreme it might seem farcical if it wasn't resulting in unnecessary deaths.\n\nCorporate action and philanthropy certainly have their places, particularly in the short term, given President Trump's feckless leadership and the tattered condition of the government he heads. But they are poor substitutes for effective stewardship by public institutions. What America needs is a just and activist government. The nature of democracy is that we are together responsible for saving ourselves.\n\nAmericans need to recover the optimism that has so often lighted the path forward.\n\nThe crucible of a crisis provides the opportunity to forge a better society, but the crisis itself does not do the work. Crises expose problems, but they do not supply alternatives, let alone political will. Change requires ideas and leadership. Nations often pass through the same kinds of crises repeatedly, either unable to imagine a different path or unwilling to walk it.\n\nThe worst crises often occur under weak leadership; that is a big part of how an initial problem spirals out of control. Americans had every reason to despair of President James Buchanan's ability to lead the nation through a civil war, or of President Herbert Hoover's ability to lead the nation out of the Great Depression. Now, as then, the country is burdened with weak leadership -- and it has a chance to replace that leadership, as it did in 1860 and 1932.\n\nThere is also a need for new ideas, and the revival of older ideas, about what the government owes the nation's citizens, what corporations owe employees and what we owe one another.\n\nThe multi-trillion-dollar scale of the government's response to the crisis, for all its flaws and inadequacies, offers a powerful reminder that there is no replacement for an activist state. The political scientist Francis Fukuyama has observed that the nations best weathering the coronavirus pandemic are those like Singapore and Germany, where there is broad trust in government -- and where the state merits that confidence. A critical part of America's post-crisis rebuilding project is to restore the effectiveness of the government and to rebuild public confidence in it.\n\nA major investment in public health would be a fitting place to start.\n\nThe larger project, however, is to increase the resilience of American society. Generations of federal policymakers have prioritized the pursuit of economic growth with scant regard for stability or distribution. This moment demands a restoration of the national commitment to a richer conception of freedom: economic security and equality of opportunity. That's why Times Opinion is publishing this project across the next two months, to envision how to turn the America we have into the America we need.\n\nThe purpose of the federal government, Lincoln wrote to Congress on July 4, 1861, was \"to elevate the condition of men, to lift artificial burdens from all shoulders, and to give everyone an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life.\" The Homestead Act in particular was a concrete step in that direction: 10 percent of all the land in the United States was ultimately distributed in 160-acre chunks. But Lincoln's conception of \"everyone\" did not include everyone: The Homestead Act rested on the expropriation of Native American lands.\n\nRoosevelt shared Lincoln's vision of government, but industry had replaced agriculture as the wellspring of prosperity, so he focused on ensuring a more equitable distribution of the nation's manufacturing output -- although African-Americans were treated as second-class citizens in many New Deal programs.\n\nThe United States today is in need of new measures to stake all Americans in the modern economy.\n\nTo give Americans a fair chance in the race of life, the government must begin from birth. The United States must reclaim the core truth of the Supreme Court's seminal decision in Brown v. Board of Education: So long as Americans are segregated, their opportunities can never be equal. One of the most important steps the United States can take to ensure all children have the opportunity to thrive is to bulldoze enduring patterns of racial and economic segregation. Zoning laws that limit residential development in the very areas where good jobs are most abundant are one of the most important structural obstacles to a more integrated nation.\n\nOver the course of this project, we will examine other ways to equalize opportunity early in life, and also to restore a healthier balance of power between employers and workers.\n\nOne of the clearest lessons of the pandemic is that many employers feel shockingly little obligation to protect the health and welfare of their workers, and workers have been left with little means to organize or resist. Amazon, one of the nation's largest employers, fired a worker protesting safety conditions at the company's warehouses on the Orwellian grounds that his protest was itself a safety hazard. A manager at a Uline call center instructed employees not to tell colleagues if they weren't feeling well because it might cause \"unnecessary panic.\"\n\nAnd the nation's tattered social safety net is in desperate need of reinforcement. Americans need reliable access to health care. Americans need affordable options for child care and for the care of older members of their families, a growing crisis in an aging nation. No one, and especially not children, should ever go hungry. Everyone deserves a place to call home.\n\nJust a little more than a decade ago, Americans lived through a very different kind of crisis -- a financial collapse -- that exposed similar fragilities in American society. The government's response was inadequate. The recovery was still underway when the coronavirus arrived, and partly because recovery had come so slowly, America's political leaders had failed to take advantage of the intervening years to prepare for the inevitability of fresh tests.\n\nThe nation cannot afford a repeat performance, particularly as other challenges to our society already loom, most of all the imperative to slow global warming.\n\nThe United States has a chance to emerge from this latest crisis as a stronger nation, more just, more free and more resilient.

"Eight U.K. Doctors Died From Coronavirus. All Were Immigrants.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nLONDON -- The eight men moved to Britain from different corners of its former empire, all of them doctors or doctors-to-be, becoming foot soldiers in the effort to build a free universal health service after World War II.\n\nNow their names have become stacked atop a grim list: the first, and so far only, doctors publicly reported to have died after catching the coronavirus in Britain's aching National Health Service.\n\nFor a country ripped apart in recent years by Brexit and the anti-immigrant movement that birthed it, the deaths of the eight doctors -- from Egypt, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Sudan -- attest to the extraordinary dependence of Britain's treasured health service on workers from abroad.\n\nIt is a story tinged with racism, as white, British doctors have largely dominated the prestigious disciplines while foreign doctors have typically found work in places and practices that are apparently putting them on the dangerous front lines of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"When people were standing on the street clapping for N.H.S. workers, I thought, 'A year and a half ago, they were talking about Brexit and how these immigrants have come into our country and want to take our jobs,'\" said Dr. Hisham el-Khidir, whose cousin Dr. Adil el-Tayar, a transplant surgeon, died on March 25 from the coronavirus in western London.\n\n\"Now today, it's the same immigrants that are trying to work with the locals,\" said Dr. el-Khidir, a surgeon in Norwich, \"and they are dying on the front lines.\"\n\nMore than 6,100 people in Britain have died from the coronavirus, among them not just the eight doctors but a number of nurses who worked alongside them, at least one from overseas.\n\nBritain is not the only country reckoning with its debt to foreign doctors amid the terror and chaos of the pandemic. In the United States, where immigrants make up more than a quarter of all doctors but often face long waits for green cards, New York and New Jersey have already cleared the way for graduates of overseas medical schools to suit up in the coronavirus response.\n\nBut Britain, where nearly a third of doctors in National Health Service hospitals are immigrants, has especially strong links to the medical school systems of its former colonies, making it a natural landing place.\n\nThat was true for Dr. el-Tayar, 64, the oldest son of a government clerk and a housewife from Atbara, Sudan, a railway city on the Nile.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Nations tiptoe toward easing lockdowns, keeping an eye on China. E.U.'s top scientist resigns, and finance ministers split on 'coronabonds.' Wuhan ends its lockdown, but hints of worry shadow the recovery. See more updates Updated 9m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nHe had 11 siblings, and one left a special impression: Osman, a brother, who became ill as a child and died without suitable medical treatment. Though Dr. el-Tayar rarely spoke of his brother's death, he gave the same name to his oldest son.\n\n\"In my mind, I think that's what led him to medicine,\" Dr. el-Khidir said. \"He didn't want anyone else in his family to feel that.\"\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Khartoum, Dr. el-Tayar decided to help address a tide of kidney disease sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa. So he moved to Britain in the early 1990s to train as a specialist transplant surgeon. He returned to Sudan around 2010 and helped set up a transplant program there.\n\nBut the deteriorating political situation in Sudan and the recent birth of a son persuaded Dr. el-Tayar to settle back in Britain, where he went to work once again for the health service. Having lost his status as a senior doctor when he left for Sudan, he had taken up work filling in at a surgical assessment unit in Herefordshire, northwest of London, examining patients coming through the emergency room.\n\nIt was there that his family believes Dr. el-Tayar, working with only rudimentary protective gear, contracted the virus. Sequestered in the western London home where he loved sitting next to his 12-year-old son, he became so short of breath recently that he could not string together a sentence. While on a ventilator, his heart failed him.\n\nHad the health service started screening hospital patients for the virus sooner or supplied doctors with better protective gear, Dr. el-Tayar might have lived, said his cousin, Dr. el-Khidir.\n\n\"In our morbidity analyses, we go through each and every case and ask, 'Was it preventable? Was it avoidable?'\" he said. \"I'm trying to answer this question with my cousin now. Even with all the difficulties, I've got to say the answer has to be yes.\"\n\nAnalysts warn that doctor shortages across countries ravaged by the coronavirus will worsen as the virus spreads. While ventilators may be the scarcest resource for now, a shortage of doctors and nurses trained to operate them could leave hospitals struggling to make use even of what they have.\n\nBy recruiting foreign doctors, Britain saves the roughly $270,000 in taxpayer money that it costs to train doctors locally, a boon to a system that does not spend enough on medical education to staff its own hospitals. That effectively leaves Britain depending on the largess of countries with weaker health care systems to train its own work force.\n\nEven so, the doctors are hampered by thousands of dollars in annual visa fees and, on top of that, a $500 surcharge for using the very health service they work for.\n\nExcluded from the most prestigious disciplines, immigrant doctors have come to dominate so-called Cinderella specialties, like family and elderly medicine, turning them into pillars of Britain's health system. And unlike choosier Britain-born doctors, they have historically gone to work in what one lawmaker in 1961 called \"the rottenest, worst hospitals in the country,\" the very ones that most needed a doctor.\n\nThose same places are now squarely in the path of the virus.\n\n\"Migrant doctors are architects of the N.H.S. -- they're what built it and held it together and worked in the most unpopular, most difficult areas, where white British doctors don't want to go and work,\" said Dr. Aneez Esmail, a professor of general practice at the University of Manchester. \"It's a hidden story.\"\n\nWhen Dr. el-Tayar moved to Britain in the 1990s, he was following a pipeline laid by the family of another doctor who has now died after contracting the coronavirus: Dr. Amged el-Hawrani, 55.\n\nAn ear, nose and throat specialist, Dr. el-Hawrani was about 11 when his father, a radiologist, brought the family in 1975 from Khartoum to Taunton, a town in southwestern England, and then Bristol, a bigger city nearby.\n\nMany Sudanese doctors at the time were burnishing their skills in Britain before returning home or moving to Persian Gulf countries for higher wages. But Dr. el-Hawrani's family turned their home into a staging post for Sudanese doctors interested in longer-term stays, hosting their families during exams or house hunts.\n\n\"The more the merrier,\" said Amal el-Hawrani, a younger brother of Dr. el-Hawrani. \"My mum always liked that.\"\n\nBeing British-Sudanese in the 1980s was not easy. Race riots flared in cities across the country. Mosques were scarce. Dr. el-Hawrani went to school almost exclusively with white British classmates.\n\nThe young doctor quietly stood up for his family: When someone once tried to kill a 100-year-old fern in their garden by cutting out a ring of bark, Dr. el-Hawrani snapped off branches and nailed them across the gap so that nutrients could get across.\n\nStill, discrimination bothered him. When it came time to follow his father into medicine, Dr. el-Hawrani told his brother that he \"wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon but felt that maybe because of certain prejudices he didn't get it.\"\n\nHis resolve only grew stronger after an older brother, Ashraf, a fellow doctor, died at 29 of causes related to asthma. Dr. el-Hawrani discovered his brother's body.\n\nBefore Dr. el-Hawrani's death, on March 28, he had finally come around to the idea that his only son, Ashraf, named in his brother's memory, would study English instead of the family trade. Ashraf said in a statement that his father \"was dedicated towards his family.\"\n\n\"Now he has to make his decisions about which university to go to on his own,\" Amal el-Hawrani said of Ashraf. \"He was expecting to have his father's help.\"\n\nThe coronavirus has taken a devastating toll on migrant doctors across Britain, leaving at least six others dead: Dr. Habib Zaidi, 76, a longtime general practitioner from Pakistan; Dr. Alfa Sa'adu, 68, a geriatric doctor from Nigeria; Dr. Jitendra Rathod, 62, a heart surgeon from India; Dr. Anton Sebastianpillai, in his 70s, a geriatric doctor from Sri Lanka; Dr. Mohamed Sami Shousha, 79, a breast tissue specialist from Egypt; and Dr. Syed Haider, in his 80s, a general practitioner from Pakistan.\n\nBarry Hudson, a longtime patient of Dr. Zaidi in southeastern England, recalled their exam table conversations about England's cricket team.\n\n\"He was a big figure in the community,\" Mr. Hudson said. \"He had a proper doctor's manner. He didn't rush anybody.\"\n\nFor families that love to gather, grieving at a distance has been wrenching.\n\nDr. el-Tayar was buried beside his father and grandfather in Sudan, as he had wanted. But because only cargo planes were flying there, his wife and children could not accompany the coffin.\n\nAt Dr. el-Hawrani's burial, an imam said a prayer before a small, spread-out crowd, and the doctor's four living brothers and son lowered his coffin into the ground. Then they dispersed.\n\nHis brother, Amal el-Hawrani, permitted himself a single intimacy: a hug with his mother, because \"I couldn't turn that away,\" he said.\n\nThen she returned to her home in Bristol, along with a son who had visited Dr. el-Hawrani in the hospital. Fearful of passing on the virus, he had to forbid her from his room to keep her from bringing in food.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

To get the most benefit, you need to avoid these common mistakes.\n\nBy Tara Parker-Pope\n\nAlmost overnight, masks in a variety of colors, styles and materials have appeared on the faces of people around us. While it's good news that many people are doing their part to slow the spread of coronavirus, the bad news is that many people are wearing their masks wrong.\n\n\"Wearing a mask takes some getting used to, for sure,\" said Dr. Scott Segal, chairman of anesthesiology at Wake Forest Baptist Health. \"You are probably wearing it exactly right if it's a little stuffy.\"\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes people make is that they fidget with their masks, and pull them under their noses or completely off their faces to rest under their chins.\n\n\"You should absolutely not be pulling up and putting down your mask while you're out,\" said Shan Soe-Lin, a lecturer at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. \"If you're going to go to the trouble of using a mask, leave it on.\"\n\nHere are the dos and don'ts of wearing a mask.\n\n\u274cDON'T: Wear the mask below your nose.\u274cDON'T: Leave your chin exposed.\u274cDON'T: Wear your mask loosely with gaps on the sides.\u274cDON'T: Wear your mask so it covers just the tip of your nose.\u274cDON'T: Push your mask under your chin to rest on your neck.\u2714\ufe0fDO: Wear your mask so it comes all the way up, close to the bridge of your nose, and all the way down under your chin. Do your best to tighten the loops or ties so it's snug around your face, without gaps.\n\nAnd once you've figured out the correct position for wearing your mask, follow these tips to stay safe:\n\nAlways wash your hands before and after wearing a mask.\n\nUse the ties or loops to put your mask on and pull it off.\n\nDon't touch the front of the mask when you take it off.\n\nFor apartment dwellers, put the mask on and remove it while inside your home. Elevators and stairwells can be high-contamination areas.\n\nWash and dry your cloth mask daily and keep it in a clean, dry place.\n\nDon't have a false sense of security.\n\nMasks offer limited protection, and work better when combined with hand washing and social distancing. \"It's not that one excludes the other,\" said Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University. \"They compound the effects of the other.\"\n\nIllustrations by Eleni Kalorkoti", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tara_parker_pope@nytimes.com", "name": "Tara Parker-Pope", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surgical mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Institute_for_Global_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson Institute for Global Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anesthesiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Forest_Baptist_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lecturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_professor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant professor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hand washing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_Mukherjee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siddhartha Mukherjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Costumes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Paintball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Paintball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Mardi_Gras", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Mardi Gras", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 69}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/smarter-living/00well-masks-dont-promo/00well-masks-dont-promo-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.png", "eventUri": "eng-5672184", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 20316, "pinterest": 48}, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 20364, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "6025514883", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-09", "time": "00:05:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-09T00:05:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-09T00:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4705882370471954, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-race-deaths.html", "title": "Virus Is Killing Black and Latino People at Twice the Rate of Whites in N.Y.C.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe coronavirus is killing black and Latino people in New York City at twice the rate that it is killing white people, according to preliminary data released on Wednesday by the city.\n\nThe disparity reflected longstanding and persistent economic inequalities and differences in access to health care, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"There are clear inequalities, clear disparities in how this disease is affecting the people of our city,\" Mr. de Blasio said. \"The truth is that in so many ways the negative effects of coronavirus -- the pain it's causing, the death it's causing -- tracks with other profound health care disparities that we have seen for years and decades.\"\n\nThe preliminary death rate for Hispanic people in the city is about 22 people per 100,000; the rate for black people is 20 per 100,000; the rate for white people is 10 per 100,000; and the rate for Asian people is 8 per 100,000. The rates are adjusted for the size and age of the population.\n\nAnother 779 people in New York State died of the virus, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo reported on Wednesday, the second straight day that deaths spiked to new highs -- even as the mayor acknowledged that the death toll may be higher than the reported figures.\n\nMr. de Blasio said on Wednesday that there are \"100 to 200 people per day\" in the city who die at home and are presumed to be virus victims but who are not tested and are left out of the virus death toll.\n\n\"This used to be a very, very rare thing in New York City,\" the mayor said of people dying at home. \"Obviously it's jumped up, and the only thing that's changed is Covid-19.\"\n\nThere was also a glimmer of hope in the state's hospitalization figures on Wednesday: The number of virus patients in hospitals had increased by 3 percent since Tuesday, the fifth consecutive day that number had increased by less than 10 percent -- suggesting that the curve of infection may be flattening.\n\nMr. de Blasio swept into office in 2013 on a wave of rhetoric about how New York had become a bastion of inequality. Over the last six years of his administration, the mayor has set out to repair that imbalance with universal prekindergarten, increases in the minimum wage for city workers and paid sick leave.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Deaths in New York and New Jersey hit one-day highs again. The virus is disproportionately killing blacks and Hispanics in New York. New York City sues three stores it says overcharged for key items. See more updates Updated 39m ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has now illuminated other gaps between the haves and have-nots in New York City, from the availability of testing sites to the availability of beds and personal protection equipment at hospitals.\n\nIn New York City, Latinos represent 34 percent of the people who have died of the coronavirus but make up 29 percent of the city's population, according to preliminary data from the city's Health Department. Black people represent 28 percent of deaths but make up 22 percent of the population.\n\nNew York City's racial disparity in deaths is similar to that in other parts of the state, but is actually less pronounced than in other states and cities that have released racial breakdowns of coronavirus cases and deaths.\n\nIn Chicago, for example, black people account for 72 percent of virus-related fatalities, even though they make up a little less than a third of the population.\n\nMr. Cuomo said on Wednesday that some of the difference could be attributed to poorer people having more untreated chronic health problems than more-affluent individuals, making them more likely to die if they contract the virus.\n\nBut he said that black and Hispanic people may also be disproportionately represented on the front lines of workers who are at high risk.\n\n\"Are more public workers Latino and African-American?\" the governor asked. \"Who don't have a choice, frankly, but to go out there every day and drive the bus and drive the train and show up for work and wind up subjecting themselves to, in this case, the virus. Whereas many other people who had the option just absented themselves.\"\n\nMr. Cuomo committed on Wednesday to more testing in minority and low-income communities and a study to find out why the disparities exist.\n\nA study from Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, found that 75 percent of front-line workers in the city -- grocery clerks, bus and train operators, janitors and child care staff -- are minorities. More than 60 percent of people who work as cleaners are Latino, and more than 40 percent of transit employees are black.\n\nMajority black\n\nor Hispanic ZIP codes\n\nCoronavirus cases\n\nby ZIP code\n\nBronx\n\nBronx\n\nHispanic\n\nBlack\n\n100\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\nManhattan\n\nManhattan\n\nQueens\n\nQueens\n\nBrooklyn\n\nBrooklyn\n\nStaten Island\n\nStaten Island\n\nCoronavirus\n\ncases by ZIP code\n\nMajority black\n\nor hispanic ZIP codes\n\nBronx\n\nBronx\n\nHispanic\n\nBlack\n\n100\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\nManhattan\n\nManhattan\n\nQueens\n\nQueens\n\nBrooklyn\n\nBrooklyn\n\nStaten Island\n\nStaten Island\n\nCoronavirus\n\ncases by ZIP code\n\nBronx\n\n100\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\nManhattan\n\nQueens\n\nBrooklyn\n\nStaten Island\n\nMajority black\n\nor hispanic ZIP codes\n\nBronx\n\nHispanic\n\nBlack\n\nManhattan\n\nQueens\n\nBrooklyn\n\nStaten Island\n\nSources: New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; U.S. Census Bureau; socialexplorer.com\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nIf New York City is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the country, minorities and people in the city's poorest neighborhoods reside at the core.\n\nData from the Health Department shows that emergency room visits for flulike symptoms have surged in neighborhoods where the typical household income is less than the city's median of $60,000, according to an analysis of data by The New York Times. All but one of the top 20 neighborhoods with the lowest percentages of positive tests are in wealthy ZIP codes.\n\n\"We are watching, in real time, racial disparities and the pandemic of poverty,\" said Michael Blake, an assemblyman from the Bronx whose district overlaps with one of the poorest congressional districts in the country.\n\nMr. Blake and other elected officials have called on the governor and mayor to set up more rapid testing sites in places like the South Bronx and southeast Queens, as well as a field hospital and temporary housing for medical and military personnel.\n\nMr. de Blasio and Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the city's health commissioner, stressed that members of the city's Hispanic community might have been discouraged from seeking health care because of the anti-immigrant rhetoric that has dominated the national discourse in recent years.\n\n\"The overlay of the anti-immigrant rhetoric across this country, I think, has real implications in the health of our community.\" Dr. Barbot said Wednesday.\n\nMr. de Blasio said the city would increase its efforts to make sure the city's public hospitals, where many poor and uninsured people go for treatment, have all the resources they need, including ventilators and personal protective equipment. The city will also make it easier for people calling 311 to speak to a health care worker in their language about the virus.\n\n\"This is about the most essential concept of ensuring that everyone gets health care regardless of their background, regardless of their ZIP code, regardless of their income,\" Mr. de Blasio said.\n\nThe mayor had said on Tuesday that providing ethnicity data was less of a focus in a \"crisis atmosphere.\"\n\nBut Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, said that not releasing the data had caused mistrust in minority communities. \"There has been an outer-borough response to Covid-19 and a Manhattan response,\" he said. \"The allocation of resources should go to the area of higher needs.\"\n\nMalo Hutson, an associate professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation and director of the school's Urban Community and Health Equity Lab, said that the mayor's challenge to lessen the inequities exposed by the outbreak was daunting.\n\n\"It's one thing to raise the issue and say there are a disproportionate amount of blacks and low-income people who become infected with coronavirus,\" Professor Hutson said. \"It's another to turn this into policy.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeffery_c_mays@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeffery C.

Ubiquitous Services: The Mail.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- The coronavirus pandemic is ravaging the United States Postal Service, with mail volume down by nearly a third already compared to same time last year and dropping quickly, as businesses drastically cut back on solicitations, advertisements and all kinds of letters that make up the bulk of mail service's bottom line.\n\nThe falloff comes even as package delivery has surged -- but not by nearly enough to offset the losses from mail volume.\n\nThe result, the Postal Service told Congress on Thursday, is a multibillion-dollar financial shortfall that could cause one of the government's oldest and most reliable entities to run out of cash by the end of September and throw regular delivery into doubt at a time when Americans may still be trapped at home.\n\nMegan J. Brennan, the postmaster general, told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Thursday that the agency believed it would need $25 billion in federal grants to cover lost revenue from the pandemic, plus an additional $25 billion to update aging infrastructure. Another $14 billion is needed to pay off long-term debt related to the Postal Service's retirement benefits program along with $25 billion in unrestricted borrowing authority to weather the rapidly unfolding crisis, she said, according to officials familiar with the information she shared privately, who described it on condition of anonymity.\n\nEven with an increase in online shopping and package delivery to Americans cooped up at home, the agency could see a 50-percent reduction in total mail volume by the end of June, compared to the same period last year, Ms. Brennan told the lawmakers. Postal officials fear a sizable portion of that lost mail may never return.\n\nIn total, the Postal Service anticipates losing $13 billion in revenue this fiscal year because of the pandemic and another $54 billion in losses over 10 years.\n\n\"They are chilling numbers,\" said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, who leads the House subcommittee responsible for the Postal Service. \"The reaction of a lot of my colleagues -- their jaws were dropping. It is one thing to say the Postal Service is suffering. It is another to hear these specifics.\"\n\nAs Congress spends trillions of dollars to try to save private businesses with loans and grants, the Postal Service has emerged as an unusual sticking point, bogged down by a long-running debate over its future. The agency does not normally use taxpayer money, but has struggled in recent years under mounting debt.\n\nHouse Democrats are ready to give the Postal Service most of what it is asking for. But President Trump has so far rejected direct relief, repeatedly saying the Postal Service could solve its own woes simply by raising prices on packages delivered for big online retailers like Amazon.\n\nSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, squashed a bipartisan attempt to send the agency emergency funds last month, insisting instead that his department be given new authority to lend up to $10 billion to the Postal Service on terms it helps set, other officials familiar with the negotiations said.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. As millions more Americans lose their jobs, more aid from Washington is uncertain.

Even as scores of its more than 600,000 person work force have fallen ill and some have died, mail sorters and carriers have continued to walk their routes in every corner of the country, in many cases the only physical lifeline Americans now have to the outside world. They deliver medicines, election ballots, coronavirus test kits and packages ordered online.\n\nBut the administration's position has fanned fears among some lawmakers, postal union representatives and others who rely on the service that Trump administration officials are willing to let the postal network essentially go bankrupt to force its leaders to accept an overhaul to the postal business model that many conservatives have long sought -- one that could limit delivery service and aid commercial competitors like FedEx and UPS.\n\nIn a statement to The New York Times, Ms. Brennan said the Postal Service was \"at a critical juncture,\" quickly losing revenue because demand for its most profitable postal products was \"plummeting as a result of the pandemic.\"\n\n\"At a time when America needs the Postal Service more than ever, the reason we are so needed is having a devastating effect on our business,\" she said. \"The sudden drop in mail volumes, our most profitable revenue stream, is steep and may never fully recover.\"\n\nShe called on Congress to \"shore up the finances of the Postal Service, and enable us to continue to fulfill our indispensable role during the pandemic, and to play an effective role in the nation's economic recovery.\"\n\nNegotiators on Capitol Hill had reached a tentative deal last month to provide the Postal Service around $13 billion dollars in direct relief as part of the $2 trillion CARES Act. The figure would have been far below a proposal by House Democrats, but it had the buy-in of a key Republican negotiator: Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, according to the officials familiar with the talks, where were not authorized to publicly discuss them.\n\nBut Mr. Mnuchin said the administration would not have it. The Treasury secretary told lawmakers that a direct infusion of cash was a non-starter, and advocated instead for creating the $10 billion in new lending authority. Department officials did not respond to a request to comment Thursday on postal issues.\n\nMr. Connolly said Thursday that he would recommend House leadership promptly back the new, higher figures presented by the Postal Service.\n\n\"We weren't shooting for the moon. We weren't solving all the problems. We were just trying to get them through,\" Mr. Connolly said. \"The question is, will the Republicans join us?\n\nSome Republican lawmakers remain open to direct cash payments, as well, under certain circumstances. Historically, the Postal Service has counted on strong support from Republicans representing rural districts, where their service is a lifeline to homes and small businesses. But it is unclear if they would allocate the funds without imposing reform requirements on the agency or if they are willing to overpower Mr. Mnuchin and the White House.\n\nAn independent executive agency, the Postal Service has not taken federal funding in decades, running instead off revenue raised from stamps and other postal products. But since the 2008 financial crisis, it has struggled to stay in the black, weighed down largely by a congressional mandate to pre-fund its retirement benefits programs.\n\nThe agency has stopped making those payments in recent years, running up billions of dollars in debt, while its mail delivery business has otherwise remained profitable. Lawmakers in both parties have proposed overhauls to the service along the way, but none have stuck.\n\nThe postal unions and Democrats fear that the Trump administration is now trying to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis to push through a long-sought overhaul of the Postal Service that would benefit private package carriers and eliminate certain costly rural delivery routes.\n\nMr. Trump has frequently criticized the service for not charging higher prices to deliver packages for large online retailers like Amazon -- a company he has sometimes singled out in his Twitter tirades on postal issues. Aides have said the president's criticisms often followed critical stories about his administration published by the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nHe repeated the criticism this week, as he appeared to reject calls for a cash bailout. Asked about Mr. Connolly's proposal, he said the congressman should focus instead on raising package delivery prices.\n\n\"Tell your Democrat friend that he ought to focus on that, because if he focused on that, he could truly save the Post Office,\" the president said.\n\nMr. Trump ordered a review of the Postal Service and its pricing policies in 2018. His administration published the review in December of that year. Its recommendations included steps that could reduce the frequency of mail delivery and increases in the prices of sending some packages. Online retailers criticized the recommendations, which they said could particularly hurt rural customers.\n\nThe report did not spur any action in Congress last year. But a longtime congressional advocate of changes to the service, Mark Meadows of North Carolina, recently took over as Mr. Trump's chief of staff. Critics of the report fear the White House could be trying to use the pandemic as another opening.\n\n\"At the end of the day, they have an agenda,\" said Mark Dimondstein, the president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents 200,000 postal workers. \"Raise prices, reduce worker benefits, and reduce services, make it appear more profitable and set it up for sale.\"\n\n\"The Covid crisis should not be used to achieve political aims,\" he added.\n\nA lobbying group on postal issues that includes Amazon and other online retailers, the Package Coalition, raised concerns this week that the strings Treasury officials might attach to postal loans could raise prices during a pandemic that has made Americans more dependent on package delivery.\n\n\"The Treasury has the Postal Service over a $10-billion barrel, and the Postal Service is on the brink of bankruptcy,\" said the coalition's chairman, the former Army secretary John M. McHugh. \"What do you do? We're worried they'll accept the terms.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_fandos@nytimes.com", "name": "Nicholas
