Several other countries were assessing their options.\n\nCanada said 126 of its citizens live in the Wuhan area and it is consulting with allies and considering its options for getting them home.\n\nHello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the novel coronavirus originating from Wuhan in China.\n\nThis morning, the US has begun its first evacuation of citizens from Wuhan itself, in the Hubei province, where thousands of people have been affected.\n\nThe US state department confirmed to the Associated Press that 240 Americans - including diplomats and other citizens - have been airlifted out of the city, and will be flown to Anchorage in Alaska, and then to Ontario in California, 56 kilometres (35 miles) from Los Angeles.\n\nData from publicly available flight tracking site Flightaware shows that a flight operated by American cargo airline Kalitta Air left Wuhan's Tianhe airport today at 4.54 in the morning local time, and is due to touch down in Alaska in 6 hours from now.\n\nAccording to AP, all Americans will be screened for the virus in Anchorage, and could be quarantined in Ontario for up to two weeks by the US Centers for Disease Control.\n\nDavid Wert, a spokesman for the county of San Bernardino, said they were \"preparing for that eventuality just in case\".\n\nWert said that Ontario International Airport was designated a decade ago by the U.S. government to receive repatriated Americans in case of an emergency overseas.

could damage economy", "body": "Tourism, education and mining likely to be hit as Australia's biggest trade partner deals with outbreak\n\nShares in Australian companies closely linked to the Chinese economy tumbled on Tuesday morning amid fears the deadly coronavirus outbreak could smash a tourism sector already reeling from the summer's unprecedented bushfires.\n\nThe benchmark ASX200 index fell 1.6% in morning trade, following the lead set overnight by US markets, with tourism, consumer and mining stocks leading the charge downwards.\n\nAustralia's economy is heavily dependent on China, which as the country's biggest trade partner makes up 26% of its trade with the world.\n\nChina is Australia's biggest export market, particularly in tourism, with 1.5m Chinese tourists arriving every year, and education.\n\nWhile some reports estimate the damage to the Australian economy could be as much as $2.3bn, experts told Guardian Australia it was too early to be sure.\n\n\"We haven't got enough information,\" the economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin said.\n\nMcKibbin has previously estimated that a \"mild\" pandemic in Asia, such as the 1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak which killed about 1m people, would carve 0.8% from Australia's gross domestic product, with most of the damage felt in the services sector.\n\nAnd in a 2004 paper co-authored with the World Health Organisation, he estimated the 2003 Sars outbreak, which killed about 800 people, cut Australian GDP by 0.07%.\n\nCoronavirus is so far known to have killed 106 people since the outbreak of a new strain in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last month.\n\nMcKibbin said the hit to the economy would largely depend on how governments responded to the crisis.\n\n\"The virus itself has a pretty small impact in itself, but the way people respond has a larger impact,\" he said.\n\nHe said the damage would initially be felt in China-dependent industries such as tourism and mining.\n\n\"You turn off the flow of Chinese tourists for six months and that's a big economic shock.\n\n\"Australia I think has responded very well so far. They've been transparent and they've been responsible, so that's diminishing the impact domestically.\"\n\nInvestors sold down China-exposed stocks on Tuesday morning.\n\nAirline flight sales website Webjet tumbled 11%, flag carrier Qantas was down more than 5% and Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest's iron ore miner, Fortescue Metals Group, tumbled almost 8%.\n\nAustralia's two listed casino groups, which are heavily dependent on high rollers from China, also fell, with James Packer's embattled Crown Resorts dropping 4.4% and Star Entertainment Group, which runs Sydney's casino, falling 5.6%.\n\nTreasury Wine Estates, which sells wine including the top-end Penfolds Grange into the Chinese market, plunged 6.2%.\n\nAustralian airports are also likely to be hit by falling passenger numbers, ratings agency S&P said.\n\n\"The Australian airports' exposure to travellers from China is significantly higher now than it was during the Sars outbreak, accounting for over 15% of total short-term inbound travellers in 2019 compared to 4% in 2003,\" S&P said in a report issued on Thursday.\n\n\"Any decline in passenger volumes would add to the challenging operating conditions facing Australian airports, including moderating passenger volumes due to lower arrivals from China, tepid consumer confidence and the impact of the bushfires on the peak holiday season.\"\n\nThe Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director, Simon Westaway, said the virus was \"a genuine concern\" to the sector.\n\nHe said that of about $50bn spent by tourists each year, Chinese visitors made up $12bn.\n\nAbout a quarter of these arrive as part of tour groups, which Chinese authorities have banned for at least two months.\n\n\"We're receiving about 1.5m short-term arrivals a year out of China, so it's our largest inbound market,\" he said.\n\n\"So therefore there are clear challenges ahead on the basis of the sheer numbers alone, and the fact that we've built a strong relationship between our countries.\"\n\nHe said it was too early to quantify the damage.\n\n\"The concern is obviously we're going to see a reduction in terms of the number of visitors because the groups are going to fall away for the next two months.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see how it's going to recover.\"\n\nHe said the relationship between the coronavirus outbreak and the hit the tourism industry has already taken from the summer's deadly bushfires was \"not as significant as many people may believe\".\n\n\"They don't spread tourists down through to places like Mallacoota.\n\n\"There inevitably will be a level of crossover effect but we are really talking about a fairly separate market.\"\n\nRatings agency Moody's said tourism industries across the Asia-Pacific, including Australia, were likely to feel the most impact in the short term.\n\nIn a report issued on Friday, Moody's said it was too early to tell if the outbreak would cut China's growth, but warned it could hurt domestic travel and the country's car industry, which is heavily reliant on Wuhan.\n\n\"Wuhan hosts production facilities for seven major domestic and foreign manufacturers, and for hundreds of auto parts suppliers,\" Moody's said.\n\n\"Complicated supply chains and just-in-time production could mean that production outages in Wuhan factories have broader spillover effects.\"\n\nIt said the effect on consumers could be magnified because the outbreak is occurring during lunar new year, \"a period when households tend to spend more on travel, entertainment, and gifts\".\n\n\"Even if the virus is contained fairly quickly, the initial stages of high uncertainty are likely to affect spending,\" the agency said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Richard Wolffe", "body": "Jared Kushner is a genius. It's all too easy to overlook the sheer brilliance of Donald Trump's son-in-law, not least when he rolls out a Middle East peace plan that destroys the concepts of both the Israeli and Palestinian states.\n\nBut for his rapier-like ability to capture the zeitgeist, there's no one quite like the young slumlord to tell it like it really is. Speaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Kushner talked dramatically about this week as a time for leaders to step up.\n\n\"What we've done is create an opportunity for their leadership to either seize or not,\" he explained. \"If they screw up this opportunity - which again, they have a perfect track record of missing opportunities - if they screw this up, I think they will have a very hard time looking the international community in the face, saying they are the victims, saying they have rights.\"\n\nKushner thought he was talking about the Palestinians, in a gloriously brazen blend of racism and gold-leafed ignorance.\n\nBut he was in fact describing perfectly the entire caucus of Senate Republicans as they screwed up their last golden opportunity for personal redemption and liberal democracy in the impeachment trial of Donald J Trump.\n\nHow will the nation's Republican senators look anyone in the face and say they have any rights to keep in check a corrupt and criminal president? How can they pretend to be Trump's victims when they marched themselves off a constitutional cliff?\n\nAnd how on earth can they pretend to the world that their vision of America - where a president can happily use military aid to coerce a foreign government to smear his political rival in an election - is the model for democracy?\n\nLet's be honest. There was little drama or suspense in Trump's impeachment trial, save for the bat-excrement quality of crazy that tumbled out of Alan Dershowitz's mouth. According to Harvard's emeritus law professor, presidents are unimpeachable as long as they think they are acting in the national interest when they use their power to corrupt their own election.\n\nThis could have been valuable analysis for Richard Nixon, but it also serves to question the value of a Harvard law professor. Perhaps it's only the detritus who become emeritus.\n\nDershowitz claimed he said no such thing, but our eyes and ears suggested otherwise. He also said he supported Nixon's almost-impeachment, naturally. Which is to say: the Harvard man is the perfect specimen of what Trump has propagated through the body politic: a contagious coronavirus of chronic lying, cowardly ambition and plain old corruption.\n\nFor all the fake angst about calling witnesses - did Mitch McConnell wobble on the votes to stop them or is he actually manipulating the media every day? - the searing testimony of John Bolton would have done nothing, zippo, nada, to change the final vote.\n\nThe facts of Trump's corruption were never in dispute. The notion that this doesn't rise to impeachable crimes has always been a joke.\n\nWe could play the age-old parlor game of asking how our esteemed Republican senators would have responded to Barack Obama asking the French government to investigate Mitt Romney's missionary exploits ahead of the 2012 election. But what's the point?\n\nToday's Republican party elected to remove their spinal cords three years ago, along with much of their frontal lobe and their self-respect. They wring their hands in private and lament their lampoon-worthy leader whose shoes they must lick on a daily basis.\n\nBut they should know they are following in a fine tradition of the world's puppet legislators, like the People's Council of Syria and the Russian Duma under the expert guidance of one Vladimir Putin.\n\nWe should in some ways be grateful for the honesty of our pseudo-senators. \"There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven,\" said Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee senator who was supposedly considering Bolton as a witness.\n\nHaving decided the facts against Trump, Alexander then decided to trivialize his criminal acts of withholding congressionally mandated foreign aid and demanding foreign interference in his own election. According to Alexander, such stuff was simply \"inappropriate\" - much like wearing brogues to the Grand Ole Opry or asking for the fish at Top's Bar-B-Q.\n\n\"The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did,\" said the senator, elected to make decisions for the American people in one of three co-equal branches of government.\n\nFaced with so many profiles in courage, our reality TV star of a commander-in-chief will carry on regardless, seeking out fellow grifters, foreign strongmen and domestic weaklings. Will he feel liberated by the failure of the Senate trial to seek out more foreign interference in this year's election? The answer may be similar to the one about bears dumping in forests.\n\nShort of removal from office or federal indictment, there are no constraints on Trump's conduct. He can hire another goon like Rudy Giuliani to work with sketchy foreigners running businesses called something like Fraud Guarantee. Then he can shovel any amount of sketchy cash on to Facebook's mountain of money to beguile the gullible about the guaranteed fraud. Because a president can't be impeached for inappropriate crimes. And because political free speech is untouchable in the fantasy world where Mark Zuckerberg thinks he's helping humanity.\n\nThis has been a historic week for self-destructive politics. Like turkeys voting for Christmas, the British government celebrated its withdrawal from its biggest trading relationships just as Republican senators celebrated their own castration.\n\nBoth sets of magnificent morons claimed they were acting for their imaginary friends in the future: a future where Britain will once again bestride the ocean, and presidents will once again lead the free world feeling free from the fear of partisan impeachment.\n\n\"The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting 'fairness', when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress,\" tweeted the victim-in-chief sitting in the Oval Office, probably watching Fox News. \"They had 17 Witnesses, we were allowed ZERO, and no lawyers. They didn't do their job, had no case. The Dems are scamming America!\"\n\nDonald Trump doesn't know much about history, foreign policy or politics. He can't tell the difference between his own lawyers and no lawyers; between lots of witnesses and no witnesses at all. But he does know a lot about scams, and he can't wait to share them with you.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"Production declines more than 14% as carmakers face decline of exports and Brexit uncertainty\n\nBritish car manufacturing slumped to its lowest level since 2010 last year, as carmakers faced up to the decline of exports to major markets and Brexit uncertainty, which prompted factory shutdowns and weak consumer confidence.\n\nUK factories produced 1.3m cars during 2019, a decline of more than 14% on 2018, according to data published on Thursday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\n\nIt represented the third consecutive annual decline in production since 2016, the year of the EU referendum, amid a freeze in investment and shutdowns from major manufacturers preparing for multiple Brexit deadlines that never actually arrived.\n\nMike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive, said: \"The fall of UK car manufacturing to its lowest level in almost a decade is of grave concern.\"\n\nBritish exports to all major markets fell. Exports to the US and the EU fell by 9.8% and 11.1% respectively compared to 2018, but output destined for Asian markets, previously key sources of growth, fell more steeply. Production for Japan fell by 17.7%, while for China it was down 26.4%.\n\nThat production slump came before the coronavirus outbreak that is expected to stop car sales in many regions for weeks, adding another unexpected problem for carmakers already struggling with the decline of diesel sales and the heavy investments required to produce electric vehicles. The virus could also have knock-on effects on supply chains; Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, is a major centre of the Chinese automotive industry.\n\nOf the mass-market manufacturers in the UK, the worst performer was Honda. Production of the Civic at its Swindon plant, earmarked for closure next year, fell by 32%.\n\nProduction at Nissan's Sunderland plant, which lost out on building the new X-Trail SUV and Infiniti luxury brand, fell by 22%. Output also fell by a fifth from Vauxhall's Astra plant at Ellesmere Port, which is at high risk of closure if the UK does not achieve a good Brexit deal.\n\nDespite the overall fall in production, the share of British-made cars bound for the EU rose to 54.8% of all UK output. Hawes said this showed that reaching a trade deal with the EU is by far the overriding priority for the industry. A trade deal with the US is \"nowhere near as important\", he said.\n\nInvestment in the automotive sector recovered to \u00a31.1bn during 2019, after enduring a dire 2018. However, that was still below the seven-year average, and a single investment by Jaguar Land Rover, Britain's largest carmaker, accounted for almost its entirety. JLR production also fell by 14%.\n\n\"The most disturbing thing we've seen in the last few years has been this reduction in investment,\" Hawes said.\n\n\"The reputation of the UK needs to be re-established as a good place to invest,\" he added. \"It's been damaged. I don't know if it's permanent.\"\n\nProduction of alternatively fuelled vehicles rose by 34.7% during the year, in a rare bright spot for the industry. That included pure battery electric vehicles such as the Sunderland-built Nissan Leaf, but the majority of those were hybrid cars, combining internal combustion engines with battery electric power.",

evacuated, authorities say. People who are sick will not be able to travel to Christmas Island.\n\nAustralian authorities are now confirming what they know about how people can catch the virus: \"In terms of walking past people in the street who may or may not be infected. That is also totally virtually safe. We're talking about really close contact over a period of time. That's an important message that people should take.\"\n\nAustralian authorities are holding a press conference on the country's response to the virus outbreak, including quarantining any citizens airlifted out of China on Christmas Island for 14 day. The island is where Australia has previously detained refugees and asylum arriving in the country by boat.\n\nLet's have a look at those new figures that have been announced. The total number of deaths is confirmed to be 170. This is up from 132 reported on Wednesday, and is a rise of of 29%.\n\nInfections now stand at 7,183, up from 5,974 - a rise of 20%.\n\nIt's understood that 162 of the deaths - or 95% - are in Hubei province, where the outbreak started.\n\nNews outlets are reporting that 4,586 cases of infections are also in Hubei. That's 64% of infections.\n\nGood morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, I'm Alison Rourke.\n\nThe daily jumps in the death toll inside China have continued, with authorities announcing a new figures of 170 fatalities. All but eight of those are in Hubei province, where the outbreak began. Infections stand at 7, 183.\n\nI'll bring you some analysis on those figures shortly and how they fit into what seems to be a trend of increases over the past few days.\n\nIn the mean time, here's a summary of the other key points so far:\n\nThe World Health Organization says all countries must be on alert for the virus. The WHO's emergency committee will meet again on Thursday. The US and Japan have already flown out some of their citizens out of Wuhan. UK citizens have been told they will not be airlifted on Thursday. When they return, they may be kept in quarantine for 14 days. Some major airlines, including British Airways, have suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China.\n\nAs always, you can get in touch with me via email: alison.rourke@theguardian.com or on Twitter @AlisonRourke", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alison_rourke@theguardian.com", "name": "Alison Rourke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christmas Island"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Christmas Island"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38af209bb6f40ee362ee064a2fa9003f927b1e95/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&s=9a1f53ce74f5fc7dc65d45e7c16b37ca", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 22}, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 22, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1430625024", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-31", "time": "17:55:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-31T17:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-31T17:16:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4235294163227081, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/our-face-mask-future-do-they-really-help-beat-flu-coronavirus-and-pollution", "title": "Our face mask future: Do they really help beat flu, coronavirus and pollution?", "body": "Huge numbers of people are wearing face masks - in Japan and South Korea there have been reports of stores selling out. But experts are divided on how effective they are\n\nAs the death toll from coronavirus steadily rises, east Asian countries such as Taiwan have stepped up production of surgical face masks to meet demand. In the Chinese city of Wuhan, at the centre of the outbreak, it is mandatory to wear one in public places, and there have been reports of stores in Japan and South Korea selling out.\n\nThe hope is that wearing masks in high-risk areas will at least slow the spread of the disease, but just how helpful they are is moot. Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales, has been reviewing the literature on protocol for dealing with infectious diseases and finds it wanting.\n\n\"There are two ways that a virus can be spread through the respiratory route of coughing or sneezing,\" says MacIntyre. \"One is through large droplets that you can see or feel when somebody sneezes or coughs in your face. They land very quickly and, if you are in their path, you can get contaminated.\"\n\nIn hospital infection control, she says, \"we are told that we can stand one to two metres from the patient, and we'll be fine\". But this is based on data from the 1940s. \"It's a bit like believing the Earth is flat.\" More recent studies, she adds, \"suggest that the distance the large droplets can travel is further than two metres. One study showed up to six metres.\"\n\nThe second way that viruses spread through the respiratory route is via tiny airborne particles, also referred to as aerosols. \"They come from deep in the lungs, not from the throat and the nose,\" says MacIntyre, \"and those particles for some viruses can even come out with normal breathing.\"\n\nThey tend to stay hovering in the air for longer, you can't see or feel them and they travel further than the large droplets. \"There have been studies of influenza in emergency departments,\" says MacIntyre, \"and three hours after a patient with flu has left, the virus is still in the air.\"\n\n\"A lot of viruses are shed in the faecal material,\" she adds, recalling a case in a Hong Kong apartment building during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003. \"Because of malfunctions in the plumbing when the toilet was flushed, the virus aerosolised through the air-conditioning and an open window, and into other floors in the building as well as the building next door.\"\n\nEven a larger droplet, she says, \"in its trajectory from the mouth starts decreasing in size because of evaporation, and it could end up an airborne particle\". Surgical masks are only expected to help protect against larger droplets, and are designed not to protect the wearers themselves from germs but the open wounds of patients on operating tables. But even studies looking at whether they sufficiently protect patients in this way have not been able to prove their efficacy.\n\nFurthermore, says MacIntyre, \"surgical masks are not regulated. Anyone can sell anything and call it a surgical mask. The filtration level of the material is not regulated.\"\n\nThere is some speculation over whether wearing basic fabric masks over a warm, wet mouth may breed infection rather than deter it, but Catherine Makison Booth, a microbiologist at the UK's Health and Safety Laboratory, says she wouldn't have thought so. The main issue, she says, is that \"they're not tightly fitting, and they're not necessarily filtering out aerosol [airborne particles]\".\n\nMakison Booth is best known for creating a dummy called \"Vomiting Larry\" during the norovirus outbreak of 2013. Larry could projectile-vomit liquid as impressively as a real human, and therefore provide data on the myriad contamination risks involved in attempting to clean up the mess.\n\nIn 2008, Makison Booth set out to discover to what extent surgical masks could protect wearers. She hooked up one of her dummies to a resuscitation machine, \"so it breathed\", she says. She then sealed it in a cabinet and sprayed tiny airborne droplets - a simulated sneeze - containing influenza at it while it wore a series of protective masks.\n\nDifferent designs of surgical mask were tested, including the standard strip of fabric, a duck-bill-shaped one and a 3D moulded one. \"They conferred a low level of protection to the wearer,\" she says, diplomatically. The virus was found inside all the masks, but they had provided something like a six-fold decrease in the amount of virus exposure.\n\nWearing a substandard mask may at least deter wearers from self-contaminating by putting their hands to their noses or mouths, but we can self-contaminate by touching our eyes, too. \"We know that in the markets in Wuhan,\" says MacIntyre, \"they found coronavirus all over the surfaces, so someone walking through could touch it and contaminate themselves.\"\n\nMakison Booth also tested disposable filtering facepiece (FFP) respirators. They are designed to filter tiny particulates, and are recommended in the UK for professionals working under possible exposure to airborne diseases. These provided 100 times more protection than going barefaced.\n\nHowever, truly protecting yourself isn't as simple as buying any old FFP. There is a dizzying array on offer, with confusingly similar names, and in the west they are more likely to be marketed for pollution than disease. \"N95\" types are heavily promoted online. Makison Booth says this is the US equivalent of the UK's second-most-effective model, imaginatively called the FFP2. However, she says, \"we recommend the use of an FFP3 [the highest protection available] because it will filter out more particles\". The US versions are tested only for dry particulates, she says, but the UK FFPs are tested against liquid in aerosols, too. Before you buy any mask, make sure it has a CE certification mark, which indicates conformity with EU health, safety and environmental protection standards.\n\nThere is little point in wearing one without testing that it fits properly, and most manufacturers sell fit-testing kits. \"Areas such as the bridge of your nose to your cheek and under the chin are often places where air will leak through, rather than going through the filter material,\" says Makison Booth. A standard test involves wearing the respirator, placing a plastic hood around your head and spraying saccharin solution inside it. \"If you've got a leak, then you will be able to taste the sweetness,\" she says.\n\nBasic surgical-style masks are more popular than ever, and what was once a symbol of pandemic panic has become an everyday accessory. In December, before this latest global health emergency was declared, members of the K-pop group BTS were papped arriving in New York in their trademark off-duty look of expensive coats, immaculate hair and surgical masks.\n\nFor young people in east Asia, where wearing protective masks in public for a variety of reasons has been acceptable for a century, they have become cool. They accentuate the eyes, and add mystique to Instagram-filtered selfies - and the moulded versions, as opposed to the classic strip tied across the lower face, look pleasingly futuristic. They come in different colours and patterns, from camouflage to Hello Kitty. BTS merch stores sell branded masks.\n\nMitsutoshi Horii, a professor at Shumei University in Japan, now based at Chaucer College in Canterbury, wrote a sociology research paper in 2014 looking at the history of face-mask-wearing in Japan. He has never worn one, but his mother has taken to the custom in recent winters. This is not primarily for fear of infection, but because, he says, \"during the winter, her throat gets dry, and it keeps her face warm\".\n\nTheir popularity is still growing in Japan, not least because there is a greater emphasis than ever before, from governments and medics, on taking responsibility for your own health.\n\nAlthough the title of his paper is Why Do the Japanese Wear Masks?, Horii says an equally interesting question is why don't westerners? He discovered that masks were promoted by authorities across the world during the 1918 Spanish flu crisis that killed 50 million people. But in the west, particularly the US, \"there was a huge public rejection. It went against their ideology of liberalism, the belief in freedom of individuals.\"\n\nIn Japan, says Horii, people didn't mind wearing masks, and at the time, the Japanese government was encouraging more western behaviour, suppressing local flu prevention rituals involving things such as lucky charms, and pushing a more rational approach. Over time, the masks acquired other uses. From the 1960s, Japanese people started using them for hay fever, rather than deal with the unpleasant side-effects of antihistamines. Then, more recently, Sars, swine flu and urban pollution further increased demand.\n\nIn China, too, says MacIntyre, \"you see families going for their Sunday stroll wearing masks even without any pandemic being present, sometimes because of pollution. In western cultures, even in healthcare settings, there's very low compliance when it comes to mask-wearing.\"\n\nIt is pollution that has encouraged the slow trickle of mainstream mask-wearing in the west. In London the other day, Horii spotted a white man sporting one on the underground, although the look still has mildly apocalyptic associations in western countries.\n\nUrban cyclists have been the biggest adopters, and companies such as Freka facewear offer ergonomic masks with replaceable particulate filters in jazzy designs. There's no evidence yet as to how much they help. It's unlikely that consumers are fit testing them before using them, and, even if the masks are catching some particulates, they can't stop noxious gases such as nitrogen dioxide, whereas there is good evidence for the benefits of sticking to quieter, less polluted side roads.\n\nHorii says that a major motivating factor for mask use in Japan is being courteous towards other people. \"If you have a cold, you have to take care not to infect others, therefore you cover your mouth,\" he says.\n\nMasks have also become what he calls a \"risk ritual\", providing a sense of control over an uncontrollable situation. Just as we can't avoid being exposed to pollution in cities, he says, \"flu is a force of nature. You get it when you get it, but by doing something at least you feel you are taking control.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

go to Christmas Island", "body": "An Australian man currently under lockdown in Wuhan says the government's proposal to quarantine Australians in the Christmas Island detention centre is \"outrageous\" and would probably prevent many people from travelling back to Australia.\n\nRui Severino, a racehorse trainer from Melbourne, who has lived in China for the last four years, also criticised the Australian government for charging Australians to be transported to Christmas Island, saying he didn't think it was a \"fair move\".\n\nSeverino received a call from Australian embassy officials offering him transport home, but declined, saying he intended to remain in Wuhan, where he says he feels relatively safe and has a responsibility to his team of horse trainers and horses.\n\n\"I just couldn't leave my team behind, these horses and these people, they put their trust in me every day, I could not turn my back on them,\" he said over the phone from Wuhan.\n\nSeverino said he was in favour of the Australian government quarantining people and taking steps to protect others from the outbreak but said putting people \"behind bars\" in the detention facility at Christmas Island was not acceptable.\n\n\"These are families with mothers, children, and they're going to a detention centre to be behind bars, to be behind barbed wire? That's not really nice, I don't think.\"\n\n\"I'm sure they could find somewhere else to put these people,\" he said.\n\nChristmas Island, located 2,600km from the Australian mainland in the Indian Ocean, is the site of a notorious immigration detention facility that currently houses a single family: a Tamil couple and their two Australian-born children who are currently fighting their deportation from Australia.\n\nThose who are evacuated on a charter flight from Wuhan will be quarantined in the detention centre for up to 14 days, the internationally recognised incubation period for the virus.\n\n\"It's just outrageous really. It's not a matter of being outrageous, you wouldn't even think about it, no country would have even thought about it. Other countries are going to put people in hospitals and proper medical centres and proper medical set-ups.\"\n\nSeverino only knows one other Australian in Wuhan. She was also contacted by Australian officials about travelling home, but told Severino she was \"definitely not going under that situation\", something he suspected would be true for many Australians, who would prefer to remain under lockdown in Wuhan than spend up to 14 days on Christmas Island.\n\nHowever, Severino said that if he really feared his life was in danger, he would make the trip.\n\n\"If you feared for your life you'd go anywhere, wouldn't you? I would,\" he said.\n\nSeverino was also critical of reports that the Australian government was charging people $1,000 to fly to Christmas Island, saying: \"I don't think that's a fair move at all. If you're talking about repatriation, if the government decides for whatever reason to evacuate people, whether it's from a war, from a natural calamity, whatever it is, I don't think costs should be mentioned, that's my personal opinion.\"\n\nSeverino, who lives in a residential area about 15 minutes from the centre of Wuhan, also described the impact of the outbreak on his daily life in the city.\n\nAfter leaving his building compound each day, he has his temperature checked and has to declare where he is travelling to. Upon arrival at the training centre where he works, just a five-minute drive away, Severino undergoes another temperature check and is placed in an ultraviolet room for disinfection.\n\nHe said the sight of deserted streets was \"surreal\", given how busy Wuhan, which has a population of roughly 11 million people, normally is.\n\n\"Yesterday I went to the centre of the little town where I live and it's always full, it's always packed out of people and I was the only one person walking down the street at 5:30 in the afternoon, it was quite surreal,\" he said.\n\nHe estimated that 90% of shops had not reopened since lunar new year and those shops that were open had been cleared out of food.\n\n\"Yesterday I attempted to [go shopping] and there was only one shop open, of course everybody obviously goes to that shop, so there weren't many things left, but I managed to buy some vegetables,\" he said. \"There have been some small supermarkets and small stores open but at the moment everyone is on pretty much rice, dumplings and vegetables.\"\n\nSeverino spends his days at work and his nights shut inside at home, watching TV, cooking and video-calling his sons who live in Australia. He says he has been impressed with how quickly the Chinese government put measures into place in response to the outbreak, and emphasises how calm people are in the city.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it, how quick these measures came into place and how everyone is obeying by these rules. Everyone is scared, you know, I'm not going to say no one's scared, but everyone is calm. It's not a Hollywood movie, it's not a frantic situation.\"\n\nAs of Thursday evening, there were seven confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

from China to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan", "body": "Australia is yet to gain permission from the Chinese government to evacuate hundreds of citizens trapped in the coronavirus-hit city of Wuhan, despite the US and other countries having already been granted access to the region.\n\nAs some people on Christmas Island express fears of becoming a \"leper colony\" after the government said it would be used to quarantine evacuees, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, confirmed on Thursday morning that officials were still to win the \"agreement of Chinese authorities for this process\".\n\n\"This is a process we are undertaking with Chinese authorities and as both the prime minister and I indicated yesterday it requires the seeking of formal approval,\" she told ABC Radio. \"Those discussions are under way through the ministry of foreign affairs and also through our temporary consular team in Wuhan.\"\n\nAsked why Australia was still in negotiations while other nations had already begun the evacuation process, Payne said the government did not have a consular presence in Wuhan, meaning it was forced to relocate officials from Shanghai.\n\nGlobally there are now more than 6,000 confirmed cases of the respiratory illness, including more than 130 deaths, mainly in Wuhan, while seven cases have been diagnosed in Australia.\n\nPayne said the government would prioritise isolated vulnerable people in the area. More than 600 citizens have registered as being in Hubei province.\n\nIn response to the crisis, Scott Morrison announced on Wednesday that evacuees would be quarantined on Christmas Island for 14 days, a decision that has angered some locals.\n\nThe Christmas Island shire president, Gordon Thomson, told Guardian Australia the decision to use the territory reflected \"regressive colonialist treatment\".\n\nAlready a critic of the government's use of the island to detain asylum seekers, Thomson said he had learned of the plan by seeing it on the news and was worried that \"now we'll be a leper colony\".\n\nPeter Dutton defended the plan on Thursday, saying it was designed to keep the broader population safe.\n\n\"I can't clear a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne to accommodate 600 people,\" the home affairs minister told the Nine Network on Thursday. \"We don't have a facility otherwise that can take this number of people. I want to make sure that we keep Australians safe.\"\n\nDutton said the plan had been hatched in consultation with Australia's chief medical officer, who receives frequent advice from the World Health Organization.\n\nGiven the concerns from Christmas Island residents, Dutton later told reporters that evacuees would be kept in an isolation area until they received medical clearance.\n\n\"My clear message to people on Christmas Island is we won't be using the medical centre or the health facilities on Christmas Island,\" he said. \"We won't be utilising other areas, common areas, on Christmas Island.\"\n\nDutton also dismissed Thomson's criticism, describing him as a \"member of the Labor party\". He said the government had tried to contact him on Wednesday before the decision was announced.\n\nThe opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said it was unclear whether the decision to use the remote territory was \"motivated by a genuine belief that's the only option or embarrassment the government opened Christmas Island\".\n\nQantas has offered its aircraft for use in the evacuation, which is a joint operation with New Zealand. But the design of the island's runaway means that it cannot land with a full passenger load.\n\nThe airline is reportedly looking at landing a passenger plane on the mainland, before transferring the evacuees to Christmas Island using a smaller aircraft.\n\nIt is also still considering whether to halt flights to China after British Airways took that step this week.\n\nDutton said on Thursday that was a decision for Qantas. The airline was contacted for comment.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the New Zealand foreign minister, Winston Peters, cast doubt on a mooted plan to coordinate its own evacuation efforts with Australia.\n\nPeters said officials from both countries would continue discussions in Wuhan on Thursday, but added that the New Zealanders would be quarantined in their home country and not on Christmas Island.\n\nThe Australian government has confirmed that those evacuated will have to contribute financially to the trip.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

"body": "The Morrison government has backtracked on a contentious plan to charge people $1,000 for their evacuation from China to help contain the spread of the coronavirus, while Peter Dutton has departed from the government script by urging Australians planning an overseas holiday to stay home instead.\n\nWith senior government figures on Sunday warning the pandemic will, alongside the drought and the bushfires, create a significant hit on the Australian economy, the home affairs minister urged Australians to spend their money at home.\n\n\"We need Australians, frankly, if they are considering a holiday at the moment, to reconsider whether an outbound overseas trip is what they want to do,\" Dutton told Sky News. \"If they've thought about seeing parts of Australia, now might be a good time to book that holiday.\"\n\nThe government's official travel advice, thus far, covers travel to and from China, which is the epicentre of the virus. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, told reporters later in the morning he wasn't part of any \"discussion\" with Dutton before his remarks, \"but I think it's always sensible when you're planning to travel to consider the health advisories at the time\".\n\n\"But at the moment, the medical advice is principally around China.\"\n\nAs well as departing from the official travel advice, Dutton also appeared unaware during his interview on Sunday morning that the government had dumped the plan to charge people for their evacuations to Christmas Island. He said cost recovery was \"common sense\" and he noted \"most people will have paid much more than that for a return commercial flight\".\n\nThe health minister Greg Hunt later told reporters the mix up happened because \"the point was that the treasurer was announcing it this morning\".\n\nThe government late on Saturday implemented significant border control measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus. Scott Morrison announced that foreign arrivals from mainland China will not be allowed entry into Australia. Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family, legal guardians and spouses will be excepted from the strict measure.\n\nWhile the government advised last week it would apply cost recovery to looming evacuations from China, Josh Frydenberg said on Sunday that would no longer be the case. He blamed the about face on the foreign affairs department, which he said had given the government incorrect information about past practices.\n\nThe government had said previous governments had charged for airlifts such as those run out of Lebanon in 2006, and Egypt in 2011. But this was fiercely contested.\n\nFormer prime minister Kevin Rudd, foreign minister at the time of the Arab Spring and the Egyptian evacuation, said online: \"Morrison's claim that Labor charged Australians for tickets on charter flights out of Egypt during the 2011 uprising is an outright falsehood\".\n\n\"The cost (about $3400 per person) was borne by the government. Why is 'Scotty from Marketing' slugging Aussies to get them out of Wuhan?\"\n\nThe prime minister Julia Gillard said in a media release \"the charter will be provided free of charge\", and the then head of the department of foreign affairs and trade, Dennis Richardson, confirmed at Senate estimates the costs of the charter were all borne by the government.\n\nFrydenberg said the government was still working with the Chinese government to determine when the first plane removing people to quarantine in Christmas Island would proceed. \"We hope that approval is imminent,\" the treasurer said.\n\nFrydenberg was asked on the ABC on Sunday whether the various hits on the economy could result in a negative quarter of growth, given growth was already weak before the disasters of the summer.\n\nThe treasurer said he did not intend to speculate. He noted the economy had been resilient to date, but there were now many factors beyond the government's control.\n\n\"There are things that we can control and things that we can't control,\" he said. \"When it comes to the outbreak of the virus, when it comes to the fires, when it comes to the floods, when it comes to the trade tensions between the United States and China - we can't control those factors - but it does underline the importance of our disciplined economic management.\"\n\nFrydenberg refused to say whether he would, in the circumstances, be able to deliver a budget surplus, despite declaring definitively last year that the budget was back in the black.\n\nHe said the government's primary focus was not on the number, but on \"delivering the support to the Australians who need it\".\n\nAsked whether he got a bit carried away in the lead-up to the election in declaring repeatedly \"the budget is back in the black\", when the government had not yet delivered a surplus, and the economy was exposed to a number of external shocks, Frydenberg said the government had delivered a balanced budget, and \"that's a significant achievement\".\n\n\"In terms of a surplus, you'll have to tune in on budget night,\" he said. \"What we do know is that these events outside of our control are going to have a significant impact on the Australian economy\".\n\nWith economic growth now imperilled because of the calamities of the summer, Dutton told Sky News the government was looking at measures to help the tourism sector, which has been hit by people staying away in the peak holiday seasons because of the bushfires, and now the impact of the virus. \"The government will have more to say in due course,\" he said.\n\n\"There is no question this will have an impact on the economy, but the first priority for the government at this point is the health and wellbeing of Australians,\" Dutton said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

He described his long journey back to the UK after being evacuated on Friday.\n\nSpeaking from his room at Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, where he and 82 other Britons will be quarantined for two weeks in NHS staff accommodation, he said he was \"very tired\" after a 30 hour journey but grateful to have been evacuated.\n\nThe 32-year-old man, who asked not to be named, described the facilities where he was staying:\n\n\"It's like being in a crap hotel or a student halls of residence. I haven't actually asked but I suspect I'm not really supposed to come out here in the next 14 days. It's alright though. It will be OK.\"\n\nHere is the full story:\n\nReuters is reporting that the northern Chinese city of Tianjin has ordered schools and non-essential companies to remain closed until further notice to curb the spread of the coronavirus that has already infected thousands in the country, a local government-run newspaper said.\n\nTianjin Daily, said the date when work and school could resume would be announced at a later stage, citing a local government committee responsible for controlling the epidemic.\n\nTianjin, which has a population of around 15 million and borders capital Beijing, had 32 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of 10pm local time on 31 January.\n\nHello and welcome to our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHere is a quick summary of where we are up to:\n\nThe number of confirmed deaths from China's coronavirus outbreak has risen to 258, as authorities in hardest-hit Hubei province reported 45 new fatalities. Cases of infection in China now stand at more than 11,000 The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. It has also announced it will temporarily bar entry to the US for people travelling from China unless they are Americans or immediately related to US citizens. Two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. They are being treated in Newcastle. The Foreign Office said it was 'aware of frustrations' of Brits who had wanted to leave Wuhan but proved unable to board the evacuation plane. Michael Gove told Sky News the government would send another plane to Wuhan to evacuate British nationals if needed. Russia has reported its first two cases of coronavirus. Russia's deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova told reporters the infected people were Chinese citizens who had been isolated. The plane carrying 83 Britons to the UK from Wuhan in China landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and the evacuees were driven to a facility on the Wirral where they will stay in quarantine for the next 14 days. Thailand has recorded its first human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus after a taxi driver was apparently infected by a traveller. The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. It has also announced it will temporarily bar entry to the US for people traveling from China. A plan to evacuate Australians stranded in China is likely to go ahead over the weekend, the AAP news agency is reporting.\n\nHere is our latest news wrap:", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

to handle an epidemic", "body": "A patient presents at an emergency department somewhere in the world. They are feverish and vomiting. Doctors suspect it is influenza, but they are wrong.\n\nWhen the outbreak of a virulent new disease such as the coronavirus is identified, the starting gun is fired on a vast, multimillion-dollar international effort to try to contain it.\n\nBut nothing can start before a health professional determines that, against the odds, they are confronting something exceptional. \"You need to work through that process, establish that this is an out-of-the-ordinary disease and say, let's do lab tests on it,\" says Jonathan Quick, an adjunct professor of global health and author of the End of Epidemics.\n\nSometimes the signs are clear: health workers becoming infected, or patients growing sicker or dying faster than expected.\n\nOther cases rely on a hunch. In 2003, the Italian specialist Carlo Urbani was asked to examine a patient in a Vietnamese hospital with symptoms of influenza. Urbani saw a different pattern. He commissioned tests, reinforced infection controls around the patient and alerted the World Health Organization.\n\nA global alert for a virus named Sudden acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) was declared 12 days later. Urbani died from it the following month.\n\nAdvances in medical science by the late 1960s led some experts to declare that humanity had conquered infectious diseases. It was wishful thinking. Two decades into the 21st century, viruses are breaking out more frequently than in the past, data shows.\n\nOne factor is that humans are spreading into territories we have never lived in before, bringing us into contact with animal populations carrying diseases our bodies never learned to fight.\n\nThe 2014 Ebola outbreak was formally identified more than two and a half months after it was first detected. The 2015-16 epidemic of zika,the mosquito-borne virus that led to 3,000 severe birth defects, took 37 days. The disease always gets a head start, and not just for biological reasons. An epidemic may be a medical phenomenon, but it is social and political too.\n\n'Your rate of growth needs to be less than one'\n\nIn the crucible of an outbreak, sharing information is one of the most important factors in saving lives. But instincts often lead the other way. When Sars emerged in China in November 2002, it raged for several months before Beijing alerted the WHO.\n\n\"China actively hid Sars from the international community and the WHO was really disempowered,\" says Alexandra Phelan, an adjunct professor at the Georgetown law school.\n\nThe same urgent need for transparency applies to scientists studying the disease, some of whom have been incentivised in the past to withhold important findings in a crisis for fear they may not be able to publish them in medical journals later.\n\nThe impulse for secrecy even extended to Liberian villages afflicted with Ebola, where out of fear and mistrust some families would hide sick or deceased relatives from medical teams.\n\n\"Information sharing is what it's all about,\" says Rebecca Katz, the director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University. \"If you don't know something is happening, you can't stop it.\"\n\nOnce an outbreak is identified, the focus can shift to stopping its spread, which in theory is straightforward. \"Your rate of growth needs to be less than one,\" says Joshua Ginsberg, the president of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Science. \"If every person who gets the disease gives it to slightly less than one person, then the disease will go away.\"\n\nThat requires determining who is already sick, and who may become so. Hospitals become vigilant for symptoms of the disease in new patients, while teams are sent out into communities to enlist them to report anyone showing the telltale signs - and in some cases, to prevent those people from making the journey to a clinic themselves.\n\n\"If a disease is highly contagious, if people are coming to the hospital it probably means they've contaminated a lot of people on the way,\" says Michel Yao, a physician who advises the Democratic Republic of the Congo's health ministry on its Ebola response.\n\nInfected people take part in a process known as contact tracing: listing everyone they have interacted with in the past days or weeks, and for how long. Those lists can be vast - a 2011 study found every measles case generated sometimes hundreds of contacts that needed to be investigated. But when Ebola hit Africa's most populous country, Nigeria, contact tracing and surveillance networks that were already in place to combat polio helped to stop the outbreak in its tracks.\n\nMedical teams managed to reach every Nigerian case and seven deaths were reported in the country of 181 million people. \"Because they had that system in place, they were able to jump in immediately and figure out, where did this patient go, who did he talk to? And isolate those people,\" says Ashley Arabasadi, a policy adviser at the US-based Management Sciences for Health institute.\n\nQuarantining cities, as China has done to Wuhan in response to the coronavirus outbreak, can often make the epidemic worse, according to some experts.\n\n\"It causes mistrust in the government and panic and concern,\" Phelan says. \"People can't access healthcare because public transport is shut down. Or they may do the opposite and overwhelm medical facilities. And how do you get in food and drugs for other non-coronavirus issues? It is a very heavy-handed move that has no evidence base behind it.\"\n\n'One or more could have collapsed'\n\nBlunting the spread of an epidemic is difficult enough in wealthy states with strong governments and developed health systems, but when Ebola broke out in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea in January 2014, the three countries were quickly overwhelmed.\n\n\"It was actually possible that one or more [of their governments] could have collapsed,\" says Beth Cameron, a health security specialist who served on the task force established by Barack Obama to fight the disease.\n\nNed Price, another Obama administration official who worked on the Ebola response, recalled a meeting in the White House situation room that August, when those assembled, including Obama himself, were shown the worst possible outcome.\n\n\"It showed 1.5 million active cases by the end of January 2015,\" Price says. \"There was shock. I forget if there were audible gasps, but people were definitely gasping on the inside.\"\n\nWhen Ebola cases appeared in the US, Spain and Britain, it was clear the world was only as strong as its weakest health system. About 2,800 US troops were deployed to west Africa alongside soldiers and health workers from the region and around the world, to treat the sick, test for others who might have the disease and prevent it from spreading.\n\nBy the end of the year, Price says, the daily reports the White House was receiving started to show the number of new transmissions falling. \"There was a moment in late 2014 where it became apparent the intervention was working,\" he says.\n\nMore than 11,000 people died in the three worst-affected countries, but the disease continues to roil the DRC, where more than 2,200 have died so far.\n\n'The number-one thing is not to politicise the disease'\n\nOne of the keys to beating an epidemic has little to do with a country's wealth or infrastructure. The most effective vaccines and public-health programmes are useless if a population does not trust those trying to fight the disease.\n\nSources of misinformation have proliferated. \"Ebola literally set Twitter records in terms of the number of posts about it,\" says Quick. \"And when we looked at what was on there, a lot of it was false stuff, and people were more likely to believe downright fictions on social media than they were official sources.\"\n\nStigma is another deadly accelerant for any outbreak. \"The worst thing for an epidemic is for it to start in what are considered the 'social evils',\" says Quick, who worked extensively on the Aids epidemic, which has killed an estimated 32 million people since the virus was identified in the 1980s.\n\nHe recalls the resistance among conservatives in the US to public-health measures such a needle exchanges, and within the gay community, the reluctance to share lists of people they had had sexual contact with for the purposes of tracing the disease's spread.\n\n\"They were so distrustful, with good reason, that they wouldn't participate,\" Quick says. \"The number-one thing is not to politicise the disease.\"\n\nLeaders in the fight against the 2014 Ebola outbreak turned to anthropologists to explain that burial practices, including ritually washing the dead, were helpingto spread the virus. They recommended small changes that reduced hostility between health workers and communities.\n\n\"The first wave of human remains were dealt with through cremation, which is not how people in those areas bury their dead,\" says Arabasadi. \"It was also discovered that if the treatment facilities had windows, or a fence where your family could visit you and give you food, that impacted where people would go.\"\n\nAdvances in machine learning are honing the science of predicting future outbreaks. \"Our goal is to have the real-time ability to look at human traits, ecological traits and those of animals that are reservoirs for these diseases, and be able to say: we think there is going to be an Ebola outbreak, in the eastern Congo, in the next six-to-eight months,\" says Ginsberg. \"That's the dream.\"\n\nBut technology will not eradicate diseases. The best that can be done is to strengthen local health systems to contain them as close to the source as possible, Arabasadi says. \"It is very hard to get people to fund preparedness because the measure of success is a non-event, and that's hard to get excited about,\" she says. \"But investments in health systems will have a huge rate of return, including on things that aren't outbreak-related, like better maternal care and less infant mortality.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Officials said four of the passengers - a woman and three men - had coughs and fevers and had been taken to a hospital in separate ambulances for treatment and further tests.\n\nThe government's top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said there was no confirmation yet of whether they were infected with the virus.\n\nPressure is mounting on China to control the spread of the disease. The country's national health commission on Wednesday said the total number of deaths from the flu-like virus rose by 26 on Tuesday, with almost all of the new cases in Hubei province, which is under virtual lockdown.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases rose to a total of 5,974 - overtaking the 5,327 confirmed cases in mainland China during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic. The Sars outbreak killed more than 770 people globally, including 349 in mainland China.\n\nOfficials in the US, meanwhile, said a chartered plane had left Wuhan earlier on Wednesday with about 200 US citizens onboard, including staff from the local US consulate.\n\n\"These travellers will be carefully screened and monitored to protect their health, as well as the health and safety of their fellow Americans,\" US state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.\n\nAustralia said on Wednesday it would help \"vulnerable or isolated\" citizens leave Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, and quarantine them on Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean that is home to a controversial detention centre for asylum seekers.\n\nBritain is finalising plans to repatriate citizens from in and around Wuhan. The European Union will fly its citizens out aboard two French planes this week, and South Korea was due to do the same. Several other countries were assessing their options.\n\nOne of the Japanese passengers, Takeo Aoyama, said he was relieved to be home. \"We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly and we were still in the city,\" Aoyama, wearing a surgical mask, said at Haneda airport in Tokyo.\n\n\"We were not able to move freely, so we only had partial information. The restrictions on the flow of goods and transport were extremely strict.\"\n\nAoyama, who works at Nippon Steel's subsidiary in Wuhan, said more than 400 of his compatriots wishing to return to Japan were still in the city, including employees of a Japanese supermarket chain that had stayed open during the lockdown.\n\n\"I hope we can also provide support for the Chinese people, which I think would also help the Japanese people who are still there,\" he said.\n\nAnother evacuee, Takayuki Kato, said all of the passengers had had their temperatures taken before the plane left Wuhan and again by a doctor during the flight. \"Everyone in the city began wearing masks. On the 23rd, when transport was shut down, I became very alarmed,\" he said.\n\nAll of the passengers were expected to undergo further health checks, with those showing symptoms to be hospitalised and the remainder to undergo \"self-quarantine\" at home until they can be declared free of the virus.\n\nAround 650 Japanese nationals in the Wuhan area have said they want to return home. Reports said a second plane was due to leave Tokyo on Wednesday evening, with additional flights planned.\n\nThe first flight had arrived in the Chinese city on Tuesday night carrying emergency supplies, including 15,000 masks, 50,000 pairs of gloves and 8,000 protective glasses, the foreign ministry said.\n\nIn and around Wuhan, more than 50 million people have been locked down as authorities struggle to stop an infection that has since spread to more than 15 countries.\n\nOfficials in Germany said four people from the same company were infected after one of them contracted it from a colleague while visiting their workplace in China.\n\nLate on Tuesday, Japan reported its first possible case of human-to-human transition, with reports that a coach driver in his 60s had tested positive after twice driving groups of tourists from Wuhan earlier this month. The man is reportedly recovering.\n\nJapan's health ministry has so far confirmed seven cases of the virus in the country.\n\nOn Wednesday an Australian research facility announced it had the first team outside China to recreate the deadly virus in a lab, which will improve the speed and accuracy of testing and increase the chances of developing a vaccine.\n\n\"This is one step, a piece in the puzzle that we have contributed,\" said virus identification laboratory head Dr Julian Druce, from Melbourne's Peter Doherty Institute.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

Wuhan coronavirus crisis", "body": "'These days, many have died,' says bystander as image shows emergency workers in protective suits and masks taking body away\n\nIt is an image that captures the chilling reality of the coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan: a grey-haired man wearing a face mask lies dead on the pavement, a plastic shopping bag in one hand, as police and medical staff in full protective suits and masks prepare to take him away.\n\nOn what would typically be a crowded street in Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million people under quarantine, there are only a few passersby - but they dare not go near him.\n\nJournalists from Agence France-Presse saw the body on Thursday morning, not long before a vehicle arrived carrying emergency workers.\n\nThe man lay straight on his back in front of a closed furniture shop. Medical staff in blue overalls gently shrouded his body with a blue blanket. The ambulance left, and police stacked supermarket cardboard boxes to hide the scene.\n\nAFP could not determine how the man, who appeared to be aged in his 60s, had died. AFP contacted police and local health officials afterwards but could not get details on his case.\n\nBut the reaction of the police and medical staff in hazmat suits, as well as some of the bystanders, highlighted the fear pervading the city.\n\nA woman standing near the man said she believed he had died from the virus.\n\n\"It's terrible,\" she said. \"These days many people have died.\"\n\nWuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is believed to have been transmitted from wild animals to humans at a city market .\n\nThe virus, which emerged late last year, has claimed at least 213 lives and infected thousands in China, with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone.\n\nWith the virus spreading to other countries, the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency.\n\nAuthorities have imposed an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan, blocking off roads out of the city and banning flights, in a bid to stop the virus spreading. Countries including the UK, US, France, Japana and South Korea have evacuated citizens from the city.\n\nThose who are trapped are enduring a tormenting wait for the lockdown to end, for a cure to be found, or even just for check-ups at overwhelmed hospitals.\n\nThe dead man on the street on Thursday lay one block from the Wuhan Number Six Hospital, one of the main medical centres for treating those with virus symptoms.\n\nA team of forensic experts who examined him were immediately sprayed with disinfectant by colleagues after removing their hazardous material suits.\n\nIn the two hours that AFP observed the scene, at least 15 ambulances passed by, attending other calls.\n\nFinally, a white van with blacked-out windows arrived to take away the man. The body was zipped into a yellow surgical bag, and carried into the van on a stretcher.\n\nStaff immediately began to clean the ground as the van drove away, disinfecting the streets where the body had lain.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Asians | Sam Phan", "body": "Stereotypes are spreading as quickly as the virus. On the bus, in the street, people have started treating us as if we're infected\n\nThe atmosphere on my morning commute is tense. As panic over the coronavirus deepens and dominates the headlines, as an east Asian I can't help but feel more and more uncomfortable. On the bus to work last week, as I sat down, the man next to me immediately scrambled to gather his stuff and stood up to avoid sitting next to me.\n\nOn the train over the weekend, a group sat opposite me chattering about their weekend plans. One of them seriously advised the rest, \"I wouldn't go to Chinatown if I were you, they have that disease.\"\n\nAs I made my way towards Chinatown in London, an elderly woman and her friend on the escalators at Leicester Square underground station were casually talking about how dangerous the area now was, and she complained she was obliged to go there for a meeting. \"At least I'm old, I have nothing left to lose,\" she laughed.\n\nIn another loud conversation, I overheard a woman talking about how terrified she was that her friend, who had spent some time working with Chinese students, might have infected her with the virus.\n\nIn light of current events, we east Asians in the UK are on high alert, paying close attention to how people interact with us. It is not their concern about health that is problematic, but the stereotyping of all east Asians as a coronavirus risk. At times such as this, even a simple bus trip can feel like a hostile environment.\n\nA friend at a university library experienced something similar: as soon as they sat down at a desk, the person in front of them packed up their things to leave. We're noticing odd things like this that we never saw happen before.\n\nPerhaps it did not occur to some of these people, so happy to talk loudly in front of me, that I was also concerned about the virus - or that I, as a British citizen, was no more likely than them to be carrying the virus. They grouped all east Asian people together, without factoring in that perhaps we were British or, if not, we were from unaffected areas of China, or even came from other countries in the Chinese diaspora. We were all the same to them.\n\nThe virus that originated in Wuhan has spread to at least eight other countries including Thailand, Japan, Australia and the US, and it's \"highly likely\" it will reach the UK, according to Public Health England.\n\nAs it spreads, the virus has revealed more and more stereotyped judgments about Chinese people. I have also heard accounts from east Asians, even if they are not Chinese, who have recently been profiled while travelling at airports or on trains due to the ignorant perception that all east Asians are Chinese.\n\nGeorge Osborne, editor of the Evening Standard, proudly tweeted his newspaper's cartoon of a rat with a face mask to supposedly commemorate the lunar new year. Piers Morgan mocked the Chinese language on Good Morning Britain with a tired \"ching chang chong\" joke. East Asians have been accused of instigating the virus by having \"revolting\" eating habits. Most Asians know these stereotypes all too well.\n\nThese insulting depictions don't reflect the reality of being Chinese at all, and encourage the misguided perception of more than one billion people being a monolithic and singular group in which everyone speaks, acts and looks the same. In fact, there is a huge diversity.\n\nLanguage and culture vary massively within the region. Speakers of Hokkien would not be able to converse with people who speak Hakka. And despite Mandarin being the lingua franca, there are more than 200 dialects spoken across China. In fact in Wuhan itself, a beautiful and diverse city with more than 3,500 years of history, many of its population of 11.8 million speak a Wuhan dialect.\n\nElsewhere, natives of Aksu look completely different to the majority Han Chinese. And the food, too: dim sum from the south of China is vastly different from the tangy, spicy flavours of Sichuan.\n\nThis week, my ethnicity has made me feel like I was part of a threatening and diseased mass. To see me as someone who carries the virus just because of my race is, well, just racist.\n\nAs the lunar new year celebrations take place across the world, let's take a moment to think about the way in which east Asians are perceived and how important it is to see us in all our diversity, as individual human beings, and to challenge stereotypes. The coronavirus is a human tragedy, so let's not allow fear to breed hatred, intolerance and racism.\n\n* Sam Phan is an MA student at the University of Manchester", "source": {"uri":

Morrison should have sacked the Bridget McKenzie over her handling of the $100m sports rorts affair, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The latest survey of 1,080 respondents, taken in the wake of revelations that McKenzie used a sports grants program to favour groups in Coalition-held or targeted seats, also shows voter support galvanising for an independent federal anti-corruption body, with 80% backing the proposal. McKenzie's controversial sports grants program awarded $248,000 to a country club that has a state National party MP as a life member and former chairman, weeks after the pair visited the venue together. Sport Australia reportedly raised concerns about the controversial $100m sports grant program, warning that the Morrison government's administration was compromising its independence.\n\nAn 8,000-hectare blaze burning in the Namadgi national park, south of Canberra. The blaze was started by an Australian Defence Force helicopter carrying a landing light, the heat from which sparked the blaze in hot and dry conditions. Late on Tuesday afternoon, residents of Tharwa, a village of about 80 people, were told it was too late to leave. The fire was downgraded overnight but Canberra is expected to endure temperatures in the high-30s for the rest of the week and over 40C on the weekend. Meanwhile, Australian Research Council laureates have signed a letter saying Australia's current position as \"ground zero\" for both the impacts of climate change and policy uncertainty presents an opportunity for the country to emerge as a leader in responding to the climate crisis. The Productivity Commission's review of government services shows Australia has suffered a 10% decline in the number of volunteer firefighters over the past decade.\n\nDonald Trump has launched his \"ultimate deal\" for Middle East peace, saying his detailed 80-page plan would be a \"realistic two-state solution\" that had already been agreed to by Israel, where the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has just been formally indicted in court on corruption charges after he withdrew his request for parliamentary immunity from prosecution. \"Today Israel takes a big step towards peace,\" Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu at the White House. \"I was not elected to do small things or shy away from big problems.\" He said Netanyahu had already agreed to a map of how the region would look, with Jerusalem as Israel's \"undivided capital\" that gives Israel extra territory.\n\nAustralia\n\nA rare fluorescent pink slug has survived the bushfires that burnt through much of its alpine habitat.

Andrew Mercado writes: \"In 1965, American primetime TV went all colour; the UK did the same in 1969. But Australia couldn't afford a war in Vietnam and new technology at the same time, so despite leading the world in TV firsts like nudity and sexual taboos, none of it happened in colour until the mid-1970s. When colour came to Australian TVs, it came in a uniquely Australian way: ushered in by an outrageous comedy legend named Aunty Jack, whose catchphrase to 'little kiddies' everywhere was: 'If you don't behave, I'll jump through your set and rip yer bloody arms off!'\"\n\nTo address climate change, we must stop dividing people along the faultlines of class and culture, writes Emma Dawson: \"The shocking levels of smoke haze blanketing Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne have meant that city-dwellers cannot avert their gaze from the impact of these massive fire fronts, so devastatingly charged by the impact of climate change on our arid land mass. So is it too much to hope that when the fires are, at least temporarily, quelled and the smoke subsides, this sense of national unity might extend beyond the immediate crisis?\"\n\nListen\n\nOn today's Full Story: the problem with Silicon Valley lifestyle hacks.

economy is close to a turning point as the country prepares to formally leave the EU after almost half a century of membership, according to a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month.\n\nMore than three and a half years after voting to leave, the UK will formally depart on Friday with the economy close to stalling point following repeated cliff-edge deadlines and intense political uncertainty over the country's future trading relationships with the EU and other countries.\n\nIn the Guardian's final Brexit watch before the exit date, warning lights are flashing with zero growth forecast for the final three months of 2019 amid intense political uncertainty, rounding off the worst year for growth outside of a recession since the second world war. Speculation has been rising that the Bank of England will cut interest rates on Thursday to reboot growth on the eve of leaving the EU.\n\nHowever, there are also early shoots of recovery from a surge in business confidence since Boris Johnson's unexpected decisive election victory, which could tempt the Bank to leave borrowing costs on hold at Mark Carney's final rate-setting meeting in charge at Threadneedle Street. Carney will stand down in March to be replaced by Andrew Bailey.\n\nTo gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian has been monitoring eight economic indicators over the past three years, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100.\n\nCity economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before the data was released, and in six cases over the past month the outcome was better than expected, raising hopes that Britain can rebound from a period of lacklustre growth.\n\nAs the country prepares to embark on a period of intense trade negotiations with Brussels that will define the economic landscape for years to come, the gloomiest of forecasts made ahead of the Brexit vote have not come to pass. Joblessness is at the lowest level since the mid 1970s, while wage growth has accelerated to the highest levels in a decade.\n\nHowever, it comes after an initial shock to the economy caused by the pound falling to the lowest point in 31 years straight after the June 2016 Brexit vote, which drove up the cost of importing goods to Britain. Inflation surged, squeezing living standards to leave the average family at least \u00a31,500 worseoff than under a remain outcome, according to the Resolution Foundation.\n\nGrowth in the UK economy has gone from the fastest in the G7 to among the weakest, with business investment flatlining as companies put their investment plans on hold to await greater clarity over Brexit. Repeated cliff-edge Brexit deadlines triggered booms in stockpiling as firms feared disruption at the borders and higher costs of trade with the EU, distorting quarterly growth and leading to boom and bust in the economy.\n\nIn the past month, figures show consumers reined in their spending over the key Christmas shopping period, in a blow for struggling retailers, while the world economy faces fresh risks from the Chinese coronavirus outbreak. Financial markets have been rocked in the past week as fears spread over the impact on trade. Analysts fear there could be knock-on effects for UK firms, at a delicate moment after years of disruption to the UK and world economy from the US-China trade war.\n\nHowever, the bright spots on the dashboard from a resilient jobs market and rising business confidence suggest Britain could be reaching a turning point. According to the consultancy Capital Economics, annual growth is set to accelerate from 1% this year to 1.8% in 2021 as the country turns a corner.\n\nHowever, two former members of the Bank of England's rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) warned that the tight timescale for reaching a deal with the EU that Boris Johnson has imposed could derail the recovery.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, who is now a senior adviser to the consultancy Cambridge Econometrics, said: \"Even if economic growth does recover somewhat in the next couple of quarters, the progress of the UK economy is likely to remain sluggish in 2020.\"\n\nWith inflation significantly below the Bank's 2% target rate set by the government, David Blanchflower, another former member of the MPC, called on the Bank to cut rates to reboot the economy.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, he said: \"If CPI was above the target by a similar amount, at 2.7% the MPC would almost surely raise rates. But the target is meant to be symmetric. Doing nothing is worse than doing something and there may well be lots of bad data ahead. It is hard to see how a cut could possibly hurt. It is always best to get your retaliation in first.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_partington@theguardian.com",

arrived at Gatwick airport last week when a British couple physically recoiled as she entered a lift. \"The woman looked at me, quickly turned to her husband and told him 'they should wear their masks',\" she said. \"They assumed I didn't understand English, that I was 'fresh off the boat' and that I probably had coronavirus.\" Humiliated, Zhou - a scientist who was travelling from London to Slovenia - stood in uncomfortable silence.\n\n\"I do give people the benefit of doubt because they're scared, but why can't they give me the benefit of doubt? Fear is no reason to be racist. Statistically, as a British citizen who hasn't been to China in two years, I have the same risk level as a white person.\"\n\nCoronavirus has spread to at least 16 countries including Japan, Thailand, Australia, France, the US and the UK. Hostility and racism directed by some people towards east Asians seems to be spreading faster still.\n\nJess Kerntiff, who works in PR, said she was stunned when a friend sent her a viral Instagram post of Chinese \"bat soup\" that claims unhygienic Chinese culture is to blame for coronavirus. \"She kept asking me if I'd eaten it, what was the weirdest thing I'd eaten and so on. When I said, 'I don't know, crab or something', she kept asking me what weird things people eat in Malaysia, which is where my family are from.\"\n\nKerntiff said she couldn't quite articulate at the time why it was upsetting. \"It bothered me though, she's a really good friend and I explained to her after a couple of days and then she got it, but posts like that deliberately dehumanise Chinese people. I don't know if I'm being paranoid but there doesn't seem to be much sympathy for people who have lost their lives or are going through this trauma, the narrative is as if it's deserved. There is no compassion.\"\n\nLondon's Chinatown was uncharacteristically quiet last week, with businesses reporting a slump in trade. \"The restaurants are less busy than normal,\" confirmed one manager. \"You think, maybe it is the weather and people think it's too cold and rainy to come out. But maybe it's because people believe fake news and are scared from eating Asian food.\"\n\nOne British-Chinese woman, who didn't want to give her name, said she felt anxious travelling on public transport. \"People have openly moved away from me on the train. Fear for me is having half my family in quarantine in Wuhan - the hysterical fear that many in western countries have is quite insulting to me.\"\n\nThe woman was in daily contact with relatives in the Hubei province, who reported feeling well. \"My parents here are not as panicked as some of the people I've encountered on Twitter and in real life,\" she said. \"The virus is being weaponised as a way to be openly racist - the French media have already called it \"yellow peril\" - as if there isn't a bigger health threat from parents who won't vaccinate their kids.\"\n\nThe number of Chinese students at UK universities dwarves those from other countries; in the 2016-17 academic year, there were 95,090 Chinese undergraduates and postgraduates in Britain. By comparison, the second-biggest international cohort is made up of 17,580 students from the US.\n\nAt the Central Saint Martins campus, part of the University of the Arts London (UAL), the mood was muted. \"Our focus is to keep calm and carry on and avidly watch official guidance,\" said Julie Dark, associate director of communications. \"Panic is high but the risk is low, and we're supporting students who are worried.\"\n\nThe standup comedian Ken Cheng, who encounters racial abuse frequently online, said he was unsurprised at how the virus was exposing deeper prejudices. \"There's been a bit of tension\" travelling on public transport, he said, but he was more concerned by how normalised anti-Chinese sentiment is. \"Around Chinese people, there has always been a thing where people think they can say whatever they want in a way they don't about other races, so you see all this stuff at the moment about all Chinese culture and people being dirty and barbaric, as if that's fair game.\"\n\nCheng was circumspect about why this might be but wanted to point out that he was as anxious about the virus as the next person. \"Maybe it's because we have a more submissive culture, we're not very aggressive and don't get into fights. Maybe we're just stoic. At the moment, the risk [of catching the virus] seems very low. For a major outbreak, it doesn't seem too bad. It's not a disaster movie.\"\n\n*Some names have been changed", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nosheen_iqbal@theguardian.com",

misinformation", "body": "Fake news and conspiracy theories about the origin of the coronavirus have swiftly followed the outbreak around the world.\n\nThe quick spread of the virus from its origins in China's Hubei province, and the lack of early detail about where it comes from or how to treat it, has provided ample room for speculation. One week after the city of Wuhan was placed under effective lockdown, the tide of misinformation is so high that Twitter, Facebook, and Google are struggling to cope.\n\nOn Friday, after the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency, Facebook said it would \"remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organisations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them\".\n\nOn Thursday, Twitter announced it would \"adjust search prompt in key countries across the globe to feature authoritative health sources when you search for terms related to novel #coronavirus.\"\n\nHere are some of the examples of misinformation spreading around the world.\n\n1. People eating bats in Wuhan\n\nThe biggest piece of misinformation about the cause of the virus is the widely circulated video of a woman eating a bat. It has been spread by the Daily Mail, RT and far-right YouTuber Paul Joseph Watson among others.\n\nThe Chinese celebrity Wang Mengyun said she has received death threats since the video went viral this month.\n\nThe origins of the coronavirus are believed to have been from illegally sold wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan, and bats could potentially have been the source, but the video was not filmed in a Wuhan restaurant as some had claimed, but in Palau, Micronesia, for a travel video in 2016.\n\n2. It's a deliberate plot\n\nProponents of the QAnon conspiracy theory, such as Jordan Sather, have been spreading the idea that the outbreak of the coronavirus was timed to coincide with the start of Donald Trump's impeachment trial.\n\nSather claimed in a thread posted to his 100,000 followers that the disease was planned and manufactured. He pointed to a coronavirus patent granted to a firm with ties to the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. The firm, Pirbright, had to issue a statement correcting misinformation. The firm said it researches infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus that infects poultry and pigs - not humans.\n\n3. It's a bioweapon\n\nThe Washington Times claimed in a story that the coronavirus outbreak could be linked to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, quoting a former Israeli military intelligence officer who claimed a bioweapon was one possible option.\n\nOther conspiracy theories have suggested the virus was smuggled out of Canada into China.\n\nThe Washington Post, however, spoke to a number of experts who said based on the virus genome there is no indication it was engineered. The MIT professor Vipin Narang said in a tweet that there is no evidence it is a bioweapon, and if it were, it would be a bad one, because a good bioweapon should be more deadly but not as easily spread.\n\n4. 5G caused the spread of coronavirus\n\nThese days 5G is blamed for everything, from cancer to bushfires, so it is not surprising that conspiracy theories that 5G caused, or helped spread coronavirus have been shared into the anti-5G groups on Facebook.\n\nOne post debunked on Facebook claimed Wuhan was where 5G was first rolled out, and 5G \"wrecked immune systems and thereby boosted the virulency of the normal cold\".\n\nWuhan was one of a few places where 5G was rolled out in China in 2020, along with other parts of the world. There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans.\n\n5. Just take oregano oil, vitamin C or salt water\n\nProminent anti-vaxxers and natural medicine groups have been sharing posts suggesting oregano oil, vitamin C, and salt water are either good ways to prevent coronavirus or cure it. They will not.\n\n6. Just drink bleach\n\nOne of the more dangerous remedies again comes from prominent QAnon conspiracy followers, with Daily Beast reporting the pro-Trump conspiracy theorists have told people to buy their \"miracle mineral solution\" that is supposed to cure everything, including autism or HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has said the solution is \"a dangerous bleach\".\n\n7. Chinese Red Bull and fortune cookies are virus carriers\n\nThere have been various viral posts on social media all trying to appear to be an official health-related update about what people should do to try to prevent them from getting in contact with the coronavirus.\n\nOne of the most prominent spread in Australia, via childcare centres, is an apparent \"urgent notice\" from the \"Department of Diseasology Parramatta\".\n\nThis non-existent department warned of food that could be contaminated including wuxhang rice, fortune cookies, migoreng noodles, Yakult, and Chinese Red Bull.\n\nThe New South Wales health department was forced to issue a statement stating there was no such entity as the Department of Diseasology Parramatta. \"NSW Health would like to assure the community that the locations mentioned in this post pose no risk to visitors, and there have been no 'positive readings' at train stations.\"\n\n8. The no-go suburbs\n\nAnother warning spread on social media claims to come from Queensland Health and warns people to stay away from certain suburbs in Brisbane and any populated areas that have a certain proportion of Chinese residents.\n\nThe Brisbane MP Duncan Pegg tweeted that the warning was fake and designed to malign the community.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

has announced it is suspending direct flights to and from mainland China following bans in the US and Singapore that affect crew logistics.\n\nEarlier, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, called on the federal government to halt all flights to Australia from China as the death toll from coronavirus rises.\n\nOn Friday the Trump administration announced the US was suspending the entry of foreign nationals who had travelled to China in the last 14 days. It is also redirecting flights from China to a handful of airports.\n\nQantas says it will suspend its direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai from 9 February until 29 March. Flights to Hong Kong will not be affected.\n\n\"Qantas will suspend its two direct services to mainland China (Sydney-Beijing and Sydney-Shanghai) from 9 February until 29 March 2020,\" its statement said.\n\n\"This follows entry restrictions imposed by countries including Singapore and the United States, which impact the movement of crew who work across the Qantas International network.\"\n\nPalaszczuk told reporters in Brisbane on Saturday that she backed \"recommendations in relation to no more incoming flights until the virus is contained\".\n\n\"I don't often agree with Donald Trump, but I do agree with the US authorities on this occasion that I think we should take every measure possible to combat this virus,\" she added.\n\nA spokesman for the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said national security officials would hear from the chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, in Sydney on Saturday.\n\nChinese state media reports 259 people have now died from coronavirus and 11,791 cases have been recorded, while a fourth case has been confirmed in Victoria.\n\nThe Melbourne woman aged in her 20s became ill two days after returning from Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, last Saturday. Health authorities say she was not infectious en route and is recovering in isolation at home.\n\nOn Friday, Palaszczuk accused the federal government of withholding information her government needed to contact travellers who had arrived in Queensland from China.\n\nShe said officials had since begun handing over more data.\n\nA 44-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman from Hubei province who were confirmed to have the virus were recovering in a stable condition in Gold Coast University Hospital.\n\nSeven others in their travel group remained in quarantine.\n\nThe Chinese Women's football team, which was in quarantine in the Westin Brisbane hotel, have not shown symptoms of the virus.\n\nA Qantas passenger plane was poised on Saturday to evacuate Australians stranded at the epicentre of the

How Chinese politics affected coronavirus response", "body": "When Wuhan's mayor took to live national television to discuss the rapidly escalating outbreak of coronavirus in his city, he came primed for a rare - and very prolonged - display of self criticism.\n\nOver nearly an hour Zhou Xianwang said his work \"wasn't performed well enough\", that the city government had failed to provide timely information or act on what it knew, and offered his own resignation, although it is yet to be accepted.\n\nFor once, the official position matched the complaints of many people on the ground in Wuhan, who had been stewing for weeks about official failings they feared had turbo-charged the epidemic just when it should have been easiest to contain.\n\nHis city of 11 million people, famous inside China for everything from ancient poetry to a very political swim by Mao Zedong, was less well known abroad until 23 January, when plans were announced to seal it off in an unprecedented mass quarantine.\n\nChina soon won international plaudits for a huge mobilisation, including the near impossible feat of building two new hospitals in as many weeks, even as Wuhan became an international byword for a new epidemic.\n\nYet, as information about the early days of the outbreak has slowly filtered out of China, it has become increasingly clear that the same political system that allowed Beijing to order such a dramatic response, also initially allowed the virus to fester.\n\nThe country's authoritarian bureaucracy offers officials few incentives to be proactive, and many to attempt to hide emerging crises, said Prof Sam Crane, the chair of Asian studies at Williams College, Massachusetts.\n\n\"If we consider not only Sars in 2003 but also large-scale disasters like the Songhua River contamination in 2005 and the Wenzhou train crash in 2011, and we could add other incidents, we see a pattern of denial and cover-up and evasion on the part of local leaders,\" he said.\n\n\"[They are] afraid of being associated with 'problems' that could reflect badly on their personal careers and create headaches for higher level leaders.\"\n\nWhen the coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, its scale and lethality were uncertain. A high-profile public campaign on disease control risked highlighting failures that allowed a new disease to emerge at all, and denting the economy, while the threats from the disease itself were far more nebulous.\n\nSo during the crucial early days of the outbreak, local officials seemed at least as concerned about covering up the outbreak as they were about halting any spread.\n\nPeople who posted about the mystery new illness were arrested for \"spreading false news\"; patients who turned up at hospitals with typical symptoms and links to the wildlife market at the centre of the outbreak said they were not tested for the disease.\n\nBy 10 January, China had identified the new coronavirus, made its genome public and created testing kits. Yet between 3 and 16 January, authorities in Wuhan claimed there were no new cases, and no evidence of human-to-human transmission, key drivers of any new epidemic.\n\nThe systems that might provide a check on corrupt officials or efforts to bury bad news in other countries, from a free press to local charities and activists, do not do so in China.\n\nDuring his eight years in power President Xi Jinping has dramatically reduced the already narrow space for civil society.\n\nEven the \"back channels\" of information that are meant to keep the leadership properly informed about events nationwide, while official media churns out propaganda, have reportedly been drying up under Xi.\n\nCrane said: \"After the initial period of typical local level evasion and bungling, the response this time has been faster and more transparent than Sars in 2003. But that is probably due to better medical science infrastructure. Xi Jinping's governing style has done nothing, really, to change the systemic problems.\n\n\"Indeed, he might be making them worse, insofar as information is subject to political control and many local cadres now live in fear of being called out for corruption and thus more likely to hide problems.\"\n\nZhou, the Wuhan mayor, even made an apparent allusion to systemic problems, with a subtle but pointed dig at the central government. His hands were tied, he said, by laws that barred him from declaring an epidemic without permission.\n\nIt is not clear yet if efforts which seized headlines worldwide will be enough to halt the spread of a disease which has now infected more people in China over two months than Sars did over nine months.\n\n\"They will take these draconian measures not for health benefits but for the political benefits of seeming to be in control,\" said Jorge Guajardo, who served as Mexico's ambassador to Beijing during the 2009 outbreak of H1N1, or swine flu.\n\nReports from Wuhan of shortages of basic equipment, such as masks and gowns, are a reminder that government logistics are far from infallible. Details are still unclear as to exactly where the disease originated, when the first cases emerged and when the numbers of those infected will stop growing exponentially.\n\nWhen the crisis ends there may be a leadership shakeup in Wuhan, in Hubei province and perhaps among health officials beyond that.\n\nThe first head has already rolled, with the health chief of Huanggang city being removed from her post after a TV interview, in which she struggled to answer basic questions about the virus response, went viral.\n\nBut any changes will be to protect the system and the central leadership in response to fallout from the crisis, not to shake it up.\n\nXi, who has built up something of a personality cult, appears to have taken a finely balanced public approach. State media has shown him in control but not the sole political face of a government campaign whose results are still uncertain.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

trade talks for 40 years'\n\nHello, it's Friday morning - a sombre morning for those unhappy to see the UK officially leaving the European Union at 11 o'clock tonight. Warren Murray here with your guide to this, that and the other news of the day.\n\nAs we enter the last hours before the split from the EU, is Britain effectively declaring open season on itself? Donald Trump is poised to demand the NHS pay higher prices for US drugs in a free-trade deal with the UK, warns Kim Darroch, the esteemed peer and ex-diplomat. Britain's outgoing ambassador to Washington - who had to resign after dispatches critical of the Trump administration were leaked - has predicted to the Guardian that the president will reward backers in drug firms and agriculture by forcing trade concessions from No 10. The UK, he argues, will struggle to come out a winner when \"we have not done trade negotiations for 40 years\". \"People talk about chlorinated chicken - it is a lot more than that,\" Darroch said. \"He believes in America first. And he believes, particularly, in rewarding people who vote for him and that is American farmers and big American corporations.\"\n\nThere will be no \"Big Ben bongs\", no church bells and no fireworks - they are illegal after 11pm - to mark the moment of Britain's departure. The government says a countdown will be projected on to Downing Street buildings, though. When the moment of severance arrives, Boris Johnson will launch into a speech about the future of the UK. Demonstrators against Brexit will meet at Southbank in London with torches to \"shine a light through the darkness\", with similar gatherings due to take place in Brighton and Bournemouth. Leave Means Leave will hold a rally. Sajid Javid will hand over one of the first of the 50p Brexit coins to the PM.\n\nDuring 47 years of membership, the UK's permanent representatives to the EU have been at the coalface of British diplomacy and negotiation in Europe. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian, the surviving nine \"perm reps\" - past and present - reflect on Britain's European story.\n\nBritons fly out of Wuhan - Among updates we are bringing you in our coronavirus live blog this morning: a flight carrying 83 UK citizens has taken off from Wuhan, the epicentre of the emergency, bound for Britain. The US government has warned Americans not to travel to China, where the death toll has reached at least 213. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency. An increasing number of airlines have stopped flying to mainland China, including Air France KLM SA, British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, while others have reduced flights. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has said all air traffic between Italy and China will stop. His country has, meanwhile, experienced a spate of anti-Chinese incidents. Conspiracy theories and dangerous preventative \"advice\" have been circulating on the internet - we have rounded some of it up for debunking.\n\nTrump on brink of acquittal - Donald Trump may be acquitted as early as today in his Senate impeachment trial. Key Republican swing votes that could have allowed witnesses to be called appeared to be falling away in overnight proceedings. Democrats have decried the situation as paving the way for a \"lawless presidency\" unable to be reined in by checks and balances. The Democrats have pushed for the president's former national security adviser John Bolton to testify with what could be a damaging account of Trump's \"quid pro quo\" strategy with Ukraine.\n\nLung cancer found too late - People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&E because their GP missed signs of the disease, often despite repeated visits, according to findings by experts. The proportion diagnosed in A&E - as many as 56% of people in some parts of England - are five times more likely to die within a year. Patients' reluctance to have symptoms such as a persistent cough checked out can also delay diagnosis, especially among older people and those from poorer households. Prof Mick Peake, of the UK's Lung Cancer Coalition, said: \"We strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.\"\n\nWarning of oil crash risk - The oil industry could face a global market shock if governments delay tackling the climate crisis, according to the thinktank Carbon Tracker. Its analysis warns that the longer governments wait, the tougher limits on the use of fossil fuels will need to be. Carbon Tracker says such a sudden \"handbrake turn\" could have a \"forceful, abrupt and disorderly\" impact on the global industry, wiping out billions of dollars worth of investments. The thinktank warned investors against oil market scenarios published by the International Energy Agency which predict a steady decline in demand rather than a sudden collapse. Existing forecasts are for oil demand to grow 0.6% a year over the next five years, but Carbon Tracker found a crackdown on emissions could shrink demand by 2.6% a year from 2025 onwards. Europe's most vulnerable oil company is BP, according to the report, followed by Norway's Equinor, Paris-headquartered Total, Italy's Eni and Anglo-Dutch Shell.\n\nSex and the CofE - The archbishops of Canterbury and York have apologised over a statement issued by Church of England bishops that declared only married heterosexuals should have sex. Justin Welby and John Sentamu said they took responsibility for releasing the statement: \"We are very sorry and recognise the division and hurt this has caused.\" They did not retract the substance of the \"pastoral guidance\" but implied it should not have been issued while the CofE is in the midst of a review of its teaching on sexuality and marriage. The guidance said \"sexual relationships outside heterosexual marriage are regarded as falling short of God's purpose for human beings\", and that people in gay or straight civil partnerships should be sexually abstinent.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: The Brexit gamble\n\nAnushka Asthana looks back on an extraordinary period of chaos in politics since David Cameron called the EU referendum. Plus: on the day the UK leaves, Faiza Shaheen argues that remainers must now put their energy into ideas to take Britain forward.\n\nLunchtime read: 'The young are in despair'\n\nAfter an indifferent sojourn in Hollywood, the film-maker Bong Joon-ho went back to South Korea to do his next film - and, in Parasite, produced an undisputed masterpiece. Why is his stunning critique of the class system striking chords all over the world?\n\nSport\n\nEngland have been handed a major blow before the start of their Six Nations campaign after Anthony Watson was ruled out of Sunday's match against France, with Eddie Jones leaning towards handing a debut to George Furbank in his place. More than 150 football-related racist incidents were reported to police last season, Home Office figures show, a rise of more than 50% on the year before and more than double the number from three seasons ago.\n\nUSA Gymnastics has filed a bankruptcy plan that includes an offer of $215m for sexual abuse survivors to settle their claims against the embattled organisation. Wigan won the opening game of the new Super League season 16-10 against Warrington, who had their captain, Chris Hill, sent off in the first half. Saqib Mahmood is looking to hit the 90mph mark during the coming white-ball fixtures in South Africa after feeling the benefit of Darren Gough's short spell as an England coach. And Arsenal captain Kim Little has joined Fifpro's new players' council as she tries to give back to the game and influence what happens next.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe collapse of Norton motorcycles was sad news for the manufacturing sector this week. But our reporter Simon Goodley reveals the full story behind the administration, involving hundreds of hapless pension holders, together with unsuspecting Norton customers, staff and even government ministers, who ploughed in millions of pounds in taxpayer support. Asian stocks have recovered some ground today after the WHO stepped back from supporting restrictions on trade with China due to the coronavirus outbreak. The FTSE100 is poised to rise 0.7% while the pound is on $1.31 and \u20ac1.187.\n\nThe papers\n\nYou can see all the front pages here today - herewith a summary. The Guardian illustrates Britain's EU departure with the white cliffs of Dover, a union jack planted in a sandcastle in the foreground and the headline \"Small island\". The Mail has the same backdrop but its headline is \"A new dawn for Britain\", while the i calls it \"UK's leap into the unknown\".\n\n\"Our time has come\" declares the Sun over a photo of Big Ben with the hands sitting on 11pm. \"Yes we did\" says the Express, which appears to attribute Brexit to itself and its readers. The Times goes with: \"PM wants Canada-style trade deal with Brussels\".\n\nThe Telegraph front page pictures and paraphrases Johnson: \"This is not an end, but a beginning\", while the FT has perhaps the most straightforward take: \"Britain bows out of the EU with a mixture of optimism and regret\".\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

Asia-focused lender Standard Chartered is also restricting travel to China and Hong Kong and has asked staff either returning from China or who have family members who have visited the country to work from home for 14 days after their return.\n\nChinese video games giant Tencent and online retail giant Alibaba have asked their staff to stay at home until 10 February, while Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs has told staff who have visited mainland China to work from home for the next fortnight.\n\nFrench automotive group PSA, which makes the Peugeot and Citroen car brands, said it is assisting with repatriation of all non-Chinese staff and their families from its sites in the Wuhan area.\n\nThe action from companies worried about the impact of the virus comes as travel is being restricted within the region and between China and the world. The high-speed rail link between Hong Kong and mainland China will be suspended from 30 January.\n\nThe virus has spooked stock markets over the past week amid the growing threat to the global economy. Airlines, hotel groups and luxury goods firms have been among the worst hit. Burberry's share price has lost 14% over the past 10 days, while IAG, the owner of British Airways, is down 12%. Holiday Inn group Intercontinental Hotels has lost 10%.\n\nThe price of copper - regarded as a bellwether of the health of the global economy - fell for the 10th consecutive day. The oil price is also under pressure, with Brent Crude changing hands at less than $59 a barrel at one point. China's demand for oil has been growing at 5.5% a year.\n\nThe Japanese economy minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, warned on Tuesday that factory production and company profits could take a hit from the virus. China is Japan's second-biggest export market and 40% of tourist spending in the country comes from Chinese visitors. Carmaker Honda has three plants in Wuhan.\n\nNishimura said if the virus was not contained \"we're concerned it could hurt Japanese exports, output and corporate profits.\"\n\nSome economists are forecasting a possible slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Economics, said China's real GDP could fall in the first three months of this year , depending on how long it takes to contain the outbreak.\n\nBeamish said lost factory production could be made up, but missed holiday spending would simply be lost.\n\nOfficial Chinese data two weeks ago showed the slowest economic growth in 29 years.", "source":

coronavirus crisis, Kyrgios defeat", "body": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 28 January.\n\nTop stories\n\nPrince Andrew is not cooperating in the Jeffrey Epstein inquiry, say US prosecutors. Federal prosecutors and the FBI have asked to interview Prince Andrew about the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein but he has not responded, said Geoffrey Berman, US attorney for the southern district of New York. Berman spoke outside the mansion in Manhattan formerly owned by Epstein, who died in custody in New York in August. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe North Brisbane football club received $150,000 through the controversial federal sports grants program despite already having won $138,000 from the Queensland government and a $110,000 grant from the Brisbane city council for the same field surface upgrade. The Morrison government claims the federal money \"complemented\" the state grant, but the club was forced to go back to the council for permission to use the local government money to instead build women's changerooms, after winning funding multiple times for the same project.\n\nReligious groups are fighting a move to make gay conversion therapy a crime in Queensland. In late November, the Queensland government introduced legislation that would, among other amendments to health legislation, make the practice of conversion therapy to change or suppress a person's sexual orientation or gender identity punishable by up to 18 months in jail. The examples provided in the legislation include aversion therapy, psychoanalysis or hypnotherapy with the aim of changing or suppressing a person's sexuality, but it also extends to counselling and group activities.\n\nAustralia\n\nThe Australian government does not know how many of its citizens are caught in the coronavirus quarantine across China, as it and governments around the world scramble to try to evacuate their nationals. In Sydney, several private schools have banned students who have recently visited China from returning to school without medical certificates, as concerns grow about the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe federal government is withholding millions of dollars from the New South Wales government for failing to complete water resource plans for the Murray-Darling Basin.\n\nKen Wyatt has called for legal changes to protect Aboriginal artists from carpetbaggers. Federal and state ministers, police and Aboriginal art industry representatives will meet in central Australia next month to discuss ways to stamp out the unethical treatment and exploitation of Aboriginal artists.\n\nThe Australian government is releasing highly sensitive medical records to police through a secret regime that experts say contains fundamentally flawed privacy protections.\n\nThe world\n\nThe mayor of Wuhan has acknowledged criticism over his handling of the coronavirus crisis. A virtual lockdown has been imposed on Wuhan since Thursday, when trains and flights were cancelled, public transport suspended and, later, most private cars banned from the roads. There is anger among residents that the public were not informed earlier about the potential risks posed by the outbreak, which is thought to have begun in December, or told about what precautions to take. Also on Monday, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organisation, held a special meeting with officials in Beijing to discuss how to contain the outbreak.\n\nMore than 200 survivors have gathered at the former Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz, many probably for the final time, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of its liberation.\n\nTrump's standing against Democratic candidates has improved, according to a new poll. The result comes amid signs that more voters are in general less worried about the economy and their own economic wellbeing, and a week out from the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe US National Security Agency is facing questions about the security of top government officials' communications following last week's allegations that the Saudi crown prince may have had a hand in the alleged hack of Jeff Bezos.\n\nPeople remain in shock over the death of Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna in a helicopter crash on Sunday. Seven others died in the crash, including a well-known California college baseball coach, John Altobelli, and his wife and daughter, Keri and Alyssa.\n\nRecommended reads\n\nOn paper, Josh Thomas's Please Like Me didn't exactly scream \"LOL\". A half-hour comedy about mental illness (anxiety, depression, bipolar), the first episode of which opened with the main character coming out as gay and the suicide attempt of his mum? Not quite your classic Australian TV comedy, writes Benjamin Law. Although it was thoroughly Australian, Please Like Me became part of a wave of spiritually aligned international TV comedies in which you got the palpable sense writers had scripted episodes with as much emotional rigour as any prestige drama.\n\nWe're working, but not as much as we want to - and that keeps wages low, writes Greg Jericho. \"We began 2019 with the unemployment rate at 5.0% and we left it with the rate at 5.1%. This in itself suggests not much happened, but if we look at the chart of the unemployment rates for men and women, we see that last year was one where these two genders had very different outcomes. Both men and women also had 5.0% unemployment in December 2018, but while women's unemployment rate remains at that level (and with a rate of 4.96% close to being rounded down to 4.9%), the rate for men has risen to 5.3%.\"\n\nListen\n\nOn the latest episode of Today in Focus: Life after Auschwitz. Ivor Perl and Susan Pollack were 12 and 13 when they were transported to Auschwitz. On the 75th anniversary of the concentration camp's liberation, they tell their stories.\n\nSport\n\nNick Kyrgios departed the Australian Open with a fourth-round defeat at the hands of world No1 Rafael Nadal, who took the match 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4) at the Rod Laver Arena, writes Russell Jackson. \"Containing some of the most thrilling tennis of the tournament, the three-and-a-half-hour tussle reached fever pitch in an electric third set, which Nadal won in a tiebreak, then chiselled his way to victory. Resilient in defeat, Kyrgios lost no fans.\"\n\nJohn McEnroe has meanwhile has slammed Margaret Court as the \"crazy aunt\" of tennis. \"There's only one thing longer than the list of Margaret Court's tennis achievements: it's her list of offensive and homophobic statements,\" he said on Eurosport.\n\nIn cricket, England have thrashed South Africa to claim 3-1 series win. England won by 191 runs as their hosts collapsed at the Wanderers.\n\nMedia roundup\n\nThe Australian reveals that Bridget McKenzie \"signed off on about $1m in grants for shooting clubs before her \u00addepartment received the results of a $160,000 report into the economic and social benefits of shooting\". The Sydney Morning Herald leads with the news that coronavirus could cost the Australian economy $2.3bn because of Chinese tourists and students staying home. A fortnight before Christmas \"the Morrison government sought advice from one of Australia's foremost marketing experts on how to better sell its policies, including those on climate change\", the Australian Financial Review reports.\n\nComing up\n\nWomen's world No 1 Ash Barty plays Petra Kvitova for a place in the semi-finals of the Australian Open.\n\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, will visit Orange in NSW for the first meeting of the drought and flood advisory board.\n\nAnd if you've read this far ...\n\nIt is a debate that has torn Britain in two, ripped friends and family apart, and entrenched deep and uncrossable lines throughout the land. Should the Royal Mint have used an Oxford comma on its Brexit 50p piece? His Dark Materials novelist Philip Pullman thinks so.\n\nSign up\n\nIf you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here.", "source":

cancelled over coronavirus crisis", "body": "Tokyo Olympic organisers have been forced to confront rumours the coronavirus outbreak could lead to the cancellation of the Games, less than six months before they are due to open.\n\nThe rising death toll in China from the virus, which has infected 17 people in Japan - including cases of human-to-human transmission - sparked claims online that the Olympics, which will be held from 24 July to 9 August, would be cancelled.\n\nFalse rumours that the 2020 Games would fall victim to the virus gained traction on social media after Deutsche Presse-Agentur, a German news outlet, ran a story about discussions between the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) that concluded that the outbreak \"may have a significant impact on the Games\".\n\nThe story, which was picked up by the Japanese-language Buzzap! portal site, generated at least 50,000 tweets under the hashtag \"Tokyo Olympics Cancelled\".\n\nIn response, Tokyo Olympic organisers insisted they were \"not considering\" cancelling the Olympics and Paralympics. \"We will work closely with the IOC and other concerned bodies to draw any countermeasures whenever necessary,\" they said.\n\nThe IOC said it had been in contact with the WHO about the coronavirus, which has spread to more than 20 countries, prompting travel restrictions and the suspension of China services by several airlines.\n\n\"Countermeasures against infectious diseases constitute an important part of Tokyo 2020's plans to host a safe and secure Games,\" the IOC said in a statement. \"Tokyo 2020 will continue to collaborate with all relevant organisations which carefully monitor any incidence of infectious diseases and will review any countermeasures.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Tokyo's governor, Yuriko Koike, suggested that failure to contain the outbreak could affect the Games.\n\n\"With only 177 days to go and our preparations accelerating, we must firmly tackle the new coronavirus to contain it, or we are going to regret it,\" she said on Wednesday during a meeting with municipal leaders. \"I will do the utmost to contain this new problem as we cooperate closely with all of you.\"\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak, which has killed 259 people - all in China - has already disrupted Olympic qualifying tournaments that were due to take place in the country this month.\n\nThe women's football has been relocated to Australia and women's basketball to Serbia, while boxing qualifiers for the Asia-Oceania region, which had been due to take place in Wuhan, have been moved to Jordan.\n\nThe world indoor track and field championships, which were to have been held in Nanjing in mid-March, were postponed for a year.\n\nAbout 11,000 athletes - including a large contingent from China - are expected to compete in Tokyo. Demand for the 7.8m tickets is high, with applications exceeding supply by at least 10 times. Around 4.5m tickets have been distributed domestically via a lottery.\n\nSeveral athletes skipped the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016, citing fears over the Zika virus, which is transmitted through mosquito bites. However, there were no confirmed cases of Zika connected to the Rio Games.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The
