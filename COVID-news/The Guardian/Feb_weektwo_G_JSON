Morrison is caught between a slogan and a hard place | Peter Lewis", "body": "The PM needs to admit he was wrong to cry 'surplus' and give the nation funds to get through the virus and bushfire crises\n\nHaving failed his first big leadership test over summer, events are conspiring to give the prime minister the opportunity to reload and prove his ability to lead the nation through an emerging and ongoing crisis.\n\nThe scope of the coronavirus is not yet clear, but governments across the globe have swung into decisive action to identify, manage and mitigate the risk of a global outbreak with a sense of urgency.\n\nOur elected leaders are taking advice from health experts, deploying their resources to protect the national interest, prepared to take short-term economic hits for the long-term national interest while keeping the public informed with a due degree of candour.\n\nThose yearning for globally coordinated climate action may look on and say \"if only\", but in the presence of a clear and present public danger our institutions are working in a way that has the potential to rebuild failing public trust.\n\nThe changing dynamics are reflected in this week's Essential Report, which shows the PM has stemmed the tide from his aestas horribilis, flattening out on approvals and restoring balance as preferred prime minister.\n\nIt's not that people have forgiven #ScottyFromMarketting for his past derelictions, but there is genuine concern across partisan and demographic lines about the virus and its impact to spread that is beyond the political day to day.\n\nA separate question shows general satisfaction with the government's handling of the virus to date, but when the specific measures being undertaken are outlined - and depoliticised - the support for those actions significantly increases.\n\nTo the extent that the government is shutting down the nation's borders, the public is right on board.\n\nThe use of Christmas Island may chafe those who have been disturbed by the politicisation of border security in the past, but when it comes to a potential pandemic, we want our government to use the resources at their disposal. Pushback to these measures is negligible.\n\nEmbedded in these findings is a yearning, in a time of global uncertainty, for government to protect us from a dangerous \"other\", which I suspect speaks to something even more ingrained in our national psyche.\n\nBy delaying the start of university terms, closing down tourism with China, even to the point of drawing the ire of one of our major trading partners, the government is putting community safety ahead of short-term economic interest. And we are grateful.\n\nIn the worst case that the virus is not contained and continues to spread, there will be further decisions for the government to make that Scott Morrison will be judged on. But these results show that, for the moment, he has seized the initiative in a time of crisis.\n\nIndeed, the real test of leadership will come in leading the economy through what could become a challenging year. Australia has relied on China trade - both resources and human - to soften the impact of global economic tides for more than a decade. Without that fillip we are exposed.\n\nThis is where Morrison will be confronted by another skeleton in the closet: his disingenuous and premature decision to proclaim the federal budget \"back in the black\" before the last federal election.\n\nWith the trade impact of coronavirus and the costs of the summer bushfires each placing stress on this projected surplus the PM and his treasurer will need to make a call: preserving its motif of economic competence or providing the funds to help rebuild the communities that were destroyed over summer.\n\nThe public is pretty clear, again across partisan lines. Caught between a slogan and a hard place, Morrison needs to take a political hit in the national interest, admit he was wrong to cry \"surplus\" and give the nation the funds it needs to get through these twin crises.\n\nJunking the budget will carry short-term political pain but preserving it could be even worse: whenever a dollar is short for a victim of the bushfires, attention will turn to the vanity surplus, or worse the boondoggling of marginal seats with sports grants.\n\nWe know the PM can develop a sharp message and deliver a line; indeed he has shaped an entire political agenda to play to these strengths. Now the times are testing whether he has what it takes to be anything more than the #ScottyFromMarketting.\n\n* Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic

for coronavirus crisis", "body": "Ben Woodward has seen some difficult times in the tourism industry, but the Cairns operator says the coronavirus outbreak threatens to beat the lot.\n\n\"As an industry, we've come through crisis situations before, there's been Sars, there's been the GFC, there's been the pilot strike, but it is looking like one of the worst crisis situations we've encountered as an industry.\"\n\nCairns and Port Trips and Attractions has more than 200 staff across its bus tours, nature parks and sanctuaries in far north Queensland. Woodward, the company's sales and marketing director, says cancellations started rolling in as soon as the Australian government imposed its ban on non-Australian citizens arriving from China, following China's own cancellation of international tour groups leaving the country.\n\n\"And they kept coming through to the point where the following couple of weeks are supposed to be the busiest weeks for Chinese new year, and it's just completely dropped off,\" he says. \"Anywhere from 40% to 60% down [on last year].\"\n\nRatings agency S&P has said it will deliver a big but temporary blow to China's economy that will spill over to the whole world, while the Reserve Bank of Australia chief, Philip Lowe, has warned the coronavirus will do more harm to Australia's economy than the 2003 Sars outbreak.\n\nThe tourism industry is expected to be among the worst hit.\n\nThe Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, told state parliament last week the Cairns region alone had already lost $200m in bookings, and Gold Coast operators were expecting to lose $400m.\n\nThe chief executive of Destination Gold Coast, Annaliese Battista, says China is the Gold Coast's largest international market, and injects about half a billion dollars into the economy, with a peak around lunar new year.\n\nShe says the bushfires had already led to a softening in the market, and once China banned group bookings, individuals also started to cancel.\n\n\"Our large accommodation service providers, and we have 34,000 rooms on the Gold Coast, coming back off a bumper 2019, we are seeing about a 15-20% cancellations across our accommodation sector, and obviously Chinese businesses with a high level of exposure ... are feeling the pinch,\" she says.\n\n\"Some of them are telling me there's about a 50% drop off in bookings, and the irony is there's a bit of a reflexive panic, fear type thing among other international markets.\"\n\nBattista says it will be the small mum and dad businesses that will suffer the most.\n\n\"Of the 3,500 tourism operators we have on the Gold Coast, the vast majority are those small to medium size operators.\"\n\nWoodward says there has also been a flow-on effect to tourists from other Asian nations such as South Korea and Japan, and other parts of the world.\n\n\"We are also starting to see cancellations from western groups as well, so groups from the UK and North America cancelling bookings directly because of coronavirus,\" he says.\n\nOperators hope a domestic marketing campaign can make up the shortfall, but they have also called on the Queensland government to immediately suspend state fees and charges until the coronavirus crisis is over. The state government in turn wants the federal government to extend disaster relief payments to businesses badly hit by the outbreak.\n\nThe latter will need to be approved by all states and territories, which are not due to meet on the matter until April.\n\nIt is not just Queensland feeling the pinch. Terry Smit, the managing director of Bunyip tours in Victoria, says he has seen a number of cancellations from agents focused on the Chinese market.\n\n\"I wish I could forecast the future, but for right now we're shortening some of our casual shifts, and our reservation staff are being told to come in later or go home earlier if there's not much to do.\"\n\nThe long-term impact, he says, would be casual staff looking for other jobs, meaning fewer experienced tour guides.\n\n\"You can't just turn the tap on when you need more tour guides or reservation staff. It takes time. And good tour guides don't grow on trees.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_taylor@theguardian.com", "name": "Josh

mission", "body": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 11 February.\n\nTop stories\n\nA Liberal National party donor received a $5.5m jobs and investment grant despite potentially being ineligible because it is a registered training organisation. In April 2018 Nolan Meats was approved to receive the grant under the $200m regional jobs and investment package's business stream, despite being listed as a registered training organisation, a disqualification under the program guidelines. According to a scathing auditor general report, released in November, the program received 12 applications that were ineligible for funding, including one that was successful.\n\nA day ahead of the New Hampshire primary, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders remain on a collision course. The two candidates represent disparate wings of the Democratic party and are increasingly contesting frontrunner status in the contest for the nomination to face Donald Trump in November's presidential election. On Sunday, a Boston Globe/WBZ/Suffolk University poll found Sanders leading in New Hampshire with 26% support, followed by Buttigieg with 19% and the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar in third with 13%. It was the latest in a string of surveys showing Sanders or Buttigieg leading the rest of the field. Bright spots have meanwhile been few and far between for Joe Biden of late. After the catastrophic performance in Iowa, where he finished a distant fourth, Biden is polling fifth in New Hampshire, too, unthinkable for someone who spent most of 2019 in the lead.\n\nFormer resources minister Matt Canavan delayed releasing documents about his interactions with coal lobbyists until he resigned his post, rendering a freedom of information request void. In November, the Australian Conservation Foundation sought access to all records of Canavan's interactions with New Hope Coal and its lobbyists in the weeks leading up to the announcement of a crackdown on the use of secondary boycotts by environmental activists. The minister identified six relevant documents but asked for more time to consult third parties. Last week, following Canavan's resignation as minister, ACF campaigner Christian Slattery was told the request was now void because Canavan no longer held the office and the documents had not been kept by his successor.\n\nAustralia\n\nDrones are being used to save koalas injured in the bushfires. Victorian forest and wildlife officers, with the help of the Australian defence force, are using drone and infrared technology in a search and rescue operation for koalas affected by recent bushfires in Victoria.\n\nHeavy rain in parts of regional NSW may have relieved immediate water security issues in as many as 20 towns, said the state's public servant charged with keeping the taps running in drought-hit regions.\n\nScott Morrison remains in the political doldrums, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The Prime minister's approval sits on 39%, and more than half the sample, 52%, disapprove of his performance.\n\nCelebrity chef George Calombaris has put much of his restaurant empire into voluntary administration. About 400 employees are set to lose their jobs. The only part of the business excluded from the appointment is a chain of four Yo-Chi outlets.\n\nThe world\n\nSinn F\u00e9in has declared victory in Ireland's general election and called for talks with other main parties to form a coalition government. Its leader, Mary Lou McDonald, urged Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il to start negotiations with the republican party as the scale of its breakthrough confirmed a realignment of Irish politics.\n\nAnother 66 passengers onboard a luxury cruise liner quarantined in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the number of infected people on the ship to 136. China's president, Xi Jinping, has made his first public appearance in weeks, as some people began to return to work following the extended lunar new year holiday.\n\nThe Trump administration has submitted its 2021 budget proposal to Congress, a $4.8tn plan which has no chance of passing into law.\n\nMassive swarms of locusts sweeping across much of east Africa have reached Uganda and Tanzania, the United Nations has said, threatening millions more people with hunger in an already fragile region.\n\nThe US military is preparing to report a more than 50% jump in the number of cases of traumatic brain injury stemming from Iran's missile attack on a base in Iraq last month.\n\nGirls are beginning puberty almost a year earlier than women 40 years ago, according to research.\n\nRecommended reads\n\nHadley Freeman's night at the Oscars was tacky and endearing. \"There must be a word - maybe in German, or possibly in Korean - for that piquant feeling of being at one of the most exclusive events in the world, surrounded by people who have only ever turned left on a plane, but are now cheering on a movie about the corrosive effects of class barriers. Don't get me wrong: it was genuinely delightful to be there on Sunday night, watching Parasite bulldoze its way through the awards. And goodness, how the audience was on Parasite's side, with the cheers becoming so much more pronounced for it than any of its other fellow nominees that it felt almost awkward by the end.\"\n\nIt's time for government spending, writes Greg Jericho, with household wallets closed tight even before the hit from bushfires and the coronavirus. \"People will likely remain hesitant about what the future holds. With the Reserve Bank continuing to predict that wages growth will remain low and that the economy is currently having a bit of a stumble, unless the government sees fit to come to the rescue and determine a strong boost in spending is required to get some life into the economy, that hesitancy is likely to continue for another year.\"\n\nListen\n\nOn Today in Focus: does the British Labour party have room for Blairism and Corbynism? Peter Mandelson and Steve Howell represent the two opposite poles of the Labour party: one was a key architect of Blairism, the other of Corbynism. But they started out as inseparable friends at the same school in north London. Now their focus is on what comes next for the party. Plus: Matthew Taylor on the growing prevalence of climate anxiety.\n\nCook\n\nA simple batter can be tweaked for savoury or sweet applications, used pan-fried, deep fried or baked, writes Jackie Middleton. \"I like recipes that are predictable, solid and dependable, and this basic savoury batter is all three. I use the batter, spiced slightly, for these pan-fried sweetcorn and zucchini fritters. I've also deep-fried this mixture and baked it in little muffin moulds to create canap\u00e9s too.\"\n\nSport\n\nSouth African teams are eclipsing Australia's Super Rugby efforts, writes Bret Harris. Form so far this season indicates a competitive Springboks team could be assembled by just selecting players from domestic franchises.\n\nA former NFL player has won the Oscar for best animated short film eight years after predicting he would one day be nominated. Matthew A Cherry wrote and directed Hair Love and won the award along with producer Karen Rupert Toliver.\n\nMedia roundup\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald and the Age lead with the budget surplus, using the words \"wipeout\" and \"up in smoke\" respectively, to describe its fate. The Australian reports that a second person \"has been isolated in quarantine on Christmas Island pending the result of a coronavirus test.\" The Australian Financial Review takes a look at some of the Australian companies impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nComing up\n\nThe high court will decide on whether the Australian government can deport two Aboriginal \"aliens\" Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms.\n\nSign up\n\nIf you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

"Friday's top story: the attorney general insists he will not be 'bullied' by Trump. Plus, the trouble with anti-populism\n\nGood morning, I'm Tim Walker with today's essential stories.\n\nBarr says Trump's tweets make his job 'impossible'\n\nWith his Department of Justice under fire from the White House, the US attorney general, William Barr, told ABC on Thursday that Donald Trump's tweets about criminal cases - including that of Trump's associate Roger Stone - \"make it impossible for me to do my job\", but insisted he would not be \"bullied\". Matthew Miller, an Obama-era DoJ official, expressed skepticism, tweeting: \"Barr is telling the president that his impulsiveness is making it politically harder for him to deliver the results he wants.\"\n\nJohn Kelly. Trump's former White House chief of staff has criticised the president for his firing of Alexander Vindman, the US army officer who testified in the impeachment case. Kelly took issue with several other Trump policies in a speech at Drew University.\n\nHope Hicks. Trump's long-serving aide, who left the White House in 2018 to work at Fox News, is returning to the president's side as a White House counselor.\n\nDemocrats urge chief justice to step in over 'abuse of power'\n\nDemocrats have called on the supreme court chief justice, John Roberts, to step in to protect a federal judge, who was targeted by Donald Trump after presiding over the Stone case. Meanwhile, another senior law enforcement official in Washington has quit after her oversight of Stone's prosecution prompted Trump to pull her nomination for a top job at the treasury. Critics of the president have described his continued attacks on the judiciary as an \"abuse of power\".\n\nHead juror. Having first criticised Stone's sentencing, Trump has now claimed the jury foreperson in the case, Tomeka Hart, had \"significant bias\", after it emerged that she was once a Democratic candidate for Congress.\n\nKudlow attacks China's 'lack of transparency' on coronavirus\n\nLarry Kudlow, the director of the US National Economic Council, has said the White House is disappointed by Beijing's \"lack of transparency\" over the coronavirus outbreak, as China's official statistics on cases continued to shift. On Friday, China added 121 new deaths to its overall toll - but also removed 108, which it claimed had been double-counted. Several affected Chinese cities are now under quarantine measures similar to those in Wuhan, in an effort to limit the continuing spread of the outbreak.\n\nGlobal spread. Three people are known to have died from the coronavirus outside mainland China: one in Hong Kong, one in the Philippines, and now one in Japan, which reported its first death on Thursday.\n\nBanker who fled Russia blames 'oppressive state machine'\n\nDmitry Ananiev, the one-time billionaire owner of a Moscow bank and senator in Russia's upper chamber, was forced to flee the country in 2017 after being threatened with fraud and money-laundering charges by Russian prosecutors. Now living in exile in Cyprus, he told the Guardian that he fell foul of the \"oppressive machine of the state\", but remains reluctant to blame Vladimir Putin directly.\n\nIn exile. Ananiev is one of a steady stream of exiles from Russia to Cyprus, Monaco and London. Some are long-term critics of Putin; others are former allies of the Russian president who \"suddenly develop an opposition voice\" after leaving Russia, write Luke Harding and Hugh Miles.\n\nCheat sheet\n\nA federal court has ordered Microsoft to stop work on its cloud computing project for the Pentagon, after Amazon sued over its loss of the $10bn contract, which it was expected to win, claiming Trump's bias against the company stymied its bid.\n\nThree female high school runners in Connecticut have filed a federal lawsuit to block transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports in the state, claiming trans participation has cost them track titles and scholarship opportunities.\n\nSeattle Against Slavery, a non-profit campaign group, says it significantly disrupted the city's sex trafficking trade by drawing tens of thousands of men into online conversations with chatbots, which posed as sex workers before delivering a deterrence message.\n\nA music fan who lost a mix tape while on holiday in Spain 25 years ago was unexpectedly reunited with her cassette when she spotted it in an exhibition of pieces made from plastic marine debris by the British artist Mandy Barker.\n\nMust-reads\n\nThe best exhibitions of Black History Month\n\nThis year's Black History Month marks the 150th anniversary of the 15th amendment, which gave black men the right to vote. Nadja Sayej selects seven art exhibitions to see across the US in February, from a visual history of hip-hop in New York, to a consideration of stereotypes from the Jim Crow era in Los Angeles.\n\nWhy the champions of civility keep losing\n\nWith rightwing demagogues and extreme partisanship on the rise across the globe, calls for a return to the civil, sensible politics of the past appear to be ignored. Benjamin Moffitt examines why moderates everywhere are failing in the fight against populism.\n\nI made bombs for al-Qaida - here's why I stopped\n\nSaudi-born Aimen Dean was inspired to become an Islamic militant by the war in the former Yugoslavia and swore an oath of allegiance to Osama bin Laden. But after the 1998 bombings of two US embassies, he says: \"I felt we were twisting our principles past breaking point. I no longer wanted to be part of it.\"\n\nWhy musicians dread careless airlines\n\nThe Malian artist Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko says US border officials broke his \"impossible to replace\" kora, a harp-like west African instrument, during a security check last week. As Amanda Holpuch learns, he is far from the first musician whose instrument has fallen victim to baggage handlers.\n\nOpinion\n\nMassachusetts is suing Juul for targeting its advertising at children and teenagers. The e-cigarette company's predatory tactics are even more appalling than you may have thought, says Nancy Jo Sales.\n\nThe lawsuit against Juul underscores the degree to which the internet and social media have increased companies' access to underage consumers.\n\nSport\n\nPel\u00e9, the former Brazil striker who remains the only footballer ever to have won the World Cup three times, has dismissed his own son's claims that his ill health has made him depressed and reclusive. \"I am good,\" the 79-year-old said. \"I continue to accept my physical limitations in the best way possible but I intend to keep the ball rolling.\"\n\nA shocking video emerged earlier this month, showing the world lightweight boxing champion Gervonta Davis choking the mother of his child in public.

That is a total of 51,986 cases in the province, according to Reuters.\n\nHowever, this is a smaller increase than yesterday, when there was a dramatic 240 new deaths and nearly 15,000 new cases.\n\nThe operators of a Norwegian cruise ship docked in Sydney Harbour say there's \"no truth\" to reports of a potential coronavirus case amongst its passengers.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line, operators of the Norwegian Jewel, said the vessel remained in operation and all the passengers were healthy.\n\n\"This morning there were various false media reports related to an illness on board our ship,\" a Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman said in a statement to AAP on Friday. \"There is absolutely no truth to this. The vessel remains in operation, and all guests onboard are in good health.\"\n\nNSW Health told AAP on Friday that while no passengers of the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship had visited mainland China in the past 14 days they were being screened for the illness for precautionary reasons.\n\nA passenger on board a cruise ship that docked in Sydney harbour Friday morning has reportedly been taken for testing for a possible case of novel coronavirus.\n\nThe Singaporean national fell ill with a respiratory illness and was taken from the Norwegian Jewel shortly after it docked at the international passenger terminal at Circular Quay at 6am this morning.\n\nThe man is being tested as a precaution. He has not yet been confirmed as having the virus.\n\nOther passengers have been allowed to disembark from the ship, after earlier being kept on board as a precaution.\n\nThe Norwegian Jewel, registered in the Bahamas, is a 15-year-old cruise ship with a capacity of nearly 2,400 passengers.\n\nIt departed from Dunedin four days ago, having been sailing between ports in New Zealand.\n\nThe cruise ship operator has been contacted for comment.\n\nThis is Naaman Zhou bringing you the latest coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. These are the top developments:\n\nA surge in recorded cases in China's Hubei province is caused by a new reporting method, not an increase in the severity or mortality of the disease. Japan recorded its first death, only the third coronavirus fatality outside mainland China. Meanwhile, Singapore recorded its biggest daily jump in cases, with eight new infected patients. The first British coronavirus evacuees flown back to the UK from Wuhan, China, have left quarantine, shouting \"we're free\" and thanking staff for their compassion \"in our time of turmoil\". A Wuhan evacuee became the 15th coronavirus case in the US. Oil demand is set to fall year on year in the first quarter for the first time since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. The WHO chief has said the outbreak could still go in \"any direction\".\n\nYou can get in touch with me on naaman.zhou@theguardian.com or on Twitter @naamanzhou", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

fake news on social media during infectious disease outbreaks, including the current novel coronavirus epidemic, can cost lives, according to researchers.\n\nAbout 40% of people in the UK believe at least one conspiracy theory of some kind, say the researchers from East Anglia University. The figures are even higher in the United States and other parts of the world.\n\nTheir study, supported by Public Health England, looked at the impact of scare stories, rumours and false information about diseases such as norovirus, flu and monkeypox, shared on sites such as Twitter. It found that people who believed them were less likely to behave in a way that would protect themselves and others, such as washing their hands frequently and keeping away from other people if they have any symptoms.\n\nProf Paul Hunter, who is an expert on the new coronavirus infection, now called Covid-19, and Dr Julii Brainard, who are from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said efforts to disseminate correct information across social media and correct the false stories could save lives.\n\nHunter said: \"Fake news is manufactured with no respect for accuracy, and is often based on conspiracy theories.\n\n\"When it comes to Covid-19, there has been a lot of speculation, misinformation and fake news circulating on the internet - about how the virus originated, what causes it and how it is spread.\n\n\"Misinformation means that bad advice can circulate very quickly - and it can change human behaviour to take greater risks.\n\n\"We have already seen how the rise of the anti-vax movement has created a surge in measles cases around the world.\n\n\"People in west Africa affected by the Ebola outbreak were more likely to practise unsafe burial practices if they believed misinformation. And here in the UK, 14% of parents have reported sending their child to school with symptoms of contagious chickenpox - violating school policies and official quarantine advice.\n\n\"Examples of risky behaviour during infectious disease outbreaks include not washing hands, sharing food with ill people, not disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces, and failing to self-isolate.\n\n\"Worryingly, people are more likely to share bad advice on social media than good advice from trusted sources such as the NHS, Public Health England or the World Health Organization.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at the effect of two strategies for combating the fake news. One was to reduce the amount of misinformation on social media. The other was to educate people to recognise false information when they saw it - something they call \"immunising\" people against it.\n\nBoth tactics had some success, said Brainard. \"But while we used very sophisticated simulation models, it is important to remember that this is not an observational study based on real behaviour,\" she said.\n\n\"The efficacy of implementing such strategies to fight fake news needs to be tested in real-world settings, with costs and benefits ideally compared with real-world disease reduction.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

outbreaks", "body": "Group says tackling crises such as coronavirus could become harder without access to EU's early warning system\n\nTackling global outbreaks such as coronavirus could become harder if the UK loses access to the EU's early warning system for cross-border threats without finding an effective replacement, according to an alliance of health bodies.\n\nPublic health is at risk if health is not made a priority in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU, according to the Brexit Health Alliance (BHA), an umbrella group led by the NHS Confederation which encompasses the NHS, medical research, industry, patients and public health bodies.\n\nThe BHA has urged the government to prioritise continued cooperation with key EU agencies, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and access platforms like the early warning and response system to deal with serious cross-border public health threats, such as pandemics and infectious diseases.\n\n\"Infectious diseases do not respect borders and we need to tackle them together,\" said Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation and BHA co-chair.\n\n\"It is in all our interests to maintain these vital links between the UK and the EU not least because working together we are more likely to trace and tackle serious outbreaks effectively.\"\n\nLast week Boris Johnson said there was \"no need\" for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules and has previously stated that the UK could \"develop separate and independent policies\" in a range of fields.\n\nThe alliance has also called for guarantees that critical medicines and medical devices will continue to be able to flow into and out of the UK and Europe, and that UK and EU residents should be able to access affordable healthcare when travelling in EU member states. It called on the government to ensure there was a continued role for the UK in Europe-wide research.\n\n\"Our worry is that all sides in these negotiations are under massive time pressures to agree a future trade deal and so there is a risk that the safety and health of patients and citizens across Europe could be overlooked,\" said Dickson.\n\n\"There is no reason why leaving the EU should mean that the UK and the EU cannot maintain existing arrangements but if we are to achieve this health has to be seen as a priority, alongside business, in the negotiations. We would also like to see early agreements to protect patient safety, give citizens rights to healthcare, provide access to medicines and support medical research.\"\n\nThe Department of Health has

"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/huge-rise-coronavirus-cases-raises-doubts-scale-epidemic-china", "title": "Huge rise in coronavirus cases casts doubt over scale of epidemic", "body": "The true scale of the epidemic caused by the new coronavirus in Hubei province has been thrown into doubt after the Chinese authorities reported more than 13,300 extra cases going back over an unknown number of days or weeks.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said the huge jump in cases in Hubei, bringing the total to more than 60,000 worldwide, was due to a change in the way Chinese authorities are counting them.\n\nCases where doctors have seen chest infection on a CT scan are now being classed as coronavirus rather than just those confirmed by a lab test result, leading to a 254 rise in deaths to a total of 1,370 since the outbreak began.\n\nIn addition to the 13,332 extra cases, Chinese authorities on Thursday reported a further 1,820 laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\nThe WHO is now working hard to try to get further details of when the extra cases of what is now being called COVID-19 occurred, to have a true picture of how the epidemic has been developing in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei.\n\n\"Most of these [additional] cases relate to a period going back days or weeks,\" said Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO's head of emergencies. \"It is retrospective reporting. It is largely due to how cases are being diagnosed and reported.\"\n\nOn the positive side, it meant Hubei's doctors would be able to report cases more quickly because they no longer have to wait for lab confirmation, said Ryan.\n\nThe political fallout from the outbreak also escalated on Thursday with the firing of Hubei's party chief, the party chief of Wuhan and the head of China's Hong Kong and Macau affairs office. Ying Yong, the new party chief of Hubei, came up through the ranks in Zhejiang - where President Xi Jinping, previously served as party secretary - and was also part of anti-corruption campaigns, the president's signature initiative.\n\n\"This is clearly Xi's move,\" said Dali Yang, a professor of political science focusing on China at the University of Chicago. \"The stakes are high and he needed time to find the right people for the positions to salvage the Hubei, Wuhan situation.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the state-run China Daily reported that a powerful Beijing official parachuted into Wuhan to supervise the fight against the virus had reprimanded local officials for failing to organise treatment quickly enough for people reporting to hospitals with symptoms.\n\nThursday's jump in infections may have been another impetus for the purges. \"I suspect Xi would have wanted the personnel change to project a sense that he is in control of the situation. The bad numbers undermine that message,\" said Sam Crane, who teaches Chinese politics and ancient philosophy at Williams College in the US.\n\nProf Paul Hunter, a coronavirus expert from the University of East Anglia, said cases that in the past would only have been considered suspect would now fall into the confirmed bracket. Many would be COVID-19 cases that would have been confirmed if lab tests had been done, but the figures would also include some people who had pneumonia not caused by the coronavirus.\n\n\"The issue remains how are we going to be able to say what is happening with the trajectory of the outbreak when the cases definitions change midway through the epidemic?\" Hunter said. \"Will the figures be backdated? Also, what about cases that have a clinical diagnosis but negative lab tests, are they included in the confirmed cases or not?\n\n\"I have no problem with people using different case definitions but please be consistent or if you do change, run both in parallel for a few days so that no one believes the epidemic has suddenly got a lot worse. I suspect but can't be certain that the underlying trend is still downwards.\"\n\nThe rest of China is only reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. So are the 24 countries that have declared cases, which so far number 447 outside of China with two deaths - in the Philippines and Japan. \"We are not seeing a dramatic increase outside of China,\" said Ryan. The largest cluster was the 218 confirmed cases on the Japanese cruise ship Diamond Princess.\n\nNor, he said, are they seeing any significant shift in the pattern of mortality or severe illness. Those who were severely ill tended to be male and over 40 - and the more severe, the older they are, with the most dangerous cases in the 60s, 70s and 80s, Ryan said.\n\nHe suggested the best hope in the near future lay in the trials of existing antiviral drugs, which include some that are in use against Aids and HIV. Trials have started in China and it is hoped they will be extended to countries such as Singapore and Japan, which have significant numbers of cases. \"You can imagine being a frontline clinician at the moment. Knowing which drug works would be a magical gift,\" said Ryan.\n\nThe change in China to include what are known as \"probable cases\" appeared aimed at heading off complaints about the availability of tests and treatment for residents, as well as questions about whether officials have been underreporting cases.\n\nThe shortage of the testing kits has meant many sick residents have been unable to seek treatment, with hospital admission contingent on the test result. Health workers have been calling for authorities to broaden the parameters for diagnosing in order to treat more patients. Some have also questioned the reliability of the tests.\n\nThe crisis has also deepened in Hong Kong, where the education minister announced that schools would remain closed until at least the middle of March. They have been closed since the start of the lunar new year at the end of January.\n\nIn Vietnam, the authorities announced the lockdown of the commune of Son Loi, a farming region about 25 miles from Hanoi, for 20 days. Checkpoints were set up around the commune and health officials wearing protective suits sprayed disinfectant on vehicles.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

for a week", "body": "The Australian government has extended its travel ban on people who have travelled through China by another week, prime minister Scott Morrison has announced.\n\nThe ban, initially set for 14 days and due to expire on Saturday, was extended on Thursday on the advice of Australia's health authorities and the national security committee. The ban would be reviewed every week, Morrison said.\n\nAustralian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family are exempt from the ban, designed to limit the spread of the new coronavirus, now named Covid-19.\n\nPeople who have been outside China for more than 14 days and who show no symptoms of Covid-19 are also allowed to enter Australia. The ban does not apply to people who left China before 1 February.\n\nInternational students who have left China and spent 14 days in a third country before arriving in Australia will be allowed into the country after their 14-day period has elapsed.\n\nThe travel restrictions apply to the Chinese mainland only: travellers from the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau are not included in the ban.\n\nOvernight, the number of new cases of Covid-19 rose by 14,887 in the Hubei province where it first emerged - a sevenfold increase on the day before. China recorded 245 new deaths, taking the national total to 1,359.\n\nGlobally, more than 60,000 people have been infected by the virus, and 1,369 have died.\n\nThere have been 15 cases of Covid-19 in Australia, with no deaths, and five people have recovered from the virus.\n\nThere have been no recorded human-to-human transmissions of Covid-19 in the general community in Australia. All cases in Australia contracted the disease while in Wuhan, except for one person who had contact, in China, with a person with the virus.\n\nOn Thursday Morrison said arrangements to protect Australia from coronavirus \"are working\".\n\n\"This afternoon we have agreed to accept the recommendations to maintain the ban on entry restrictions on foreign nationals from mainland China for a further week. This is something we will continue to review on a weekly basis, and consider all the medical evidence on a weekly basis.\"\n\nHe encouraged Australians to support members of the Chinese Australian community, who have been subject to a range of racist responses to the outbreak.\n\n\"As we go into the weekend I encourage everyone to support Chinese-Australian businesses ... they are such an integral part of Australian life and it is important that all Australians are putting their arms around them and supporting them, in any way they can.\"\n\nHe also extended his thoughts to China, saying \"we will bounce back together\".\n\nThe prime minister said he was \"very mindful of the economic impacts\" of the extended ban, but was not currently looking at providing financial assistance to the tourism and education sectors.\n\nInternational students contributed $34bn to the Australian economy last year, and the ban is expected to result in $8bn of losses.\n\nA range of universities have delayed the start of semester, or allowed international students to enrol later. Earlier on Thursday it was revealed that China had agreed to relax some of its internet restrictions so students could study online as they waited to enter the country.\n\n\"It is still some four to six weeks before we reach a period of time when it will start impacting on the [academic] year,\" Morrison said on Thursday. \"They have put in measures like online learning which can address that for now.\"\n\nQueensland state Labor MP Kate Jones said she \"could not believe\" Morrison had not yet offered financial assistance, and that the state's tourism council had written to him \"crying out for funding\".\n\nAll people, including Australian citizens and residents, must isolate themselves for 14 days after they have left China, or if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19.\n\nAustralia's chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the continued expansion of the outbreak outside of the locked-down province of Hubei was the rationale for extending the travel ban.\n\n\"We've recommended the continuation of the travel ban for an additional week at this time. There has been significant growth in Hubei province, in other provinces in China there has been slower growth, perhaps not at the same rate as we've seen previously, but still growth.\n\n\"That is the reason why we would like to maintain the travel ban at the moment,\" he said.\n\nMurphy said if Chinese authorities were able to stop the smaller outbreaks outside of Hubei, Australia would be able to review the ban.\n\nThe chief medical officer said there had been no new cases detected in Australia, and commended those Australians who'd returned from China and \"behaved impeccably\" in adhering to self-isolation.\n\nThere are no confirmed cases among the 538 Australian citizens and permanent residents currently in quarantine on Christmas Island or Manigurr-Ma work camp in the Northern Territory.\n\nThe economic impact of the travel ban on Australia's tourism and education sectors is estimated to slash 0.5% from Australia's GDP growth in the first quarter, according to analysts from ANZ bank.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_doherty@theguardian.com", "name": "Ben Doherty", "type": "author", "isAgency":

lonely and trapped indoors may be the new normal | Brigid Delaney", "body": "Between the air pollution, storms and coronavirus, out there feels feels increasingly unsafe and unpredictable\n\nThis summer has seen mother nature banish us to our bedrooms.\n\nIt's been the summer of staying indoors - whether you're in Australia sheltering from violent storms and avoiding the worst air quality in the world, or abroad, stuck in your hotel room, cruise ship cabin or apartment trying not to infect or be infected with coronavirus.\n\nIt's impossible to tell if this mass banishment indoors is just a temporary thing - a strange confluence of events (weather patterns, rapid spread of mysterious virus) - or whether this is the new normal. As the world out there feels increasingly unsafe and unpredictable, are we going to spend more and more time inside?\n\nAlready as a society we're showing a preference for the indoors life. From the comfort of our couch we order in UberEats or Deliveroo rather than go out to a restaurant, we stream movies at home rather than go to the cinema, we talk to our friends on group chat rather than meeting up at the pub, we meet people through dating apps rather than on the dancefloors or at bars, and we'll exercise at home - following a YouTube tutorial such as the highly popular Yoga with Adrienne - rather than attend a class.\n\nIn overcrowded, hot cities such as Cairo, leaving your apartment for anything from a haircut to a blood test has become such a hassle that a micro economy has sprung up in delivering goods and services. For a few dollars someone will come to your house and wax your bikini line or deliver you the paper and a coffee.\n\nOne man told the New York Times: \"There is no incentive to go outside. Just one hour outside is enough to ruin anyone's day.\"\n\nIt's probably a good thing we're getting more and more habituated to spending time at home, as increasingly we are finding ourselves confined there, but not by choice.\n\nRight now tens of millions of people in China are either in self-imposed or forced quarantine, thousands are stuck in their cabins on infected cruise ships, and others have been quarantined in detention centres, air force bases and disused mining camps.\n\nIn Australia, appalling air quality from the bushfires meant schools kept their students indoors at lunch and recess, and parents were not letting their kids play outside.\n\nFriends who are runners have complained they couldn't exercise outside during the haze, and everything from music festivals to fun runs were cancelled due to fires and poor air quality.\n\nEastern New South Wales got another taste of cabin fever when 550mm of rain fell across parts of NSW last weekend. Sydney recorded its heaviest rain in three decades and was battered by gale-force winds.\n\nOn Sunday, the worst day of the storm, I was trapped at a friend's house in North Bondi. I had stuff to do, people to meet, food to buy!! - but leaving seemed ... dangerous.\n\nRain came in over the golf course across the road in vast, thick sheets. I saw no one on the street all day, except for a lone man with a dog. Both appeared to be walking sideways.\n\nThe pair disappeared over the hill, towards the cliffs, presumably never to be heard from again.\n\nOn the balcony, the gales knocked over and smashed large terracotta pots, the rain came in sideways - in both directions - colliding then being picked up by the wind and swirled in the air in a mini-tornado. All I could do was sit on the couch and watch it in horror as the ceiling leaked in the bedroom, ruining the carpet, and the wind sounded like someone badly imitating a ghost. Woooooo ... woooooooooo ...\n\nOrdering UberEats was out of the question. It would be cruel, possibly psychotic, to insist that some young person on a pushbike and zero hours contract deliver a burrito while dodging flying debris and falling trees. (Although restaurants will argue that they need to keep making money during bad weather.)\n\nSocialising was also cancelled. Instead I kept in touch with friends throughout the day via text (boredom was the main gripe), and passively, through watching each other's Instagram stories of sodden carpets, scared pets and knocked-up pantry dinners.\n\nExpect more of it - these weather \"events\" are becoming more extreme and frequent across the world.\n\nJust this week, Storm Dennis and a few days earlier Ciara hit the UK with \"snow showers combine(d) with strong winds\". Up to 10cm of snow was forecast in higher areas, hardly ideal weather to be out and about.\n\nPeople are coping in different ways with being trapped indoors.\n\nOne man confined in China has run 50km around his living room.\n\n\"I have not been outside for many days, today I cannot bear sitting down any more!\" the amateur marathon runner posted last week.\n\nMeanwhile an Australian couple quarantined in their cabin on a cruise ship for 14 days \"kept the party flowing by getting a drone to deliver wine (pinot noir) straight to their cabin\".\n\nHaving been quarantined myself, in 2012 for whooping cough, I can tell you it's no fun.\n\nAfter being sent home from the doctor and told not to leave the house for two weeks, I had to isolate myself. I couldn't go into work (apologies Microsoft!), my flatmate had to move in with her girlfriend until the contagion had passed, and I switched my entire life - everything from socialising to grocery shopping - online.\n\nIf I didn't die of whooping cough, I thought I would die of boredom.\n\nI was going stir crazy sitting inside staring at the walls, not to mention lonely. Little did I know, I had glimpsed the future.\n\nBrigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

"Italian couple's footage against backdrop of Myanmar's 'holy land' provokes outrage\n\nOutrage is growing in Myanmar after the emergence of a 12-minute pornographic video shot in Bagan, the country's best-known tourist spot and Unesco heritage site featuring thousands of revered Buddhist pagodas.\n\nThe video was posted on PornHub by users who described themselves as a 23-year-old Italian couple.\n\nThe couple's naked antics against the backdrop of one of Bagan's ancient pagodas have provoked an angry reaction in Myanmar, with condemnation spreading online.\n\n\"Our Bagan pagodas are the Holy Land,\" wrote Mg Khin Gyi on Facebook with multiple angry emojis.\n\nThe video had been viewed nearly a quarter of a million times by Thursday evening - but had registered twice as many dislikes as likes.\n\nThe managing director of New Fantastic Asia tour company, Tun Tun Naing, questioned what seemed to be \"negligent\" security at Bagan and called for action.\n\nMyo Yee, the Mandalay chairman of the Union of Myanmar Travel Association, added his voice to the rising clamour, saying the case was bad news for an industry hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"It's a difficult time for us because not many tourists are coming here,\" he told AFP.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

2019.\n\nLike other coronaviruses, it originated in animals and then migrated to humans. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals. China's national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission of the virus.\n\nThe virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs, as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.\n\nNew and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.\n\nWe don't yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won't know until more data comes in. The mortality rate seems to be about 2%. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.\n\nAnother key unknown, of which scientists should get a clearer idea in the coming weeks, is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population - elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems - to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.\n\nThe name was announced on 11 February by the World Health Organization. The director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said \"We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease. Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

is Covid-19 - the virus causing the illness that started in Wuhan?\n\nIt is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals.\n\nHave there been other coronaviruses?\n\nNew and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.\n\nWhat are the symptoms caused by the Wuhan coronavirus?\n\nThe virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.\n\nIs the virus being transmitted from one person to another?\n\nChina's national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 13 February there are now just under 60,000 confirmed cases and 1,380 deaths in mainland China. A change in the way the metrics were calculated has lead to a large jump in the number of acknowledged cases.\n\nThere are cases in 28 other countries outside China, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.\n\nThere are nine cases of the virus in the UK. Four were located in Brighton, one in London. At Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside 83 people in quarantine were told they would be allowed to leave on Thursday after they all tested negative. Of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, more than 99% had been negative.\n\nWhy is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?\n\nWe don't yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won't know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.\n\nAnother key unknown, of which scientists should get a clearer idea in the coming weeks, is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population - elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems - to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.\n\nShould I go to the doctor if I have a cough?\n\nAnyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last two weeks and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath should stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild, the NHS advises.\n\nIs the outbreak a pandemic?\n\nHealth experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \"the worldwide spread of a disease\". Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO's list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority are travellers who picked up the virus in China.\n\nShould we panic?\n\nNo. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a \"window of opportunity\" to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.\n\nHealthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

"More than 100,000 patients waited more than four hours to be treated in hospitals\n\nMore than 100,000 A&E patients waited for hours to be treated in hospitals in January, the highest number since records began, NHS figures show.\n\nThere were 100,578 patients delayed more than four hours, of whom 2,846 waited more than 12 hours from decision to admit to admission, according to performance statistics released by NHS England.\n\nFor both delays, this is the highest number of \"trolley waits\" since records began.\n\nIt is an increase of 20.4% and 353.9% respectively from the same month a year ago, when there were 83,554 four-hour waits and just 627 12-hour waits.\n\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said the figures showed the strain on the NHS was \"relentless, deepening and showing no sign of recovery\".\n\nThe BMA council chairman, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said: \"With nearly 200,000 people waiting over four hours on a trolley so far this winter - 56,000 more than the same time last year - and almost six times more people waiting over 12 hours on trolleys this winter compared to last, the government is simply failing to get a grip on winter pressures.\n\n\"Stories of patient deaths on corridors, rammed emergency departments and cancellations of patients' procedures as a daily occurrence are becoming the new norm as doctors across the country say they are exhausted and run into the ground.\n\n\"This is an unacceptable situation for a civilised health service; it is failing patients and is not sustainable.\"\n\nThe NHS figures also show that ambulances attended 750,238 incidents in January, making it the busiest January on record.\n\nAn NHS spokeswoman said January had seen improved A&E performance and faster ambulance response times compared with December.\n\nShe said: \"This was aided by the sustained hard work of NHS staff, and the ability to open and staff more hospital beds than last year.\n\n\"This means that the NHS is well prepared to deal with the potential impact of coronavirus, although it remains important that anyone with health concerns should contact NHS 111.\"\n\nDr Nick Scriven of the Society for Acute Medicine said: \"The fact the NHS is teetering on the brink is now such common knowledge that it is no longer a shock to see continuous failure to meet performance targets and, even today, with the figures showing the worst ever performance against emergency targets since data collection began, it will barely raise an eyebrow.\"\n\nHe added: \"This performance data, however, is not any reflection on the mammoth efforts of frontline staff to deliver in almost impossible circumstances; something reinforced by those who battled last weekend's wild weather for their patients.\"\n\nThe shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \"Years of Tory underfunding, bed cuts and mismanagement have pushed the NHS to the brink.\n\n\"Without funded plans for social care, public health and a credible strategy to recruit the staff needed, patients will continue to languish on trolleys or wait longer in pain and distress for treatment.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

"body": "The defiant lyrics to the classic Les Mis\u00e9rables track are reverberating through uprisings in Hong Kong and China\n\nIt has soared during an airport sit-in, united street protests and drowned out the Chinese national anthem at a school assembly. Do You Hear the People Sing?, the defiant chorus from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables, has become a song of protest in Hong Kong and, more recently, mainland China. Explicit references to Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor censured for his warnings about the coronavirus outbreak, and to Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, are stamped upon - but lines from the song slip through the net on China's social networks Weibo and WeChat, fostering a community of covert opposition.\n\nYou may hear the people sing on China's streets, but not on its streaming platforms - the authorities have responded to the song's incendiary impulse by removing it as an individual number and scrubbing it from the soundtrack albums. \"Do you hear the people of Hong Kong?\" wrote Herbert Kretzmer, author of the English lyrics, last summer. \"At 93, I can only be with them in spirit. But my words are on their lips - and I am singing with them, too.\"\n\nThe song evokes the Paris uprising of 1832, when protesters briefly sought to overthrow the government, galvanised by the funeral of a reforming general. Victor Hugo, then a young playwright, sheltered from the bullets between barricades. Thirty years later, he captured the experience in Les Mis\u00e9rables, which continues to find new audiences via Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Sch\u00f6nberg's musical.\n\nAs the ardent Paris students rally at the climax of the first act, a solo high baritone and drum are gradually joined by more voices and more instruments. The camera in Tom Hooper's 2012 film version picks out individual faces - Eddie Redmayne, Fra Fee - before pulling back to show the defiant crowd swirling flags and eddying around Napoleon's monument, the Elephant of the Bastille. Kretzmer believes the song endures because it addresses \"injustice, which can turn men and women into slaves, cause anger and humiliation and crush the human spirit\".\n\nBoubil and Sch\u00f6nberg often veer towards bombast, which makes their signature chorus ripe for parody. Saturday Night Live had a lobster resisting its place on the menu (\"Do you hear the lobster scream / Screaming the scream of scalding flames?\") while it also enlivened one of James Corden's Crosswalk Musical skits. Playing a vainglorious theatre director, he led hits from Les Mis (\"The greatest - and unless I'm mistaken, only - French musical\") for frosty-faced Parisians, brandishing baguettes at the barricade \"because le pain is mightier than the sword\".\n\nIt's banal when little is at stake, yet gives voice to moments of political urgency. The chorus has arisen during popular protests in the Philippines, Iraq, Turkey and Ukraine (though it isn't in the repertoire of France's gilet jaunes). Even in less pressured circumstances, it fosters pride in the scrappy underdog: a Louisiana anthropology student, Heather Moats, tweaked the title for her thesis on often-scorned community theatre as she shadowed an amateur production of Les Mis in Baton Rouge. One performer described the communal endeavour as \"a form of fellowship at the church of Misfit Toys\".\n\nCommitment to community isn't necessarily progressive, and Do You Hear ... can also be co-opted for a hit of populist emotion. During his 2016 election campaign, it welcomed Donald Trump to a rally in Miami alongside images retitling the musical Les Deplorables (after Hillary Clinton described his supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\"). The musical, slapping you across the chops with fervour, isn't universally loved - screenwriter Andrew Davies, adapting Hugo's novel for the BBC (2018), scorned it as a \"shoddy farrago\".\n\nFor the Royal Shakespeare Company's 1985 British premiere, John Napier designed a barricade which, wrote Michael Coveney, \"seems to contain a city in itself, a fantastic jumble of chairs, barrels, planks and people,\" and defined the stage production for more than 30 years. (A redesigned version recently opened at Cameron Mackintosh's swankily refurbished Sondheim theatre in London.)\n\nIn retrospect, perhaps, the RSC was an apt home for a musical with some parallels to a Shakespeare history play: individual grudge plays against political unrest, and no one escapes unbruised. However urgent it is when Do You Hear ... gives communal voice to protest, the chorus is nonetheless an anthem of the soon-to-be defeated. Though its final reprise ends, as Kretzmer notes, \"with the words 'When tomorrow comes' - because I truly believe that hope can never be extinguished\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

person diagnosed with coronavirus in London turned up unannounced at a hospital in an Uber taxi after falling ill, the Guardian has been told.\n\nTwo staff from Lewisham hospital in south London are now in isolation at home after coming into contact with the woman, a Chinese national who had recently arrived in the capital from China.\n\nLewisham hospital on Thursday confirmed the unnamed patient had not followed public health officials' advice and had simply \"self-presented\" at its A&E unit last Sunday afternoon.\n\nShe did not arrive by ambulance or her own private vehicle and went straight to the A&E reception desk to report her symptoms - both clear breaches of guidance aimed at stopping the spread of the virus.\n\nHowever, no other patients were exposed to the risk of infection by the manner of her arrival, the hospital said.\n\nThe woman was then sent home pending the results of her tests. On Wednesday she was taken to another London hospital, St Thomas', for treatment.\n\nIn a message to staff, Ben Travis, the chief executive of the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS trust, said: \"We wanted to let you know that we have had a confirmed case of coronavirus from a patient who self-presented at the A&E department of University hospital Lewisham (UHL) last Sunday (9 February).\n\n\"The test result was confirmed as positive yesterday (Wednesday 12 February) and we have been in touch with all staff who came into contact with the patient. The patient went to [a specialist unit at] St Thomas' yesterday evening, so we are now able to update all staff.\"\n\nDescribing how the patient came to seek help and the hospital's response, Travis added: \"In this case, the patient self-presented at our A&E. As soon as the patient did this, the patient was given a mask and then escorted to be tested in the dedicated area we have assigned for coronavirus testing outside the A&E building - while awaiting the installation of a purpose-built 'pod'.\n\n\"As further assessment was required, the patient was then taken to a dedicated isolation room in the emergency department. In line with our protocols, throughout their care the patient was escorted and did not come into contact with other patients. The patient was later discharged and taken home by London ambulance service.\"\n\nAs a result of her walking straight into the A&E, rather than going to the ambulance bay to be met by trained doctors and nurses in hazmat suits, some staff may have been been exposed to a risk of infection.\n\nTravis added: \"All staff who had direct contact with the patient have been contacted, including two members of staff who are undergoing active surveillance at home for a 14-day period as a precautionary measure - following the advice of Public Health England.\"\n\nMedia reports have said the woman rang NHS 111 before going to the hospital and the hospital was expecting a patient with suspected coronavirus. But staff there also said it was unclear why, despite apparent contact with NHS 111, she still came in by taxi, given that the NHS telephone advice line would have called her an ambulance or advised her to go in a private vehicle.\n\nStaff at the hospital said they were worried the patient's behaviour could have led to some of them, and some of the patients in the A&E at the time, catching coronavirus. Some are also concerned that the Uber driver who took her there may be at risk, and possibly others in his car later.\n\nDave Smith, the chair of the Royal College of Nursing's Emergency Care Association, said: \"It's worrying to hear that the public aren't following Public Health England advice about phoning NHS 111 to seek advice, and therefore putting other members of the public and NHS staff at risk of contracting coronavirus.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "denis_campbell@theguardian.com", "name": "Denis

until summer", "body": "Prof Chris Whitty says a four-point tactical plan is in place to help country cope with virus\n\nBritain is hoping to delay any possible outbreak of coronavirus in order to prepare the NHS if it cannot be contained, the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has said.\n\n\"If we are going to get an outbreak here in the UK, and it is an if, not a when, putting it back in time into the summer away from the winter pressures on the NHS ... is a big advantage,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nBut he added that the country should not rely on the change of the seasons coming to the rescue \"in any way\", adding that a four-point tactical plan was in place for the UK.\n\n\"At this point in time ... we have a strategy that relies on four tactical aims. The first is to contain, the second is to delay, the third is to do the science and the research, and the fourth is to mitigate so that we can actually brace the NHS,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the future prevalence of coronavirus was heavily dependent on what happened in China and that currently the situation could go \"one of two ways.\"\n\n\"The first way is that China gets on top of the epidemic ... and that there are spillover cases all over the world but those are contained and we will have cases in the UK - that is highly likely, we may even get a bit of onward transmission in the UK - and then the epidemic goes away,\" he said.\n\n\"The alternative is this is not possible to contain in China and then this starts to spread, probably initially quite slowly around the world and at that point unless the seasons come to our rescue then it is going to come to a situation where we have it in the EU, and in the UK.\"\n\nAsked about the new case in London, Whitty said that officials were not in touch with everyone who had been on the same plane as the person who is now confirmed to have the virus, just those who had been in close proximity. Further infection of people who were outside that vicinity was unlikely, he added.\n\nWhitty added that finding a vaccine in the short term was unlikely and impractical, suggesting that work on exploring the use of anti-viral drugs was a better focus. \"People talk about vaccines, it will in my view be a long while until we have a vaccine that is ready to deploy but we need to get on with that,\" he said. \"We need to look at existing drugs, like existing HIV drugs - and the Chinese are starting to do this - and test if the existing drugs work against this virus. Some may, some may not.\"\n\nBut he added that work had to be focused on containing the virus and delaying its spread as any drugs were only likely to be useful for a minority of people, as most who caught the virus would have few or no symptoms.\n\nWhitty said that people in the UK should not be changing their behaviour but taking sensible precautions to avoid getting any virus, such as covering their mouths with a handkerchief or tissue when sneezing or coughing and throwing used tissues away safely.\n\nOn the Today programme on Wednesday, Prof Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease expert from Imperial College London, said he thought new cases of the virus could still arise and the world was in the \"early phases of a global pandemic\". He estimated about 60% of the UK population in such a situation could be affected, which if the mortality rate was 1% could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.\n\nBut Whitty said it was unhelpful to speculate on numbers without strong evidence. He said the fourth strand of the UK coronavirus plan was mitigation, and ensuring the NHS was able to cope.\n\n\"The best estimate for the number of people dying at the top end of the range is about 2%; in my view it could be considerably less than that, but we have to prepare for the worst,\" he said. It was wrong to speculate on any potential death toll figures, he said. \"It is a mistake to use numbers which are entirely speculative ... At the moment the numbers we are seeing out of China are so variable that it is really difficult to put a fixed figure.\"\n\nWhile he said it was possible that \"an epidemic is rolling our way\", Whitty said he would only talk about the potential number of people who could be affected when the facts were clear. Commenting on the figures that came out of China on Thursday, which rose sharply after authorities changed the way they calculate the figures, Whitty said any irregularity in the numbers coming out of the country were not \"deliberately misleading\" but instead the \"reality is taking a long time to catch up with the facts\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

woes", "body": "Carmaker expects 43% profits slump amid problems including Carlos Ghosn civil actions\n\nNissan slumped to its first quarterly loss since 2010 as weak sales added to the problems faced by the automotive manufacturer, amid continued battles with its former chairman Carlos Ghosn.\n\nThe Japanese carmaker reported a net loss of \u00a526.1bn (\u00a3183m) between October and December, and also said it would not pay out a dividend at the end of its financial year.\n\nIt expects profits to slump to \u00a585bn (\u00a3596m) for the financial year ending 31 March, 43% down on the previous year.\n\nThe lowered outlook came as revenues and operating profits fell steeply for the first nine months of its financial year. Revenues were down by 12.5% between April and December, while operating profits plummeted by 82.7% to \u00a554.3bn.\n\nThe company blamed \"weak performance and a slowdown in total industry volume\" for the slump, which has added to the pressure on its new chief executive, Makoto Uchida.\n\n\"We are making progress, but sales volumes have been weak so we need to do more restructuring than initially planned,\" Uchida said.\n\nNissan is battling a host of problems, including a sales slump linked to an ageing product lineup and heavy discounting. It also faces the need, shared by all major carmakers, to conserve cash as it invests heavily in electric and autonomous vehicle technology. The company is cutting 12,500 jobs worldwide, in a plan announced in July.\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus outbreak has not yet been factored into its forecasts. Car sales are all but certain to slump in China, and Nissan has said that it will temporarily halt production at a plant in Kyushu, in Japan, because of strain on supply chains, on top of shutdowns in Chinese factories.\n\nThe company has been dogged by problems triggered by Ghosn's departure, with Uchida having to cope with political manoeuvring between Nissan and its partners in the world's biggest carmaking alliance, France's Renault and Japan's Mitsubishi.\n\nNissan has been distracted by the saga surrounding the arrest and subsequent dramatic escape of Ghosn, who was the driving force behind the alliance.\n\nGhosn was arrested in November 2018 after Nissan executives reported him to authorities over allegations he had understated his income. However, he escaped from Tokyo by private jet to Lebanon, avoiding a trial, and has since railed against perceived injustice, blaming \"unscrupulous, vindictive individuals\" at the carmaker for conspiring to bring him down, as well as likening his case to the Pearl Harbor attacks.\n\nNissan is now pursuing Ghosn in civil actions to try to recover costs it said were related to corruption. Ghosn has denied all the claims.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jasper_jolly@theguardian.com", "name": "Jasper Jolly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nissan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Ghosn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Ghosn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitsubishi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyushu"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attack on Pearl Harbor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Salesmanship", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Salesmanship", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Lunchboxes", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Lunchboxes", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9068cb55c96a79fdaff6c9a5e38c36a5b2b02e1/3_1040_6081_3648/master/6081.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f97a73a494877d6c72d600a3bd0b0bd5", "eventUri": "eng-5503226", "location": null, "shares": {}, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1446321704", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-13", "time": "12:00:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-13T12:00:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-13T11:44:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/13/record-bribery-fine-fuels-airbus-loss-of-14bn", "title": "Record bribery fine fuels Airbus loss of \u20ac1.4bn", "body": "Aircraft maker reports record deliveries but bumper year offset by \u20ac3.6bn set aside to cover corporate fines\n\nAirbus has slumped to a \u20ac1.4bn (\u00a31.17bn) annual loss after receiving record fines for bribery, but raised its dividend as aircraft deliveries hit an all-time high.\n\nThe commercial aircraft maker's 2019 loss contrasts with a net profit of \u20ac3.1bn the previous year.\n\nThe Toulouse-based company had to set aside \u20ac3.6bn last month to cover settlements with authorities in the US, France and Britain after admitting it had paid huge bribes on an \"endemic\" basis to secure contracts in 20 countries. The penalties amount to the largest-ever corporate fine issued for bribery.\n\nAirbus also lost \u20ac1.2bn last year due to problems with its A400M military transport programme, and a further \u20ac221m because the German government extended a ban on export licences to Saudi Arabia through March.\n\nHowever, revenues climbed 11% to \u20ac70.5bn last year, and Airbus said it would pay a dividend of \u20ac1.80 a share, up 9%. It delivered a record 863 commercial planes in 2019, up from 800 in 2018, including 112 A350s and 642 A320s. The group expects deliveries to rise further this year, to 880 commercial aircraft.\n\nAirbus boosted orders to 768 last year as its main rival, Boeing, struggled following the grounding of the 737 Max jet after two crashes killed 346 people.\n\nAdjusted operating profits, excluding the settlement and other one-offs, rose 19% to \u20ac6.9bn last year and were expected to reach \u20ac7.5bn in 2020, Airbus said. Its forecast assumes there are no major disruptions to the global economy and air traffic, including from the coronavirus.\n\n\"We achieved a great deal in 2019,\" said the Airbus chief executive, Guillaume Faury. \"The level of confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth going forward has led to a dividend proposal of \u20ac1.80 per share. Our focus in 2020 will be on reinforcing our company culture, improving operationally, and adjusting our cost structure to strengthen the financial performance and prepare for the future.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_kollewe@theguardian.com", "name": "Julia Kollewe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A400M_Atlas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A400M Atlas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A350_XWB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A350 XWB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A320 family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Faury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guillaume Faury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d017e8f36b6b53dbfebfdbee144365b771970c1/0_98_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f693d89431c339159ac8505fd6d8cc88", "eventUri": "eng-5509304", "location": null, "shares": {}, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1450117247", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-16", "time": "20:16:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-16T20:16:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-16T20:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/17/morning-mail-questions-over-aged-care-grant-coronavirus-cruise-ship-crisis-toxic-kitties", "title": "Morning mail: questions over aged-care grant, coronavirus cruise ship crisis, toxic kitties", "body": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 17 February.\n\nTop stories\n\nThe Coalition gave an \"unprecedented\" $400,000 grant to the administrators of a now-closed aged care home in the electorate of Nationals MP Damian Drum, prompting Labor to question why other financially stressed providers have missed out. In November, Drum, the MP for the Victorian seat of Nicholls, said the financial assistance from the federal government meant the centre was \"staying open, end of story\", claiming \"there are no conversations about shutting the place down\". But despite the financial injection, residents from the 40-bed home have been relocated and employees made redundant, with the home shutting its doors last week.\n\nA three-year-old Australian girl held in al-Hawl camp in Syria will likely lose her fingers to frostbite. Amirah is one of 47 Australian children being detained in the sprawling detention camp for the family members of Islamic State fighters, as the north-east of Syria endures a bitterly cold winter. Amirah's five-month-old brother Yahya, who was born in the camp, is also malnourished. An older brother died before the family reached the camp. Other Australian children in the camp are reported to be suffering developmental disorders, diarrhoea, seizures, rickets and asthma. The youngest child in the Australian group is less than two months old.\n\nQuestions are being raised over a decision to let cotton farms harvest first rainfall in years. New South Wales bureaucrats sought urgent advice from major cotton farmers about how recent rainfall might damage their water harvesting infrastructure, in an apparent effort to justify giving them the green light to retain the first rainfall in over a year, rather than letting it flow downstream. On 7 February the government announced it would restrict the harvesting of overland flows throughout the northern Murray-Darling Basin for the first time, because it was \"in the public interest\". But within days, the government had lifted the ban for two valleys and part of a third.\n\nAustralia\n\nThe first cohort of Australian evacuees are set to leave quarantine on Christmas Island on Monday, with no reported cases of the new coronavirus among the 277 Australian citizens and permanent residents held on the island.\n\nNationals leader Michael McCormack has declared he will lead the party to the next election, dismissing suggestions he will stand down within the next two years to ensure stability within the Coalition.\n\nLabor is accusing the government of shortchanging rural areas through the $150m sports fund, which was overwhelmingly spent in marginal seats during the election campaign.\n\nThe world\n\nA woman let off a cruise ship in Cambodia has tested positive for coronavirus. Scores of passengers who left the MS Westerdam, which had been at sea for two weeks after leaving Hong Kong on 1 February, have since travelled on to other destinations. Meanwhile the US is set to evacuate hundreds of American passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, as local health authorities said a further 70 people onboard had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total to 355. And a taxi driver has died from the coronavirus in Taiwan, marking the first such death on the island and the fifth fatality outside mainland China.\n\nIn US political news, Kellyanne Conway has claimed Trump is the victim of a politicised justice system, Michael Bloomberg has insisted he is a \"champion for women in the workplace\", and Pete Buttigieg is \"not going to be lectured on family values from the likes of Rush Limbaugh.\"\n\nBritain and the European Union are going to rip each other apart in talks over a future trade deal, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has predicted, while also holding out hope that UK defence co-operation with Europe will continue.\n\nThe jury at Harvey Weinstein's rape trial in New York will begin deliberations on Tuesday, with the world's media and the expectations of the #MeToo movement bearing heavily upon them.\n\nRecommended reads\n\nAustralian researchers are pondering the link between a rare venom and cat allergies. A recent study involving the incredibly cute but atypically venomous dreamy-eyed slow loris speculates the allergic reactions cats can trigger in humans are a defence mechanism that they unwittingly evolved to fend off enemies. The University of Queensland's Bryan Fry sequenced the protein contained in the slow loris venom and used a computer program to compare it to all other known protein sequences. The cat allergen was the closest match.\n\n\"There is one image from the bushfire crisis that I am still not able to shake,\" writes Angela Williams. \"What haunts me is the image of the prisoners locked in at Lithgow Correctional Centre when others were evacuated from the path of a fire last year. My fears come from experience: I've been to prison twice for the same crime, committed in 1996. They are fears I'd met in the old sandstone cells at Berrima where I asked a guard what to do if there was a fire in the cell, and he said 'break out or burn'.\"\n\n\"The way we currently handle workplace harassment isn't working and it isn't fair,\" writes Aimee Cooper. \"One of the most frustrating things about my job is knowing just how strong our legal protections are, then seeing how rarely they are brought to life. Our equality laws are meaningless if they are not complied with, relied upon or enforced.\"\n\nListen\n\nWhat happens when the taps run dry? Dozens of Australian towns have now run out of drinking water. Residents like Fleur Magick Dennis, a Wiradjuri woman from the rural NSW town of Euchareena, have been forced to cart water by truck and are living with severe water restrictions. \"That's not a sustainable way to live. I'm just really worried about our future at the moment,\" she says in today's episode of The Frontline, a major multimedia series from Guardian Australia, is about everyday Australians who are already living with the effects of the climate emergency.\n\nSport\n\nIt's a brave supporter that suggests a trip to the A-League to their partner on Valentine's Day. Richard Parkin is one such supporter. \"The idea of trekking to an outdoor theatre during this Australian summer and placing your emotions in the hands of a football team like Adelaide United is as bold a gamble as booking a review-less modern fusion restaurant or chancing your mate's cousin's band at the corner pub.\"\n\n\"What a series, what a game, what a run chase, what a crick in the neck from repeatedly watching the ball sail through the Centurion skies,\" writes Barney Ronay, as England chase down South Africa and the T20 series.\n\nMedia roundup\n\n\"The number of asylum seekers who arrive by plane has reached a new peak in a flashpoint over border control, leaving Australia with almost 50,000 people who are yet to be deported after having their claims rejected,\" the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The ABC's Four Corners reveals \"a top Catholic boys' school is facing accusations of a culture of cover-up, after revelations its principal and dean of sport gave references for a now-convicted child sex offender but gave no support for the student during the court process.\" Backpackers are set to be granted special visas to help rebuild infrastructure destroyed in the bushfires, the Australian reports.\n\nComing up\n\nThe evacuees from Wuhan taken to Christmas Island over coronavirus fears are set to return to mainland Australia.\n\nThe federal court will hold an interlocutory hearing on a challenge to the deportation of one of the members of the Biloela family to Sri Lanka. The family are being held on Christmas Island.\n\nA judgment is expected in the ABC's challenge over AFP raids on its offices in Ultimo.\n\nSign up\n\nIf you would like to receive the Guardian

"body": "As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK climbed to eight on Monday, Guardian readers from across Britain have told of their reactions to the outbreak.\n\nThe majority of those who got in touch seemed to be under the impression that the risk of becoming infected in Britain had become more concrete, and many reported having stocked up on hand sanitisers, face masks and disposable gloves.\n\nPublic Health England has recommended that UK citizens focus on good respiratory hygiene, including covering air passages when sneezing, binning used tissues quickly and washing hands with soap often. They have also suggested avoiding close contact with people who are unwell.\n\nHowever, some readers have gone beyond official recommendations, from wearing masks in public to stockpiling food.\n\nIan*, 41, who runs a computer services business in Brighton, was one of several people who said they had purchased goggles: \"There's no reason to panic, but let's not be complacent,\" he said. \"I even have a half-mask respirator, though I hope I never need to use it.\n\n\"While it's definitely overkill, I need to make sure people can work from home if necessary, to minimise chances of infection.\"\n\nEven among those who are less worried, several people said they had started stockpiling food and other supplies, such as instant noodles.\n\nRory, 43, an assistant director in the film and TV industry from Edinburgh, said: \"I've started a small stockpile of canned and dried food. I'm trying to prepare for a 14-day quarantine or a minor interruption of food supply. My main worry is a food shortage due to panic buying in a few weeks' time.\"\n\nElsewhere in the country, people are ramping up precautions. Mark*, 69 and retired from the Isle of Wight, said he was cancelling plans in June. \"My wife and I were going to go to Santander by sea, then travel around Spain by train.\n\n\"We've postponed it now because of the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus. It makes no sense to travel unnecessarily until the virus is under control,\" he said.\n\nVarious people, from Hampshire to Manchester, expressed their refusal to travel to London, as they suspected the risk of contagion may be higher there.\n\nMary, a 29-year-old accountant from London, appears to agree, and wears an N95 mask wherever she goes. \"I have stopped going to the gym, as in my opinion it is one of the more densely crowded areas. I've also stopped using public transport and where possible I'm driving. Where I can't drive, I will either walk or use a bicycle. Social events are pretty much all cancelled,\" she said.\n\nIn other UK cities, people are increasingly concerned about leaving the house. Cathy*, 27, a wealth analyst from Birmingham, is contemplating whether she might need to work from home at some point to avoid the city centre, while James, 41, a stay-at-home dad from Swansea, is trying to limit his children's exposure to the wider public. \"We have started to row back on social engagements and have stopped taking our children to their regular hobby classes,\" he said.\n\nMel*, 69 and retired from Derby, has in effect put her family on lockdown. \"We hardly move out of the house. I had to go to the post office yesterday, but we were opening the door with tissues. We could not wait to get back home. That was the first time out in nearly two weeks.\"\n\nVarious respondents said they were likely to cancel travel plans to south-east Asia. But Matt, 38, a digital marketer from Hove whose father had visited one of the GP surgeries shortly before it closed due to a suspected coronavirus infection among staff, was still on the fence. \"I'm trying not to panic, but we are all slightly anxious,\" he said. \"The lack of concrete information and planning from the government and local council is frustrating.\"\n\nEllen, 29, a healthcare professional from Bath, has settled for pragmatism and feels that while it is tempting to stock up on supplies, all it does is create a shortage for others, which in turn leads to panic buying. \"Faces masks are of unproven benefit if not properly used. We should be cautious of fearmongering as there is no immediate need for people in the UK to upturn their lives.\n\n\"Perhaps one thing people could do without risk of harm would be to improve simple hygiene practices such as hand-washing. I have started using antibacterial gel after getting off the bus, but this is probably a bit overcautious.\"\n\n*Some names have been changed", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/13/coronavirus-hong-kong-hostility-beijing-street-protests", "title": "The coronavirus outbreak has only heightened Hong Kong's hostility towards Beijing | Ilaria Maria Sala", "body": "The street protests might be less well attended now, but resentment against the authorities is still growing\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak hit Hong Kong as the territory was still reeling from months of political unrest. Last year, the mass protests that started after the special administrative region's chief executive, Carrie Lam, attempted to introduce an extradition bill with mainland China evolved into nightly confrontations between police and demonstrators. Protesters were arrested in their thousands.\n\nThen, at the start of the year, as news of the coronavirus outbreak started to surface, an exhausted population had something else to worry about. The epidemic, which has infected more than 44,000 people and killed more than 1,100 of them, has rekindled old fears. Once more, it has made many Hong Kong citizens feel that, in a crisis, they are unable to rely on a supportive, competent government: local leaders have kept dithering, half closing the border, then closing it a little more, while being unable to even guarantee a steady supply of face masks and toilet paper. Throughout, they wait for guidance from Beijing on how to act.\n\nWhile anxiety about the spread of the coronavirus has been keeping many people at home, the protests haven't entirely ceased: they may have fewer participants, but night skirmishes are still ongoing. On Saturday, a few hundred people gathered to commemorate the death of a university student who fell while trying to escape teargas in October; police dispersed the protest and arrested 119 people. Smaller protests, too, still end with teargas, pepper spray and arrests.\n\nMeanwhile, newer forms of dissent have been emerging from last year's mobilisation. The recent strike of hospital workers, who were demanding the closure of the border with mainland China to avoid an outbreak in Hong Kong, was organised by the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, a trade union organisation that in December counted just 300 members. After a unionisation drive inspired by the general strikes organised during last year's protests, it is now 18,000-strong. The strike didn't succeed, but it showed how the protest movement in Hong Kong has evolved to integrate different types of actions and demands.\n\nThe sight of hospital workers on strike while a public health emergency is unfolding might be shocking, but it is proof of the depth of mistrust Hong Kong has towards the authorities, both here and in Beijing. After all, the territory was one of the main victims of the Sars epidemic - which originated in Guangdong in November 2002, but was kept mostly secret by the Chinese government until February 2003. China's cover-up continued well into April; meanwhile, 299 people in Hong Kong lost their lives.\n\nOnce the crisis was brought under control, the authorities signed the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Agreement (CEPA), to help Hong Kong get out of its post-Sars economic gloom. Among other things, this allowed millions of mainland tourists to visit without a visa. Neighbourhoods started to shapeshift, as old shops had to make way for new stores catering for mainlanders' desires and needs; landlords couldn't raise rents fast enough as new tenants with extravagantly priced clothes and pharmaceuticals to sell were eager to tap into the Chinese visitors' bonanza.\n\nAs the protests escalated last year, the Chinese propaganda organs on the mainland resorted to shaping the narrative in nationalistic terms: Hong Kong demonstrators were \"traitors to the motherland\" with foreign backing, they said, sparking an animosity so strong that the sides took to calling each other \"cockroaches\" (for the protesters) and \"dogs\" (for mainland Chinese). That antagonism certainly hasn't abated in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Some shops in Hong Kong have put up signs saying they will not serve \"Mandarin speakers\" or anyone from the mainland - ostensibly as a precaution against the virus, as if that gave a veneer of respectability to discrimination. In social media and in graffiti, anti-Chinese sentiment has been steady: there are widespread claims that mainlanders are hoarding masks and hand sanitiser (the long queues outside shops are, in fact, mostly filled with locals). They are blamed for depriving Hong Kong of its resources, from hospital beds to milk formula, even if a quick look around the city shows that the people profiteering from face masks and disinfectant come from across the geographical and linguistic spectrum.\n\nThis time round the Chinese government has been acting faster than it did in 2003, while still falling into its habit of suppressing news and pumping out propaganda. The Hong Kong government, on the other hand, has fumbled its response to the point that one of the richest cities in Asia finds itself without toilet paper. Even now, it is still trying to ban people from hiding their identities by wearing face masks at protests. When hospital workers were striking, Lam refused to speak with them, and introduced one half-hearted measure after another on border controls.\n\nAt the moment, most land borders are closed, but the airport is still open. Rumours thrive, and people are panic-buying: rice, toilet paper, face masks, hand sanitiser. Few doubt that once the coronavirus emergency subsides, the protests will start again: against a local government appointed from on high, which cannot even guarantee basic supplies at a time of crisis, and against the fear of being absorbed into mainland China. The hostility towards both has only been intensified by the epidemic.\n\n* Ilaria Maria Sala is a writer and journalist based in Hong Kong", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",
