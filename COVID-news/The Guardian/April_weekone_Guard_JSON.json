I thought that if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field, and we wore magnets on our wrists, then it could set off an alarm if you brought it too close to your face. A bit of boredom in isolation made me think of that.\"\n\nHowever, the academic realised the electronic part he had did the opposite - and would only complete a circuit when there was no magnetic field present.\n\n\"I accidentally invented a necklace that buzzes continuously unless you move your hand close to your face,\" he said.\n\n\"After scrapping that idea, I was still a bit bored, playing with the magnets. It's the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears - I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril and things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril.\"\n\nReardon said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils, and two on the outside. When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose, the two inside stuck together. Unfortunately, the researcher then attempted to use his remaining magnets to remove them.\n\n\"At this point, my partner who works at a hospital was laughing at me,\" he said. \"I was trying to pull them out but there is a ridge at the bottom of my nose you can't get past.\n\n\"After struggling for 20 minutes, I decided to Google the problem and found an article about an 11-year-old boy who had the same problem. The solution in that was more magnets. To put on the outside to offset the pull from the ones inside.\n\n\"As I was pulling downwards to try and remove the magnets, they clipped on to each other and I lost my grip. And those two magnets ended up in my left nostril while the other one was in my right. At this point I ran out of magnets.\"\n\nBefore attending the hospital, Reardon attempted to use pliers to pull them out, but they became magnetised by the magnets inside his nose.\n\n\"Every time I brought the pliers close to my nose, my entire nose would shift towards the pliers and then the pliers would stick to the magnet,\" he said. \"It was a little bit painful at this point.\n\n\"My partner took me to the hospital that she works in because she wanted all her colleagues to laugh at me. The doctors thought it was quite funny, making comments like 'This is an injury due to self-isolation and boredom.'\"\n\nAt the hospital, a team of two doctors applied an anaesthetic spray and manually removed the magnets from Reardon's nose.\n\n\"When they got the three out from the left nostril, the last one fell down my throat,\" he said. \"That could have been a bit of a problem if I swallowed or breathed it in, but I was thankfully able to lean forward and cough it out ... Needless to say I am not going to play with the magnets any more.\"\n\nMedical records from the emergency department said that Reardon did not have difficulty breathing, and denied the presence of further magnets up his nose.\n\nThe astrophysicist told Guardian Australia he had ruled out further experiments with the magnets and face-touching, and would find other ways to pass the time while at home.\n\n\"I'm actually getting a lot of work done,\" he said. \"Working remotely is not that bad. We are also renovating our house, so I am building shelves, making furniture and doing some tiling.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naaman_zhou@theguardian.com", "name": "Naaman Zhou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astrophysics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nostril"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guardian Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium_magnet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neodymium magnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swinburne_University_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swinburne University of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gravitational wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulsar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anesthetic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tessellation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Transformers_and_Inductors", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Transformers and Inductors", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Electromagnetism", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Nuclear_Magnetic_Resonance", "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Nuclear Magnetic Resonance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Medical_Physics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Medical Physics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Magnetic_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Magnetic Therapy", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2972461968ee1c5b588cb6ce7b01cad57b487f4b/0_439_2237_1341/master/2237.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=eae369452b6c7608cdfe57d607917ac7", "eventUri": "eng-5642434", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 49051}, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 49051, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6015072843", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-31", "time": "17:53:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-31T17:53:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-31T17:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus", "title": "Trump says Republicans would 'never' be elected again if it was easier to vote", "body": "Donald Trump admitted on Monday that making it easier to vote in America would hurt the Republican party.\n\nThe president made the comments as he dismissed a Democratic-led push for reforms such as vote-by-mail, same-day registration and early voting as states seek to safely run elections amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Democrats had proposed the measures as part of the coronavirus stimulus. They ultimately were not included in the $2.2tn final package, which included only $400m to states to help them run elections.\n\n\"The things they had in there were crazy. They had things, levels of voting that if you'd ever agreed to it, you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again,\" Trump said during an appearance on Fox & Friends. \"They had things in there about election days and what you do and all sorts of clawbacks. They had things that were just totally crazy and had nothing to do with workers that lost their jobs and companies that we have to save.\"\n\nDemocrats often accuse Republicans of deliberately making it hard to vote in order to keep minorities, immigrants, young people and other groups from the polls. And Republicans often say they oppose voting reforms because of concerns of voter fraud - which is extremely rare - or concerns over having the federal government run elections. But Trump's remarks reveal how at least some Republicans have long understood voting barriers to be a necessary part of their political self-preservation.\n\n\"I don't want everybody to vote,\" Paul Weyrich, an influential conservative activist, said in 1980. \"As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\"\n\nTrump's Monday comments showed he saw voter suppression as part of his re-election strategy, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) said in a statement Monday. \"Ensuring that Americans can vote during the Covid-19 crisis is fundamental to maintaining our democracy. It is shocking that Trump is essentially admitting that when the American people vote, Republican lose,\" said Xochitl Hinojosa, a DNC spokeswoman. \"Trump knows that suppressing the vote is the only way he and Republicans win in November.\"\n\nShortly after he was elected, Trump falsely claimed he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes. There is no credible evidence to support the claim. In December, a Trump campaign aide was recorded saying: \"Traditionally it's always been Republicans suppressing votes in places.\" The aide later told the Associated Press he was saying that Republicans have traditionally been accused of voter suppression.\n\nThe $400m that Congress allocated so far is just a small fraction of what the Brennan Center for Justice estimated election officials need to run elections in November if coronavirus still lingers. Officials need that money to pay for postage, personnel and equipment to process an influx of mail-in ballots.\n\nThe urgency of getting election officials those resources should not be lost in the political fighting, said Myrna Perez, director of the Brennan Center's voting rights and elections program.\n\n\"What cannot be lost in all the back and forth among politicians is that election administrators at the state and local level need substantial resources now to ensure that the elections in November go off smoothly and safely,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

"body": "The company has seen a 535% rise in daily traffic in the past month, but security researchers say the app is a 'privacy disaster'\n\nAs coronavirus lockdowns have moved many in-person activities online, the use of video conferencing platform Zoom has quickly escalated. So, too, have concerns about its security.\n\nIn the last month, there was a 535% rise in daily traffic to the Zoom.us download page, according to an analysis from web analytics firm SimilarWeb. Its app for iPhone has been the most downloaded app in the country for weeks, according to the mobile app market research firm Sensor Tower. Even politicians and other high-profile figures, including the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the former US federal reserve chair Alan Greenspan, use it for conferencing as they work from home.\n\nBut security researchers have called Zoom \"a privacy disaster\" and \"fundamentally corrupt\" as allegations of the company mishandling user data snowball.\n\nOn Monday, New York's attorney general, Letitia James, sent a letter to the company asking it to outline the measures it has taken to address security concerns and accommodate the rise in usership.\n\nIn the letter, James said Zoom has been slow to address security vulnerabilities \"that could enable malicious third parties to, among other things, gain surreptitious access to consumer webcams\". A spokesman from Zoom told the Guardian it is planning to send James the requested information and comply with the request.\n\n\"Zoom takes its users' privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously,\" the spokesman said. \"During the Covid-19 pandemic, we are working around the clock to ensure that hospitals, universities, schools and other businesses across the world can stay connected and operational.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about the challenges with Zoom:\n\n'Zoom bombing' on the rise\n\nOn 30 March, the FBI announced it is investigating increased cases of video hijacking, also known as \"Zoom-bombing\", in which hackers infiltrate the video meetings, often shouting racial slurs or threats.\n\nZoom meetings can be accessed by a short number-based URL, which can easily be generated and guessed by hackers, a January report from the security firm Checkpoint found. Zoom has released guidelines in recent days about how to prevent unwanted guests from crashing video meetings.\n\nNo end-to-end encryption\n\nZoom has falsely advertised itself as using end-to-end encryption, a system that secures communication so that it can only be read by the users involved, a report from the Intercept found. \"Currently, it is not possible to enable E2E encryption for Zoom video meetings,\" Zoom told the Intercept.\n\nSecurity flaws\n\nA number of security flaws affecting Zoom have been reported in the past and as recently as this week. In 2009, it was revealed Zoom quietly installed a hidden web server on user devices that could allow the user to be added to a call without their permission.\n\nAnother bug discovered this week would enable hackers to take over a Zoom user's Mac, including tapping into the webcam and hacking the microphone. The number of security issues with Zoom in the past make it as bad as malicious software, said Arvind Narayanan an associate computer science professor at Princeton University.\n\n\"Let's make this simple,\" he said. \"Zoom is malware.\"\n\nIn-app surveillance measures\n\nZoom has been criticized for its \"attention tracking\" feature, which allows a host to see if a user clicks away from a Zoom window for 30 seconds or more.\n\nThis feature would allow employers to check if employees are really tuned into a work meeting or if students are really watching a classroom presentation remotely.\n\nSelling user data\n\nA report from Motherboard found Zoom sends data from users of its iOS app to Facebook for advertising purposes, even if the user does not have a Facebook account.\n\nZoom changed some of its policies in response. But the story was cited in a lawsuit filed in a federal court in California this week, accusing Zoom of failing to \"properly safeguard the personal information of the increasing millions of users\" on its platform.\n\nThis privacy flaw was also mentioned in the letter from James, which noted such privacy violations could be of particular concern as schools migrate to Zoom for class.\n\n\"While Zoom has remediated specific reported security vulnerabilities, we would like to understand whether Zoom has undertaken a broader review of its security practices,\" the letter said.", "source":

"Mexico's president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has sparked perplexity and scorn by visiting the home town of his country's most infamous drug lord and greeting the gangster's mother - despite a plea from his own government for Mexicans to stay indoors.\n\nMexico's deputy health minister on Saturday implored the country's 130 million citizens not to leave home in an \"urgent\" bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.\n\nBut less than 24 hours later L\u00f3pez Obrador ignored that advice and journeyed to Badiraguato - the birthplace and former stomping ground of Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, the world-famous narco boss who was last year jailed for life in the United States.\n\nLocated in the northern state of Sinaloa, Badiraguato is part of Mexico's so-called Golden Triangle, a poor and mountainous marijuana- and poppy-growing region long at the heart of the country's drug trade.\n\nThe controversy did not end there.\n\nVideo footage that went viral on Sunday evening showed the leftwing populist - who most call Amlo - shaking the hand of El Chapo's elderly mother, Mar\u00eda Consuelo Loera P\u00e9rez, as she sat in her car.\n\n\"Don't get out,\" Amlo can be heard telling the 91-year-old woman, before adding: \"I got your letter.\"\n\nAlso visible in the footage, putting his arm around Mexico's president, is a man identified as Jos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Meza, a Guzm\u00e1n family representative.\n\nAmlo has been widely criticised for his lackadaisical response to coronavirus, and his outing sparked further anger - with many noting that the visit had coincided with the 30th birthday of El Chapo's son, Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez.\n\nLast October heavily armed cartel gunmen brought Sinaloa's capital, Culiac\u00e1n, to a standstill in order to secure Ovidio's release after his home was raided by the army.\n\n\"It is very hard to understand what the president did today in Badiraguato,\" tweeted the Mexican journalist Pascal Beltr\u00e1n del R\u00edo.\n\nAmlo had \"failed to keep a healthy distance - in more than one sense\", he added.\n\nMarko Cort\u00e9s, an opposition leader from the National Action party (Pan), described the meeting as an insult to victims of Mexico's cartels and members of the armed forces who were risking their lives to tackle them. \"You must urgently explain your connection to this family,\" Cort\u00e9s tweeted.\n\nIoan Grillo, the author of the book El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency, said Amlo's visit was a mistake.\n\n\"He needs to be 100% leading the country in the fight against the pandemic. This is a terrible way to distract from it ... none of this helps Amlo or the country,\" Grillo added.\n\nAmlo, who was making his second visit to Badiraguato since taking power in 2018, offered no immediate explanation for the encounter with El Chapo's mother but has previously pledged to lift the long-neglected drug-producing region out of poverty.\n\nWriting on Twitter, Mexico's leader said he had come to the Sierra Madre region \"to connect with marginalized communities and villages\". \"Nothing and no one will stop us,\" Amlo added.\n\nAs he arrived back in Mexico City on Sunday, Amlo was surrounded by journalists demanding to know why he had greeted El Chapo's mother and what her letter had said.\n\n\"Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,\" Amlo replied. \"At this late hour, I'm on interview strike.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_phillips@theguardian.com", "name": "Tom Phillips", "type":

good job'", "body": "President extends social distancing rules to 30 April, saying open for Easter plans were only 'aspirational'\n\nDonald Trump has extended America's national shutdown for a month, bowing to public health experts, and scientific reality, and warning that the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is yet to come.\n\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden, the US president claimed that, if his administration keeps the death toll to 100,000, it will have done \"a very good job\" - a startling shift from his optimistic predictions of a few days ago when he said he hoped to restart the economy by Easter.\n\nTrump also undermined his plea for unity by uttering falsehoods, verbally abusing reporters and making incendiary allegations that implied health care workers were stealing masks, without providing evidence.\n\nThe extended deadline marked a humiliating retreat for the president who, having squandered six precious weeks at the start of the pandemic, more recently complained that the cure is worse than the problem and floated Easter Sunday as a \"beautiful timeline\" for reopening big swathes of the country.\n\nOn Sunday he claimed this had only been \"aspirational\" as his advisers urged him not to move too hastily. He announced the initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government, which was due to expire on Monday, would be extended to 30 April, and said he hoped normality might return by 1 June.\n\nThe guidelines recommend against big group gatherings and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay at home. People were also urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants, bars, non-essential travel and shopping trips.\n\n\"The modelling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks,\" Trump told reporters, with the toll already at more than 2,400. \"Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all.\"\n\nHe added: \"We can expect by June 1st we will be well on our way to recovery.\"\n\nThe shift came as the full horror of the pandemic appeared to dawn on a president who long downplayed it. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, said the US could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections. Fauci praised the extension as a \"wise and prudent\" decision.\n\nTrump cited projection models that said potentially 2.2 million people or more could have died had the country tried to \"wing it\" and not put social distancing measures in place. \"I kept asking and we did models,\" he said. \"These are 2.2 million people would have died.\n\n\"And so, if we could hold that down, as we're saying, to 100,000 - it's a horrible number, maybe even less, but to 100,000, so we have between 100 [thousand] and 200,000 - we altogether have done a very good job.\"\n\nTrump also appeared to have been rattled by scenes at Elmhurst Hospital where he grew up in Queens, New York. \"I've been watching that for the last week on television,\" he said. \"Body bags all over, in hallways.\"\n\n\"I've been watching them bring in trailer trucks, freezer trucks, they're freezer trucks, because they can't handle the bodies, there are so many of them. This is essentially in my community, in Queens; Queens, New York. I've seen things that I've never seen before.\"\n\nTrump had minimised the threat of the coronavirus for weeks and ignored the pleas of his health secretary to investing in testing kits and breathing apparatus. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told CNN's State of the Union this attitude had cost American lives. \"The president, his denial at the beginning, was deadly,\" she said.\n\nTrump has long been criticised for refusing to own up to his own mistakes and shifting blame to others. In another lengthy, abrasive press conference, he pushed a conspiracy theory speculating that hospital staff may be stealing N95 masks and selling them on the black market.\n\nThe current demand does not square with what hospitals usually use, he told reporters. \"It's a New York hospital, very - it's packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20 [thousand masks per week] to 300,000? Ten [thousand] to 20,000 masks, to 300,000 - even though this is different? Something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Are they going out the back door?\"\n\nHe added: \"How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So somebody should probably look into that, because I just don't see from a practical standpoint how that's possible to go from that to that.\"\n\nWhen a reporter asked the president to clarify, he asked for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio to investigate, adding: \"I don't think it's hoarding. I think it's maybe worse than hoarding.\"\n\nThe comments provoked widespread outrage. Joe Kennedy III, a Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, tweeted: \"We need supplies. We need masks. Our frontlines are suffering. Suggesting otherwise is disgusting.\"\n\nJoe Biden, the front runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: \"This is ridiculous and completely false. Today's conspiracy mongering from our president is among the most reckless and ignorant moves he has made during this crisis, and there have been many. Lives hang in the balance.\"\n\nAs in previous briefings all week, the president picked fights with individual reporters including Yamiche Alcindor, a reporter at PBS NewsHour who is a woman of colour.\n\nWhen Alcindor questioned him about comments he made during an interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity that suggested state governors were making exaggerated demands, Trump retorted: \"Why don't you act in a little more positive? ... It's always get ya, get ya, get ya. You know what? That's why nobody trusts the media anymore.\"\n\nHe added: \"Look, let me tell you something, be nice. Don't be threatening. Be nice.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_smith@theguardian.com", "name": "David Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

"Hancock said that 8% of NHS frontline staff were currently off work self-isolating amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nWithin that group, 5.7% of doctors are currently off work. \"Those figures are stable but we want to get them down obviously, and one of the ways we do that is make sure testing goes up,\" said Hancock.\n\nHealth secretary Matt Hancock is first up on Sophy Ridge on Sky News this morning, emphasising that people should not flout the coronavirus lockdown rules despite the warm weather.\n\n\"Sunbathing is against the rules that have been set out for important public health reasons,\" he said, adding that it was \"unbelievable frankly to see some people are not following that advice\".\n\n\"I say this to the very small minority of people who are choosing to flout the guidance you are putting other's lives at risk and you are putting yourself in harm's way.\"\n\nHe added that the \"vast majority of the public\" were following guidance to stay at home unless they are going to buy essentials such as food or medicine, seeking medical care, going to work, or exercising.\n\nHancock's call for the public to adhere to public health guidance comes as Lambeth Council closed Brockwell Park in south-west London on Saturday, after it claimed that more than 3,000 people had spent the day in the park, sunbathing or hanging out in large groups.\n\nI'm Amy Walker,

While this is a difficult time for everyone, it has been particularly tough on the famous. They have been upstaged by a virus. No one cares what they are wearing or who they are snogging any more; the world's attention has been diverted by a headline-hogging pandemic. It seems as if some celebrities are starting to grapple with the realisation that they are not quite as important or beloved as they thought they were.\n\nGal Gadot was the first victim of the great celebrity backlash of 2020. \"We're all in this together,\" the Wonder Woman star assured us in a video on Instagram a couple of weeks ago, before launching into a star-studded rendition of John Lennon's Imagine. Can you imagine how little self-awareness you must have to enlist a bunch of multimillionaires to sing about a world with \"no possessions\" while huge numbers of people are losing their jobs? The tone-deaf performance was swiftly savaged.\n\nOne would have thought the glitterati might have learned from the scathing reaction to Gadot's singalong. But no, the vapid messages of hope from celebs keep coming - as do the disgusted responses from the public. Madonna, for reasons only she knows, decided to preach to us from a bathtub full of rose petals. Covid-19 \"doesn't care about how rich you are\" she informed us. \"It's the great equaliser.\" It certainly brought people together in disdain for her out-of-touch antics.\n\nThen there is the billionaire David Geffen, who deleted Instagram after the incensed reaction to him posting pictures of his $590m (\u00a3480m) superyacht, on which he is self-isolating, with the caption \"hope everyone is staying safe\". Faring slightly better on the social media front is Ivanka Trump, who has not yet sequestered herself on a superyacht. Instead she is selflessly educating the great unwashed by posting a video of her kids cleaning their hands with $39 Aesop soap. A real woman of the people.\n\nNow it seems that Pharrell Williams has become the latest celebrity who is stuck inside but can't read the room. Last week, the musician called on his Twitter followers to donate to hospitals. A representative reply: \"You're worth over $150 million, donate your own money.\" Williams later clarified that he had already donated; nevertheless, it feels as if an awful lot of celebrities are more keen on soliciting money from us plebs than reaching into their own purses. The chef and TV star Bobby Flay, for example, who is said to be worth about $30 million, set up a GoFundMe campaign to help him pay his restaurant employees. That is capitalism for you: eventually you have to rely on other people's money.\n\nCelebrities being clueless is nothing new, but it feels as if there has never been such anger levelled at the jet set. Far from being a \"great equaliser\", coronavirus has made inequality impossible to ignore. That is not just wealth inequality, but inequality of access to healthcare. A new famous person seems to test positive for coronavirus every day while exhibiting mild symptoms at best. Meanwhile, our friends and family can be coughing up their lungs and still not get access to a test or a hospital bed.\n\nCelebrity culture and capitalism are inextricably entwined. Both elevate the individual over the collective good. They rely on the lie of \"meritocracy\": work hard and you can achieve whatever you want. But it has become uncomfortably clear how little we value our hardest workers - the healthcare professionals, supermarket staff, bus drivers and delivery drivers who are keeping the world running while the rich run to their second homes. And it has never been so clear how little the people who earn the most contribute to society. \"We're all in this together,\" the rich and famous keep telling us. Sorry, but it is obvious that we are not.\n\nArwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

being gagged from speaking out about widespread shortages of personal protective equipment that they fear could risk their lives from the coronavirus, frontline medics claim.\n\nDoctors and nurses are being warned by hospitals and other NHS bodies not to raise their concerns publicly, according to a dossier of evidence collated by the Doctors' Association UK (DAUK).\n\nTactics being used to deter staff from voicing their unease include \"threatening\" emails, the possibility of disciplinary action and in two cases being sent home from work. Some doctors have been given a ticking-off after managers were irritated by material they had posted on social media.\n\n\"Doctors across the frontlines are extremely concerned about the lack of personal protective equipment [PPE]. Many have told us they have tried to raise concerns through the proper channels but have been warned against taking these concerns further,\" said Dr Samantha Batt Rawden, DAUK's president.\n\n\"At this time when we desperately need every single doctor on the frontline, some have had their careers threatened, and at least two doctors have been sent home from work. This is unacceptable. Doctors have a moral duty to make their concerns regarding COVID-19 public if these cannot be resolved locally,\" she added.\n\nThe NHS organisations involved appear to want to stop staff from highlighting the lack of facemasks, goggles, visors and gowns that has created huge alarm and fear at the frontline. Many health professionals are worried that they may contract the virus during the course of their work, especially if their PPE is inadequate, and pass it on to patients or their families.\n\nIn recent weeks staff have posted photographs on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram of makeshift PPE they have put together using materials such as bin bags.\n\nFor example, A&E staff at Southend hospital in Essex have been warned that they could face disciplinary action if they raise the issue of PPE publicly.\n\nIn a memo on 26 March they were told: \"The posting of inappropriate social media commentary or the posting of photographs of staff in uniform who are not complying with IPC [infection prevention and control] standards and social distancing requirements is unacceptable. Such behaviour will be considered under the disciplinary policy.\n\n\"Now, perhaps more than ever, NHS staff are in the public eye and we have a responsibility to convey a professional image and to role model positive messages about social distancing. It would be very sad for moments of inappropriate or unprofessional behaviour to undermine the respect that we and our colleagues have from the public.\"\n\nMinisters and NHS bosses have organised thousands of deliveries of millions of pieces of PPE to hospitals, GP surgeries and other healthcare settings in England over the last 10 days, often with Army drivers bringing it. However, many staff still report ongoing shortages.\n\nIn other testimonies given to DAUK:\n\nAn intensive care doctor who voiced unease about facemasks was told by their hospital that \"if we hear of these concerns going outside these four walls your career and your position here will be untenable\".\n\nAnother intensive care specialist was called into a meeting with their bosses and disciplined after raising concerns.\n\nA GP working at Chase Farm hospital in London was sent home for voicing unease.\n\nA consultant paediatrician in Yorkshire was told in an email from their hospital that their social media output was being monitored and they should be careful.\n\nA GP who appealed to her community on social media for more supplies of PPE was then barred by her local NHS clinical commissioning group from speaking out. \"I was being warned I wasn't toeing the party line,\" she said.\n\nHelen O Connor, an organiser with the GMB union, said: \"Just as it seemed that the widespread and dangerous culture of gagging clauses and suppressing the voices of NHS workers might be coming to an end it is now intensifying.\n\n\"It is scandalous that hospital staff speaking out publicly face being sacked by ruthless NHS bosses who do not want failings in their leadership to be exposed. Suppression of information is not just a matter of democracy, it is now a major public health issue.\"\n\nNHS England pointed out that staff were continuing to speak to the media about Covid-19.\n\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"Once a major incidents occurs it is vital that the public receive fast, authoritative, open, clear and consistent information from their NHS, which is why, in line with longstanding emergency preparedness, resilience and response protocols, official communications are therefore always coordinated nationally.\n\n\"But staff continue to speak in a personal, trade union or professional body capacity, and it is self-evident from print and broadcast media coverage throughout this incident that staff are able and do in fact speak freely.\"\n\nThe British Medical Association, the main doctors' trade union, on Tuesday called on Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, to clarify what NHS staff who felt they did not have the right PPE for dealing with Covid-19 patients should do, given his comment that \"we cannot and should not ask healthcare workers to be on the frontline without appropriate protective equipment\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

"The utter chaos in America's response to the coronavirus pandemic - shortages of equipment to protect hospital workers, dwindling supplies of ventilators and critical medications, jaw-dropping confusion over how $2.2tn of aid in the recent coronavirus law will be distributed - was perhaps predictable in a nation that prides itself on competitive individualism and hates centralized power.\n\nBut it is also tailor-made for Donald Trump, who has spent a lifetime exploiting chaos for personal gain and blaming others for losses.\n\n\"I don't take responsibility\" for the slow rate of coronavirus testing in the US, he said.\n\nOn Friday, when asked if he could assure New Yorkers there would be enough ventilators next week when virus victims are expected to overwhelm city hospitals, he replied: \"No. They should have had more ventilators.\"\n\nTrump has told governors to find life-saving equipment on their own. He refuses to create a central bargaining agent, arguing the federal government is \"not a shipping clerk\". This has left states and cities bidding against each other, driving up prices.\n\nAndrew Cuomo, the New York governor, described how ventilators went from $25,000 to $45,000 \"because we bid $25,000. California says, 'I'll give you $30,000' and Illinois says, 'I'll give you $35,000' and Florida says 'I'll give you $40,000. And then, Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] gets involved and Fema starts bidding!\n\n\"And now Fema is bidding on top of the 50! So Fema is driving up the price. What sense does this make? We're literally bidding up the prices ourselves.\"\n\nNew York state is paying 20 cents for gloves that normally cost less than five cents, $7.50 for masks that normally go for 50 cents, $2,795 for infusion pumps that normally cost half that, $248,841 for a portable X-ray machine that typically sells for $30,000 to $80,000.\n\nWho's pocketing all this? An array of producers, importers, wholesalers and speculators. State laws against price gouging usually don't apply to government purchases.\n\nSome of it may be finding its way into this fall's election campaigns. The veteran Republican fundraiser Mike Gula and Republican political operative John Thomas just started a company selling coronavirus testing kits, personal protective equipment and other \"hard to find medical supplies to beat the outbreak\". They call themselves \"the largest global network of Covid-19 medical suppliers\".\n\nAsked how he'd found such equipment, Gula explained: \"I have relationships with a lot of people.\"\n\nThomas added: \"In politics - especially if you're at a high enough level - you are one phone call away from anybody in the world.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner - who's one phone call away from anyone - is running a \"shadow\" coronavirus task force that has been enlisting the private sector and overseeing the Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies, all out of public view.\n\n\"It's supposed to be our stockpile - it's not supposed to be state stockpiles,\" he said cryptically on Thursday.\n\nOh, and let's not forget the giant coronavirus bill Trump signed into law on 27 March, which created a $500bn fund that Trump and his treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, will distribute to the private sector. Most of it will backstop $4.5tn of subsidized loans (ie, bailout money) coming from the Fed, also distributed by the Treasury.\n\nIn a signing statement, Trump said he wouldn't agree to provisions in the bill for congressional oversight - meaning the wheeling-and-dealing will be in secret. When the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said she'd form a special select committee to watch how the money is spent, Trump accused her of \"conducting partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic\", adding: \"Here we go again ... It's witch hunt after witch hunt.\"\n\nIs there any doubt Trump will try to use this money, as well as his son-in-law's secretive dealings, to improve his odds of re-election?\n\nTrump was impeached a mere three and a half months ago on charges of abuse of power and obstructing investigations. Eight months ago, he phoned the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, seeking dirt on Joe Biden and threatening to hold up military aid to get it.\n\nIn June 2016, his son Donald Jr and Jared Kushner met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, after a Russian intermediary contacted Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would \"incriminate\" Hillary Clinton and be \"very useful to your father\", adding it was part of the Russian government's \"support\" for Trump.\n\nDonald Trump calls allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election a \"hoax\". He called his impeachment a \"hoax\". He initially called the coronavirus a \"hoax\".\n\nBut the real hoax is Trump's commitment to America. In reality he will do anything - anything - to hold on to power. In his mind, the coronavirus crisis is just another opportunity.\n\nRobert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

Jeremy Howard", "body": "You might walk into stores over the next few days and sicken dozens without knowing it. Some might die. Others will think they are dying before they recover.\n\nThat's the worry I have after reading a paper by Roman W\u00f6lfel and colleagues, published this week in Nature. It shows that people are most infectious in the first week after catching Covid-19. During that time they often show no or few symptoms.\n\nIn other words, Covid-19 moves like a silent assassin, with unwitting accomplices. Maybe you'll be one of them. The best way to ensure that you're not: wear a mask, and keep your distance from others. Don't wear an N95 respirator, the type in desperately short supply in hospitals, which is designed to keep doctors safe even when doing potentially dangerous medical procedures. But almost any kind of simple cloth covering over your mouth, such as a home-made mask, or even a bandanna, can stop the assassin in its tracks.\n\nThe W\u00f6lfel paper explains we must focus our efforts on stopping the spread of droplets. This is because the virus is primarily transmitted through tiny droplets of saliva ejected when we speak. You can't see them, but they are there. We also know that these droplets can go significantly further than the 6ft which is widely cited as a safe distance.\n\nResearch supported by Nobel prize-winning virologist Harold Varmus tells us that placing a layer of cloth in front of a person's face stops 99% of the droplets.\n\nSo, the science is clear. We do not know when we are sick. If we are sick, then when we speak we are projecting virus-laden droplets into the air. Wearing a simple cloth mask stops those droplets in their tracks. \"I'm not going to wear a surgical mask, because clinicians need those,\" said Dr Harvey Fineberg, chair of the National Academy of Sciences' standing committee on emerging infectious diseases and 21st century health threats. \"But I have a nice western-style bandanna I might wear. Or I have a balaclava. I have some pretty nice options.\" Fineberg led a committee of experts that has just released an expert consultation explaining that the virus can spread through talking, or even breathing.\n\nProf David Heymann CBE, a World Health Organization (WHO) adviser, said, \"I think that wearing a mask is equally effective or more effective than distancing.\"\n\nIn a paper published in Nature on Friday, a five-year study from the University of Hong Kong and the University of Maryland has found that a simple non-fitted mask blocked 100% of coronavirus droplets and aerosol. There's a vast chasm between what the science is showing and what many countries are doing. Masks may be the most important weapon in our war on the virus. But we're not even using it.\n\nWorse, key leaders continue to lessen its importance. The WHO recommends only wearing a mask if you are sick, or looking after somebody who is sick. With the new evidence, this makes no sense, if it ever did. Many people who are infected don't even know it. No wonder so many people are expressing such confusion about whether they should wear a mask.\n\nOther key data offers even more proof. Every country with enforced mask usage shows dramatically lower death rates compared with countries not using masks widely.\n\nWe can also see dramatic results when a country changes its policy on masks. Masks were hard to come by in South Korea until late February. Then the government stepped in and ensured a supply for every person in the country. Up until then, South Korea showed a similar-shaped exponential trajectory to Italy. After that point the exponential growth slowed, and today the number of active cases is decreasing. There is no economic lockdown there.\n\nStanford economic policy research experts state that \"the firm recommendation against masks in community settings appears incompatible with the available evidence\". Modeling by Yale researchers estimates that \"the benefits of each additional cloth mask worn by the public are conservatively in the $3,000-$6,000 range due to their impact in slowing the spread of the virus\". A cloth mask is basically free, since you can make one from old T-shirts or sheets. So the economic payoff is hard to question. What other investment pays off by over 1,000 to 1?\n\nOne huge challenge is that mask wearing only really pays off when most people do it. A Food and Drug Administration analysis of the flu estimates that if 50% of the population uses a mask, virus transmission is reduced by half. If 80% of the population uses a mask, the virus is \"essentially eliminated\".\n\nThat is why many jurisdictions have adopted laws that require mask use whenever in crowded places, such as public transport or shops. Some jurisdictions go further and require masks whenever out in public.\n\n\"Masks for All laws\" are now in place in Israel, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Mongolia and elsewhere, with more locations added every day. In the United States, where these laws are taking a long time to appear, some counties are going it alone, including Laredo in Texas and Riverside county in California, which have created their own local mask use laws. New York and Texas haven't yet used legislation, but their leadership have made a clear and direct plea to their communities to always wear a mask when in public.\n\nThese steps don't replace the need for social distancing and hand-washing. We need to use the entire set of tools we have in our toolbox to stop this killer.\n\nIf we can't rely on our governments to take this step, then we will have to take things into our own hands. We must rely on grassroots community efforts to get up to that magic 80% compliance number. We know this is possible, because the Czech Republic did it last month. In that country, a brilliantly effective social media and influencer campaign saw the country go from 0% mask use to nearly 100% mask use in three days. Then the government followed and made it the law.\n\nNow it's time for the rest of us to make this happen in our own communities.\n\nJeremy Howard is a distinguished research scientist at the University of San Francisco and the founder of Masks 4 All", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_V._Fineberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harvey V.

They likened Covid-19, which by that point had already extended its tentacles into at least 28 states in the US, to the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed 50 million people around the globe.\n\nOn the basis of their modelling, they calculated that if nothing was done to halt the spread of the disease, within weeks it would infect 81% of the US population. The virus would ravage the nation, eviscerate its health system and - here came the sting - put 2.2 million Americans into body bags.\n\nWe don't know at what point that bone-chilling figure was presented to Donald Trump. What we do know is that on the same day, 6 March, the president of the United States was taking a tour of the Atlanta offices of the federal disease control agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nHe was in ebullient mood. He had just heard on Fox News that the latest tally of coronavirus cases in the country was 240, with 11 deaths. Trump and his favourite TV channel were as one in their interpretation of those figures - things were going great, there was really nothing to worry about.\n\n\"It will end,\" he told the reporters trailing after him. \"People have to remain calm ... All I say is: 'Be calm.'\"\n\nThen a resourceful reporter asked him to set out the Trump administration's latest forecast for how coronavirus would progress in the country. He replied: \"We don't have a forecast, because we don't know.\"\n\n'One day - it's like a miracle - it will disappear'\n\nTrump's answer was one of the few candid moments over the past three months of his handling of the coronavirus crisis. It was true that they didn't know. That in a real sense they were walking blind.\n\nAlready by 6 March the absence of effective diagnostic testing - caused in part by the CDC's botched rollout of its own Covid-19 test - was severely hampering efforts to track the spread of the disease in the hope of containing it before it overwhelmed the country.\n\n\"Anybody that needs a test gets a test,\" Trump told the gaggle of reporters in Atlanta. \"They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.\"\n\nThe tests were not beautiful, they were critically flawed. Anybody who needed them was not getting them.\n\nWith virtually no testing available to inform public conversation, Trump was free to unleash his \"natural ability\" on the problem, which he did with abandon throughout the early weeks of the crisis.\n\nTrump took to describing himself as a \"wartime president\", with Covid-19 as the enemy. But his dogged pursuit of his own instincts, his preference for letting his \"hunches\" lead the nation into battle rather than deploying the weaponry of evidence and science, has been the hallmark of his response to the contagion so far.\n\nFrom the first confirmed US case in Washington state on 20 January to Trump's citing of Imperial's 2.2 million projected deaths which he did for the first time just this week, he has kept up a relentlessly upbeat facade, downplaying the severity of the threat largely for the benefit of the New York stock exchange.\n\n\"We have it totally under control,\" he said two days after that first confirmed case and a day before China cut off Wuhan, a city of 11 million.\n\n\"We only have five people, we pretty much shut it down coming from China,\" he said on 30 January, the day the World Health Organization declared a global emergency.\n\n\"It's going to disappear. One day - it's like a miracle - it will disappear,\" he said on 27 February, the day America mourned its first coronavirus death.\n\nTrump's 'hunches' versus science\n\nOn Tuesday he finally switched tone. The country was in for a \"very, very painful two weeks\", he said, and every American had to be prepared \"for the hard days that lie ahead\".\n\nBy then the bitter truth could no longer be avoided. With stringent social distancing, the Imperial's 2.2m body bags could be reduced, but by the reckoning even of Trump's own advisers between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans are still likely to die.\n\nTrump now has on his watch a public health disaster of devastating proportions. Some 245,573 cases have been confirmed across the states, twice the number in Italy, the second-highest nation in the Johns Hopkins league table.\n\nMore than 6,000 people have died and the curve is still rising exponentially. Covid-19 is overwhelming hospitals in New York, New Orleans, Detroit and is hurtling towards the Trump-supporting heartlands. The federal stockpile of essential medical equipment is nearly empty. Ventilators and protective gear for frontline medical staff are running fatally low. Doctors are improvising masks to save their own lives out of plastic bags and rubber bands. Even diagnostic testing, the most critical hope for getting on top of the disease, remains hard to get because of shortages in swabs and vials leaving emergency coordinators still - three months into the crisis - in the dark.\n\nIt is a catastrophe that many scientists and public health emergency experts believe could substantially have been averted, if only Trump had listened.\n\n\"This will be regarded as the worst public health disaster in America in a century,\" said Eric Topol, professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in San Diego. \"The root cause of the disaster was the lack of readiness to understand where, how and when the disease was spreading.\"\n\nJeremy Konyndyk, who led the US government's response to international disasters between 2013 and 2017, said that stark contrasts in outcomes between different countries in terms of illness and death have been determined not by Covid-19 itself, but by how seriously each government took the risk and how early they acted.\n\n\"On that score we failed badly,\" he said. \"You can have the best system in the world, but if you give the virus an eight-week head start it will eat you alive.\"\n\nFor Naomi Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard, the unfolding calamity is the fulfilment of her worst fears.\n\n\"When we first heard about coronavirus, I and several of my colleagues worried that Trump would not attend to scientific advice. This is a man who has exhibited a reckless disregard for scientific evidence over climate change; if he could do that, there was always the question of whether he would take seriously any science.\"\n\nOreskes sees Covid-19 as Trump's ultimate challenge. Would he put the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans first, or would he dig into the tried-and-tested Republican playbook of showing hostility to science and expertise, reining in government intervention and prioritizing the money markets?\n\n\"This was a test of whether Trump's government would act. What we've seen is that for the people in power in this country, ideology beats even an imminent threat.\"\n\n'As the president fiddles, people are dying'\n\nNancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, took the extraordinary step on Sunday of accusing Trump directly of \"costing American lives\". His lessening of the severity of the virus early on \"was deadly\", she told CNN, as will be the delays in delivering medical equipment to where it is needed.\n\n\"As the president fiddles, people are dying,\" she said.\n\nThat was a tough accusation, even by the standards of these hyper-partisan times. But a growing number of scientists and health emergency experts are tentatively drawing the same conclusion.\n\n\"We now know there will be well over 100,000 deaths,\" Topol said. \"A vast majority of those will have been unnecessarily lost because of the lack of preparedness of the United States. As a leader, Trump has to accept responsibility, which of course he won't.\"\n\nIt is not as though Trump wasn't warned. In the wake of the Ebola epidemic in 2014, the Obama administration was so fearful of the dangers of another epidemic that they put in place several innovations designed to prepare the nation for a pandemic.\n\nKonyndyk, who was central to the Ebola response, has watched aghast as every element of that effort has been unpicked or overlooked by the Trump administration. \"We set up a special team for pandemic preparedness at the national security council - they dismantled that. We left them a very detailed playbook of the initial steps for managing an event like this - they ignored that.\"\n\n'Scientists knew the risk - urgent action was needed'\n\nWhen coronavirus reared its ugly head, there was plenty of early warning. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, became aware of the outbreak of a virus in China as early as 3 January.\n\nBy 5 January scientists in Shanghai had obtained a complete viral genome from an infected patient and reported it immediately to GenBank, the genetic sequencing database of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). By early February, scientists were aware that Covid-19 was both easily transmitted between individuals and had a relatively high fatality rate, especially for older and vulnerable people.\n\n\"That was enough for scientists to know the virus had the potential to spread far and wide and that urgent action was needed,\" Konyndyk said.\n\nAt the same time, US intelligence agencies were passing on their own warnings to the White House. According to the Washington Post, Azar tried several times to sound the alarm but couldn't get an audience with Trump until 18 January, at which point all the president wanted to talk about was vaping.\n\nThe Post quoted an anonymous US official who said the system was \"blinking red\". The official said: \"Donald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were - they just couldn't get him to do anything about it.\"\n\nWith the full might of the US scientific community at his disposal, Trump appointed individuals not known for their prowess with pandemics in charge of the federal response. The coronavirus taskforce was to be led by the vice-president, Mike Pence, who has been widely criticized for his handling of a 2015 HIV outbreak when governor of Indiana.\n\nTrump is also increasingly relying on his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who made his first appearance at the taskforce briefing on Thursday. Politico has reported that Kushner, whose skill set is in real estate, has in turn reached out to his brother's father-in-law, who is at least a physician, for advice on fighting the pandemic.\n\n'Trump was out of step with all the experts'\n\nTrump's failure to heed the warnings and act quickly has set in train a domino effect that now imperils large swathes of the US. What began as an inability to get diagnostic testing going on a mass scale has developed into a sluggish mobilization of the federal government, a stuttering deployment of the Defense Production Act to enlist the firepower of corporations, and a stand-back, almost detached approach that has allowed state governors to take the lead in what Konyndyk called the birth of \"50-state anarchy\".\n\nOne of the few proactive measures taken by Trump was to impose a partial travel ban on China and Europe. Scientists told him the move would only delay the advance of Covid-19 in the US, it could never stop it. Again, he didn't listen.\n\n\"Trump thought in terms of a wall. Put a wall around China and the virus won't come to the US. He was out of step with all the experts around him,\" Topol said.\n\nAs a result, the US lost the early potential to contain the virus, either by locking down hotspots as China did with Hubei province or through aggressive testing to isolate those infected as South Korea has done.\n\nTomas Pueyo, a Stanford-trained consultant based in California, has laid out in sobering detail how quickly the disaster is laying waste to the US. His first exploration of the subject, a data-driven plea to take the disease seriously posted on Medium in early March, received 40m views.\n\nOn Wednesday he published his updated research. It shows America's curve of confirmed cases rising more steeply than that of any other country in the world.\n\nThree weeks ago, Pueyo reminds us, the US had fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases at a time when Trump was telling the world: \"No, I'm not concerned at all. No, I'm not. No, we've done a great job.\"\n\nNow it stands at almost a quarter of a million. \"This is what exponential growth looks like,\" he said.\n\nHaving hit the Democratic-controlled high-density urban centers first - San Francisco and Seattle, then New York and New Jersey, now Detroit - the virus is marching inexorably in the direction of the more rural southern and heartland states that happen to form the crucible of Trump's base.\n\nMany of those states followed the lead set by Trump and Fox News, remaining relaxed about the threat and moving astonishingly slowly to put physical distancing controls in place. Florida, under its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has echoed Trump's approach and only imposed a statewide stay-at-home order on Friday despite having the sixth-largest tally of confirmed cases in the country.\n\nGeorgia and Mississippi followed suit. Some Republican states including Oklahoma and South Carolina still have no statewide mandatory stay-at-home orders.\n\nPueyo points out that Republican voters are additionally vulnerable as they have a higher age profile than Democratic voters. Coronavirus makes no distinctions as to party, but it does prey on the elderly.\n\nSo it is one of the great paradoxes of Trump's pandemic that he may have put many of his own loyal supporters in mortal peril. As Konyndyk put it: \"Trump has endangered his own supporters by sending out a message in contradiction to the science, and they believed him.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

Lloyd Green", "body": "On Sunday, initially at least, there was no White House briefing on the president's public schedule. But the bad news kept coming. Coronavirus deaths continued to climb and reports of the heartland being unprepared for what may be on its horizon continued to ricochet around the media.\n\nIn the words of one administration insider, to the Guardian: \"The Trump organism is simply collapsing. He's killing his own supporters.\"\n\nMembers of the national guard, emergency workers, rank-and-file Americans: all are exposed. Yet Trump appears incapable of emoting anything that comes close to heart-felt concern. Or just providing straight answers.\n\nRather, he is acting like Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America: repeatedly letting governors know the burden of shoring up their sick, their doctors and their people falls on their shoulders first. The national government? It's the world's greatest backstop.\n\nRemember when the Republican party freaked out about Barack Obama and the US \"leading from behind\" abroad? Remember the howls that evoked from GOP leaders? Those days are gone. Welcome to what Martin O'Malley, a Democratic former governor of Maryland, calls the \"Darwinian approach to federalism\".\n\nTrump is telling NFL owners he wants the season to start on time. He is disregarding Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice on wearing facemasks in public. And he is touting untested coronavirus cures live on national TV.\n\nThink Trump University on steroids, only this time we all stand to be the victims.\n\nWhen Dr Anthony Fauci says there is no evidence to back up Trump's claims surrounding hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, pay attention. The fact Jared Kushner is on the case is hardly reassuring. He's the guy who thought firing James Comey was win-win politics and promised Middle East peace in our time.\n\nWhile all this is going on, the Wisconsin Republican party is giving America a taste of the campaign to come in the fall. Right now, the Badger State GOP is fighting in the US supreme court efforts to extend mail-in voting for this Tuesday's Democratic primary.\n\nIn other words, voters will be forced to choose between foregoing their rights and risking their lives. Democracy shouldn't work that way.\n\nBack in the day, Republicans looked upon absentee voting as a valuable adjunct, a key piece in the party's election day arsenal. Not anymore. Instead it is a dreaded foe, a fact readily admitted by Trump on Fox & Friends this week. If the US were to adopt mail-in voting, said the president, \"you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again\".\n\nFor good measure, Trump later declared from the White House: \"I think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.\"\n\nFor the record, Trump voted by mail in 2018. In March, the Palm Beach Post reported that he had requested a mail-in vote for the Florida Republican primary.\n\nThere is nothing like populism marinated in wholesale contempt for the populace. In case Trump and the Republicans forgot, \"We the People\" are the constitution's first three words.\n\nSadly, once again we are reminded that Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe's masterpiece, Gladiator, is the movie for this presidency and its tumultuous times. In one scene, a senator, Gracchus, attempts to confront Commodus, the emperor, about a plague spreading through Rome. The emperor declines, threatens the senator and muses about disbanding the Senate.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump forced the removal of Captain Brett Crozier from his command of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, for having the temerity to plead his sailors' case as more than 100 of them tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nIf you can leave your soldiers to suffer then no American is truly safe, no matter what Jeanine Pirro may say. Crozier left the ship to the cheers of the crew - then reportedly tested positive himself.\n\nHours after dismissing Crozier, Trump sacked Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community's inspector general, for simply doing his job. Trump's Ukraine call was never perfect, however many times he says it was.\n\nHail Caesar, indeed.\n\nWhether Trump wins reelection is an open question. For now, the economy is cratering and the coronavirus death toll has exploded. Not a promising combination. Herbert Hoover faced a depression, not a plague. Trump may contend with both.\n\nAccording to Chris Christie, a former New Jersey governor and the man who sent Charlie Kushner, Jared's father, to prison, November will be a referendum on Trump. Joe Biden is nearly irrelevant.\n\nFor the moment, Trump holds a commanding lead among Republicans. Seven months from now, we will learn if party loyalty is enough to secure a second term.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lloyd_green@theguardian.com", "name": "Lloyd Green", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Guard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trump University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

coronavirus adviser has warned again that there is no scientific evidence to support the use of an unproven anti-malaria drug the president has been pushing as a possible remedy for Covid-19.\n\nIn a rambling, hostile White House briefing on Saturday, Trump urged Americans worried about the virus to try hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, arthritis and lupus that has not been extensively tested for other conditions.\n\n\"Take it. What do you have to lose?\" the president said, suggesting that he might do so himself after asking \"my doctors\".\n\nBut on Sunday Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top doctor on infectious diseases and a key member of the White House task force, was adamant there was nothing to suggest the medicine had any benefit against coronavirus.\n\n\"In terms of science, I don't think we can definitively say it works,\" he told CBS's Face the Nation.\n\n\"The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect.\"\n\nDr James Phillips, professor of emergency medicine at George Washington University hospital, said Americans could be risking their health if they followed the president's advice to take a drug for a condition for which it had not been tested.\n\n\"We don't know enough to make medical recommendations,\" he told CNN's Reliable Sources.\n\n\"It's a dangerous message for someone without a medical license to get up there and tell people to try it. You need to listen to physicians, people who understand science, before you go willy-nilly into the medicine cabinet.\"\n\nFauci has been reluctant to directly criticise the president, with whom he speaks regularly, but has found himself repeatedly having to contradict the president over hydroxychloroquine, which has become a hobby horse at White House briefings.\n\nOn 21 March, the day after another nationally-televised Trump claim that the drug \"looked promising\", Fauci was asked directly if it could be used to treat Covid-19.\n\n\"The answer is no,\" he said.\n\nLast month, a man in Arizona died after he and his wife took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is also found in hydroxychloroquine.\n\n\"Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\" the man's wife told NBC.\n\nAccording to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, by Sunday lunchtime around 313,000 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US and around 8,500 people had died.\n\nFauci did concur with White House messaging that a grim period lies ahead in the battle against the virus, and that the US is \"struggling\" to control the pandemic.\n\n\"This is going to be a bad week, unfortunately,\" he said. \"We need to be prepared that even though it's clear mitigation is working, we're still going to see ... deaths.\"\n\nFauci said there were glimmers of hope, but not things were due to get worse first.\n\n\"We should hope that within a week, maybe a little bit more, we'll start to see a flattening out of the curve, and it coming down,\" he said. \"But the end result of that you don't see for days, if not weeks down the pipe. Things are going to get bad and we need to prepare for that, it is going to be shocking to some.\n\n\"I will not say we have it under control, that would be a false statement, we are struggling to get it under control.\"\n\nEven after the crisis was over, Fauci warned, the possibility of a resurgence remained.\n\n\"Unless we get this globally under control there's a very good chance it will assume a seasonal nature. It will unlikely be completely eradicated from the planet,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why we're pushing so hard on getting our preparedness much better, pushing on a vaccine and doing clinical trials for therapeutic interventions so that hopefully if we do see that resurgence we will have interventions we did not have at the beginning of the situation we're in right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_luscombe@theguardian.com", "name": "Richard Luscombe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

lot marked to distance residents from each other was best option after virus forced another shelter to close\n\nImages of homeless people sleeping in a converted parking lot in Las Vegas have sparked criticism, even as the city officials describe an \"emergency situation\" and say the solution was the best option after another shelter was forced to close amid the coronavirus crisis.\n\nOver the weekend, authorities in Las Vegas needed to find additional sleeping space for the city's sizable homeless population when a 500-bed overnight shelter closed after a client tested positive for the new coronavirus.\n\nOfficials turned a parking lot into a makeshift shelter, saying spaces for sleeping were drawn 6ft apart in observance of federal social distancing guidelines.\n\nMany white boxes were covered up with blue mats that could be more easily cleaned. But photos of the temporary shelter showing people sleeping close to each other on the ground, some within arm's reach, sparked backlash on social media.\n\nJace Radke, spokesperson for the city of Las Vegas, said the city and county had worked to open the temporary shelter after Catholic Charities closed and the city's other shelter, Courtyard Homeless Resource Center, was nearly filled to capacity.\n\nOfficials set up the new shelter in the parking lot of the Cashman Center, which most recently has hosted soccer games. A city official said the inside of the Cashman Center could not be used as shelter because it was reserved for overflow hospital space.\n\nHomelessness is a continuing crisis in southern Nevada, with at least 6,500 people camped on streets or in storm drains at any given time.\n\nOn Saturday, roughly a dozen medical and physician assistant students from Touro University were on hand to help officials set up the shelter.\n\nRadke said Catholic Charities planned to reopen within the week and that medical staff would be available near the Cashman Center to screen people for symptoms and get them medical help if they showed signs of being infected.\n\nThe blue mats laid down for people to sleep are easier to clean than the 24,000-sq-ft carpet squares volunteers had first used at the parking lot, which cannot be power washed.\n\nBut many on Twitter have criticized the move, pointing to photos of people who appear to be sleeping on the ground or on unseen patches of carpet.\n\n\"After criminalizing homelessness this year, Las Vegas is now packing people into concrete grids out of sight,\" tweeted Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former presidential hopeful and mayor of San Antonio, who served as the secretary of housing under Barack Obama.\n\n\"There are 150K hotel rooms in Vegas going unused right now. How about public-private cooperation (resources) to temporarily house them there? And fund permanent housing!\"\n\nRadke said he could not speak to specific photos but said they may have been taken of the sections of parking lot that were not yet covered when officials ran out of mats.\n\n\"Look, this is an emergency situation. People are always going to criticize. But the city and county are working to ensure people can get the resources they need,\" he said, adding that the state's stay-at-home order \"is easier said than done for people who are homeless\".\n\nDespite the backlash, the shelter was a welcome sight to Denise Lankford, who is unhoused.\n\n\"I'm about to cry,\" Lankford told the CNN affiliate KLAS. \"This right here is helping us feel secure, feel safe. Other places, you don't feel safe.\"\n\nBefore coronavirus landed in the global spotlight, the city had begun cracking down on people living outdoors. In November, the city council approved a law that made sitting, resting or \"lodging\" on sidewalks a misdemeanor punishable with up to six months in jail or fines of up to $1,000 in most neighborhoods.\n\nWhile the mayor, Carolyn Goodman, said the city's \"entire effort is humanitarian and compassionate\", housing advocates worried that the \"no lodging\" convictions would haunt people for the rest of their lives.\n\nHomelessness is a widespread problem across the western US, particularly in California, where more than 40,000 people live in shelters on a given night.\n\nAdvocates and shelter residents have warned that unsanitary and inhumane conditions raise significant concerns for the battle against the spread of the coronavirus.", "source": {"uri":

Lopez and Seth M Holmes", "body": "On the first day of California's \"shelter-in-place\" lockdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents raided immigrant communities in Los Angeles. Different from other raids, they carried N95 medical masks to protect themselves from Covid-19. Also different from previous raids, the Ice agents broke state regulations that ordered everyone to stay home except to do \"essential\" activities necessary to survive (eg buying food or medicine).\n\nThe protective masks Ice agents carried to raid communities in LA are the same personal protective equipment that made headlines in the last week due to extreme shortages endangering the lives of healthcare workers. These frontline health professionals care for patients without this basic protective equipment, forced to risk not only their own health but also the capacity of our health system in this critical pandemic. In fact, the surgeon general issued a statement requesting that all N95 masks be saved for doctors, nurses and other frontline health workers. In a time with severe shortages and orders to \"shelter in place\", the federal government chose to prioritize masks for Ice agents instead of necessary health personnel and, ultimately, chose raids over the health of our country.\n\nAccording to official Ice statements: \"Ice's highest priorities are to promote life-saving and public safety activities.\" However, these raids risk worsening the pandemic in the US.\n\nFirst, these raids sow distrust in public health recommendations and orders that are so important in this time of uncertainty. Second, these raids, far from essential for survival, run directly counter to public health recommendations (including from the federal government itself) and direct orders from local and state governments to practice physical distancing and to shelter in place. Specifically, such raids, lead to increased detention in overcrowded conditions ideal for the spread of the Covid-19 virus. In addition, any deportations resulting from such raids force unnecessary separation of families and movement of people. All of these actions aid the spread of this virus, threatening to overwhelm our health system and worsen the pandemic for everyone. Third, the use of protective medical masks for Ice officers worsens the shortage, putting doctors, nurses and other health professionals at risk.\n\nOn 20 March, Ice bid for 45,000 N95 protective medical masks to be delivered to all 26 enforcement and removal operations field offices. As public health experts whose research and writing focuses on immigration and health, we are appalled that the federal government risks worsening the pandemic, prioritizing Ice raids above the protection of doctors and nurses and the public health measures required to curb this pandemic.\n\nHospitals across the US are in dire need of N95 masks during the national shortage. Many doctors and nurses are now on home quarantine, unable to care for patients because they were unnecessarily exposed to the virus without protection. Some are even intubated on ventilators in intensive care units in critical condition themselves. The hashtag #GetMePPE trends on social media, asking politicians and concerned individuals to donate N95 masks to hospitals and clinics in order to avoid health system collapse without enough healthy frontline workers to care for patients. The federal government must prioritize protection for our health system and our society over raids that separate families in a time of shared crisis.\n\nThe Ice raids conducted by the federal government are putting our country at risk, worsening a critical shortage of medical supplies and leading to overcrowding and movement that facilitate the spread of Covid-19. At this historic moment, we must set our priorities straight. If we want to survive, we must stop Ice raids, detention and deportation. We must provide protective equipment to frontline workers in our health system. Our lives and the future of our society depend on it.\n\nMiriam Maga\u00f1a Lopez, MPH, is a first-generation immigrant and public health researcher and practitioner in the Berkeley Center for Social

"An Amazon worker who led a walkout at a New York City facility on Monday has been fired.\n\nChris Smalls, an assistant manager and organizer, learned of his termination as dozens of workers protested against the company's response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"It's a shame on them,\" Smalls told Vice News on Tuesday. \"To fire someone after five years for sticking up for people and trying to give them a voice.\"\n\nStrikers at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island demanded Amazon temporarily shut down the large facility for cleaning, after reports of multiple employees testing positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe respiratory disease has infected more than 164,000 Americans and killed more than 3,000, more than died in the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\nThe workers also demanded more protective gear and hazard pay as they work through the pandemic.\n\nAmazon confirmed that two workers at JFK8 tested positive and were quarantined. Workers allege that number is understated. In a call-and-response outside the fulfillment center, protesters reportedly chanted: \"How many cases we got? Ten!\"\n\nIn a statement, Amazon alleged Smalls \"had close contact with a diagnosed associate\" but did not comply when \"asked to remain home with pay for 14 days\".\n\n\"Despite that instruction to stay home with pay, he came onsite today, 30 March, further putting the teams at risk,\" the statement read. \"This is unacceptable and we have terminated his employment as a result of these multiple safety issues.\"\n\nAccording to the company's previous statements, the infected co-worker in question last reported for work on 11 March. Had Smalls been exposed that day, a 14-day mandatory quarantine would have made him eligible to return as soon as 25 March.\n\nSmalls said Amazon did not send him home until 28 March, three weeks after the exposure.\n\n\"No one else was put on quarantine,\" he said, even as the infected person worked alongside \"associates for 10-plus hours a week\".\n\n\"You put me on quarantine for coming into contact with somebody, but I was around [that person] for less than five minutes,\" he told Vice.\n\nAccording to Amazon, no one else was fired. Smalls said he was considering legal action, calling it \"a no-brainer\".\n\n\"Anyone can see this is a direct target,\" he said.\n\nSupporters of the protest excoriated the company for firing Smalls, which many said would intimidate workers. Some feared further retaliation.\n\nThe New York state attorney general, Letitia James, called Amazon's actions \"disgraceful\".\n\n\"I'm considering all legal options and calling on the [National Labor Relations Board] to investigate,\" she said in a tweet.\n\nAmazon has insisted it takes \"extreme measures\" for safety, including deep cleaning and procuring supplies. More than 800,000 workers were offered unlimited if unpaid leave if they felt uncomfortable working.\n\nThe company disputed nearly every detail related to the protest, from the number of participants to Smalls' job title. Organizers claimed more than 60 workers participated. Amazon said 15.\n\nThe company said no other participants in Monday's walkout would be subject to discipline or termination.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kenya_evelyn@theguardian.com", "name": "Kenya Evelyn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal protective equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Staten Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Staten Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letitia James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Labor Relations Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Government Agencies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Temporary_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Temporary Employment", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d743729de2bc96a5e1758906e54953cbb34dccec/0_31_5919_3551/master/5919.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=513ec57508e28fb07a4e49a3d7e901dd", "eventUri": "eng-5641864", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 10462}, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 10462, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6014215988", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-31", "time": "05:26:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-31T05:26:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-31T05:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis", "title": "'We can't go back to normal': how will the world emerge from the coronavirus crisis?", "body": "Everything feels new, unbelievable, overwhelming. At the same time, it feels as if we've walked into an old recurring dream. In a way, we have. We've seen it before, on TV and in blockbusters. We knew roughly what it would be like, and somehow this makes the encounter not less strange, but more so.\n\nEvery day brings news of developments that, as recently as February, would have felt impossible - the work of years, not mere days. We refresh the news not because of a civic sense that following the news is important, but because so much may have happened since the last refresh. These developments are coming so fast that it's hard to remember just how radical they are.\n\nCast your mind back a few weeks and imagine someone telling you the following: within a month, schools will be closed. Almost all public gatherings will be cancelled. Hundreds of millions of people around the world will be out of work. Governments will be throwing together some of the largest economic stimulus packages in history. In certain places, landlords will not be collecting rent, or banks collecting mortgage payments, and the homeless will be allowed to stay in hotels free of charge. Experiments will be underway in the direct government provision of basic income. Large swathes of the world will be collaborating - with various degrees of coercion and nudging - on a shared project of keeping at least two metres between each other whenever possible. Would you have believed what you were hearing?\n\nIt's not just the size and speed of what is happening that's dizzying. It's the fact that we have grown accustomed to hearing that democracies are incapable of making big moves like this quickly, or at all. But here we are. Any glance at history reveals that crises and disasters have continually set the stage for change, often for the better. The global flu epidemic of 1918 helped create national health services in many European countries. The twinned crises of the Great Depression and the second world war set the stage for the modern welfare state.\n\nBut crises can also send societies down darker paths. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, government surveillance of citizens exploded, while George W Bush launched new wars that stretched into indefinite occupations. (As I write this, the US military's current attempt at reducing its troop presence in Afghanistan, 19 years after the invasion, is being slowed by coronavirus-related complications.) Another recent crisis, the 2008 financial crash, was resolved in a way that meant banks and financial institutions were restored to pre-crash normality, at great public cost, while government spending on public services across the world was slashed.\n\nBecause crises shape history, there are hundreds of thinkers who have devoted their lives to studying how they unfold. This work - what we might call the field of \"crisis studies\" - charts how, whenever crisis visits a given community, the fundamental reality of that community is laid bare. Who has more and who has less. Where the power lies. What people treasure and what they fear. In such moments, whatever is broken in society gets revealed for just how broken it is, often in the form of haunting little images or stories. In recent weeks, the news has furnished us with countless examples. Airlines are flying large numbers of empty or near-empty flights for the sole purpose of protecting their slots on prime sky routes. There have been reports of French police fining homeless people for being outside during the lockdown. Prisoners in New York state are getting paid less than a dollar hour to bottle hand sanitiser that they themselves are not allowed to use (because it contains alcohol), in a prison where they are not given free soap, but must buy it in an on-site shop.\n\nBut disasters and emergencies do not just throw light on the world as it is. They also rip open the fabric of normality. Through the hole that opens up, we glimpse possibilities of other worlds. Some thinkers who study disasters focus more on all that might go wrong. Others are more optimistic, framing crises not just in terms of what is lost but also what might be gained. Every disaster is different, of course, and it's never just one or the other: loss and gain always coexist. Only in hindsight will the contours of the new world we're entering become clear.\n\nThe pessimistic view is that a crisis makes bad things worse. People who study disasters - and especially pandemics - know all too well their tendency to inflame xenophobia and racial scapegoating. When the Black Death came to Europe in the 14th century, cities and towns shut themselves to outsiders - and assaulted, banished and killed \"undesirable\" community members, most often Jews. In 1858, a mob in New York City broke into a quarantine hospital for immigrants on Staten Island, demanded that everyone leave and then burned the hospital down, fearful that it was putting people outside at risk of yellow fever. Wikipedia now has a page collating examples from more than 35 countries of \"xenophobia and racism related to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic\": they range from taunts to outright assault.\n\n\"In a totally rational world, you might assume that an international pandemic would lead to greater internationalism,\" says the historian Mike Davis, a renowned American chronicler of the disasters incubated by globalisation. For Davis, who wrote a book about the threat of avian flu in 2005, pandemics are a perfect example of the kind of crises to which global capitalism (with its constant movement of people and goods) is particularly vulnerable, but that the capitalist mindset (with its inability to think in terms beyond profit) cannot address. \"In a rational world, we would be ramping up production of basic essential supplies - test kits, masks, respirators - not only for our own use, but for poorer countries, too. Because it's all one battle. But it's not necessarily a rational world. So there could be a lot of demonisation and calls for isolation. Which will mean more deaths and more suffering worldwide.\"\n\nIn the US, President Trump has tried hard to brand the new coronavirus as inherently \"Chinese\", and to use the pandemic as a pretext for tightening borders and accepting fewer asylum seekers. Republican officials, thinktanks and media outlets have claimed or implied that Covid-19 is a man-made Chinese bioweapon. Some Chinese officials, in turn, have pushed the conspiracy theory that the outbreak came to China by way of American soldiers. In Europe, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, recently announced: \"We are fighting a two-front war: one front is called migration, and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two, as both spread with movement.\"\n\nWhen you're fighting a war, you want to know as much about the enemy as possible. But it's easy, in the rush of crisis, to put in place surveillance tools without thinking about the long-term harm they might do. The scholar Shoshana Zuboff, the author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, reminded me that, prior to 9/11, the US government had been in the process of developing serious regulations designed to give web users real choice about how their personal information was and wasn't used. \"In the course of a few days,\" Zuboff says, \"the concern shifted from 'How do we regulate these companies that are violating privacy norms and rights' to 'How do we nurture and protect these companies so they can collect data for us?'\"\n\nFor governments looking to monitor their citizens even more closely, and companies looking to get rich by doing the same, it would be hard to imagine a more perfect crisis than a global pandemic. In China today, drones search for people without facemasks; when they are found, the drones' built-in speakers broadcast scoldings from police. Germany, Austria, Italy and Belgium are all using data - anonymised, for now - from major telecommunications companies to track people's movement. In Israel, the national security agency is now allowed to access infected individual's phone records. South Korea sends texts to the public identifying potentially infected individuals and sharing information about where they've been.\n\nNot all surveillance is inherently malign, and new tech tools very well might end up playing a role in fighting the virus, but Zuboff worries that these emergency measures will become permanent, so enmeshed in daily life that we forget their original purpose. Lockdowns have made many of us, sitting at home glued to our computers and phones, more dependent than ever on big tech companies. Many of these same companies are actively pitching themselves to government as a vital part of the solution. It is worth asking what they stand to gain. \"People have a hard time remembering privacy rights when they're trying to deal with something like a pandemic,\" says Vasuki Shastry, a Chatham House fellow who studies the interplay of technology and democracy. \"Once a system gets scaled up, it can be very difficult to scale it back down. And then maybe it takes on other uses.\"\n\nThe prime ministers of both Israel and Hungary have effectively been given the power to rule by decree, without interference from courts or legislature. The UK's recently rolled-out coronavirus bill gives police and immigration officers the authority - in place for the next two years - to arrest and detain people suspected of carrying the virus, so that they can be tested. The US Department of Justice has, since the outbreak began, filed a request with Congress for a new rule that would allow judges to suspend courtroom proceedings in emergencies, creating the possibility of people being jailed without ever being able to formally object. \"Those of us who follow the police know how this goes,\" said Kevin Blowe of Netpol, a UK group focused on protest rights. \"These powers get put in place, and it sounds reasonable enough at the time - and then very quickly they're applied for other purposes that have nothing to do with democracy and nothing to do with public safety.\"\n\nIn a 2008 report on the legal aspects of pandemic response, prompted by the increase in pandemic flu outbreaks, a team of historians and medical ethicists assembled by the American Civil Liberties Union bemoaned a common tendency - resurgent, in their view, since 9/11 - for government to address public health problems using mindsets more appropriate to tracking down criminals. This suspicious mindset, they argued, ended up most affecting racial minorities and the poor. Tactics like these can make fighting the disease harder, by driving a hard wedge of distrust between government and citizens. As the report put it: \"People, rather than the disease, become the enemy.\"\n\nThere's another school of thought that looks at crisis and sees glimmers of possibility. For thinkers in this camp, the example of the 2008 financial crash looms large. But where, from their view, 2008 led to defeat - with the broad public giving up a great deal while a small few profited - Covid-19 might open the door to political progress.\n\n\"I think we're just so different to how we were before we saw the aftermath of the 2008 crash,\" said the American writer Rebecca Solnit, one of today's most eloquent investigators of crises and their implications. \"Ideas that used to be seen as leftwing seem more reasonable to more people. There's room for change that there wasn't beforehand. It's an opening.\"\n\nThe argument, in its simplest form, is this: Covid-19 has revealed the political status quo to be broken. Long before anyone had heard of the new coronavirus, people died of diseases we knew how to prevent and treat. People lived precarious lives in societies awash with wealth. Experts told us about catastrophic threats on the horizon, including pandemics, and we did next to nothing to prepare for them. At the same time, the drastic measures governments have taken in recent weeks testify to just how much power the state does have - the extent of what government can accomplish (and quickly!) when it realises it must act boldly or risk being seen as fundamentally illegitimate. As Pankaj Mishra recently wrote: \"It has taken a disaster for the state to assume its original responsibility to protect citizens.\"\n\nFor years, in mainstream politics the conventional line - on everything from healthcare to basic living expenses such as housing - has been that even if the world has its problems, expansive government intervention is not a feasible solution. Instead, we have been told that what works best are \"marketplace\" solutions, which give large roles to corporations motivated not by outdated notions like \"the public good\" but by a desire to make a profit. But then the virus started spreading, governments spent trillions in days - even going so far as to write cheques directly to citizens - and suddenly the question of what was feasible felt different.\n\nFrom this perspective, the task today is not to fight the virus in order to return to business as usual, because business as usual was already a disaster. The goal, instead, is to fight the virus - and in doing so transform business as usual into something more humane and secure.\n\nIn her 2009 book, A Paradise Built in Hell, Solnit used case studies of disasters - including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terror attacks and Hurricane Katrina - to argue that emergencies aren't just moments when bad things get worse, or when people inevitably become more scared, suspicious and self-centred. Instead she foregrounded the ways in which disasters opened up human reserves of improvisation, solidarity and resolve, pockets of purpose and joy, even in the midst of loss and pain. The book was not a call to celebrate disaster - but to pay attention to the possibilities it might contain, and how it might shake us loose from old ways. In Solnit's telling, \"official\" disaster responses had a tendency to muck things up by treating people as part of the problem to be managed, not an invaluable part of the solution.\n\nSometimes this mismanagement is a result of mere incompetence - other times it is more sinister. In her 2007 book, The Shock Doctrine, the Canadian writer Naomi Klein laid out a dark account of crisis politics. In Klein's view, there is always Disaster 1 - the earthquake, the storm, the military conflict, the economic slump - and Disaster 2 - the bad things that people with power subsequently get up to, such as ramming through extreme economic reforms or gobbling up post-crisis opportunities for self-enrichment, while the rest of us are too dazed to notice. (In fact, Klein argued, these people sometimes engineer Disaster 1 to get the process started.)\n\nUnlike Solnit's book, The Shock Doctrine doesn't have much to say about the resilience of everyday people when everything goes horribly wrong. (Indeed, Solnit directly criticised Klein for this omission.) But the two books fit together like puzzle pieces. Both address crisis not in terms of what inevitably - or \"naturally\" - happens as they unfold, but in terms of choices that people make along the way. And both were well-timed to contribute to the political conversations taking shape in the rubble of the financial crash.\n\nIn 2008, days after Barack Obama's election, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, famously said: \"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\" Today's leftists, for whom Obama mostly represents disappointment, are prone to agree. They feel that, in the wake of recent crises, they lost, and now is the time to make amends. If, facing a pandemic, we can change this much in a few weeks, then how much might we change in a year?\n\nFor anyone making this argument, the contrast between 2008 and the present crisis is striking. Compared to the opaque financial crisis, with its credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations, the coronavirus is relatively easy to understand. It is a dozen crises tangled into one, and they're all unfolding immediately, in ways that cannot be missed. Politicians are getting infected. Wealthy celebrities are getting infected. Your friends and relatives are getting infected. We may not quite all be \"in it together\" - as always, the poor are hit worse - but there is more truth to the idea than there ever was in the wake of 2008.\n\nIn this, the optimists believe, there is hope that we might begin to see the world differently. Maybe we can view our problems as shared, and society as more than just a mass of individuals competing against each other for wealth and standing. Maybe, in short, we can understand that the logic of the market should not dominate as many spheres of human existence as we currently allow it to.\n\n\"More people are in a position to connect the dots,\" Klein said. \"It has to do with people's experiences; for people of a certain age, their only experience of capitalism has been one of crisis. And they want things to be different.\"\n\nThat screaming buzzsaw noise in the background of this conversation is the sound of the climate crisis. If 2008 is the disaster that Klein and like-minded thinkers want to avoid repeating, climate change is the much bigger disaster they see coming - that they know is already here - and that they want to fight off. Indeed, in the years since publishing The Shock Doctrine, Klein has made climate change her central focus, framing it as the paradigmatic emergency that must be wrenched from the clutches of fossil-fuel profiteers and their enablers in government.\n\nAlthough Covid-19 is likely the biggest global crisis since the second world war, it is still dwarfed in the long term by climate change. Yet the two problems have suggestive similarities. Both will require unusual levels of global cooperation. Both demand changes in behaviour today in the name of reducing suffering tomorrow. Both problems were long predicted with great certainty by scientists, and have been neglected by governments unable to see beyond the next fiscal quarter's growth statistics. Accordingly, both will require governments to take drastic action and banish the logic of the marketplace from certain realms of human activity, while simultaneously embracing public investment. In other words, to think of this new level of state intervention as a temporary requirement is to ensure that we continue barrelling down the path to climate disaster.\n\n\"We've been trying for years to get people out of normal mode and into emergency mode,\" said Margaret Klein Salamon, a former psychologist who now heads the advocacy group The Climate Mobilization. \"What is possible politically is fundamentally different when lots of people get into emergency mode - when they fundamentally accept that there's danger, and that if we want to be safe we need to do everything we can. And it's been interesting to see that theory validated by the response to the coronavirus. Now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate, where the dangers are orders of magnitude greater. We can't think we're going to go 'back to normal', because things weren't normal.\"\n\nThe analogy between the two crises only goes so far. There is no getting around the fact that the impacts of climate change are more gradual than those of Covid-19. Most people do not feel they or their loved ones could die from the climate crisis this month, and so emergency mode is harder to activate and sustain. As Salamon pointed out to me, if we truly accepted we were in a climate emergency, then every day the news would lead with updates about which countries were reducing their emissions the fastest, and people would be clamouring to make sure their leaders were adopting the policies that worked.\n\nBut it is not unimaginable that the experience of Covid-19 could help us understand climate change differently. As the virus has reduced industrial activity and road traffic, air pollution has plummeted. In early March, the Stanford University scientist Marshall Burke used pollution data from four Chinese cities to measure changes in the level of PM2.5, a particularly harmful pollutant that attacks the heart and lungs. He estimated that, in China alone, emission reductions since the start of the pandemic had in effect saved the lives of at least 1,400 children under five and 51,700 adults over 70. Meanwhile, people around the world have been sharing their own anecdotal findings online - stories of sweet-smelling breezes, expanded bike lanes and birdsong returning to neighbourhoods - in a way that almost resembles a digitally distributed Rebecca Solnit project: people catching glimpses, in the midst of a disaster, of a future they know they want and need.\n\nAlongside these hopeful signs, a far less heartening story is unfolding, which fits Klein's \"shock doctrine\" framework. Disaster 1: Covid-19. Disaster 2: the dismantling of even the meagre existing rules designed to protect the environment. On 26 March, following lobbying from the energy industry, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced that, in recognition of the pandemic's effects on the workforce, it will not punish violations of pollution regulations so long as companies can link those violations to the pandemic. China's environmental ministry has started waiving inspections that assess the environmental impact of industrial facilities. And advocacy groups funded by the plastics industry have launched a public relations blitz on behalf of single-use plastic bags, spreading the unproven claim that the virus is less likely to stick plastic than to the cloth fabric of reusable bags. Looking back at the crisis of 2008, we can see that emissions dropped then, too - only to rebound drastically in 2010 and 2011.\n\nSalamon believes that one lesson of the coronavirus crisis is the power of shared emotion, which has helped make possible radical action to slow the pandemic. \"I'm not talking about people giving each other medical expertise. I'm talking about people calling each other up and saying: 'How are you doing? Are you scared? I'm scared. I want you to be OK, I want us to be OK.' And that's what we want for climate, too. We need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we're terrified about.\" Only then, she said, would governments be forced to act. \"It's good that we're entering emergency mode about the pandemic,\" she said. \"But unless we also do it for climate ... \" She didn't finish the sentence.\n\nWhat kind of actions would it take for the optimists' vision to materialise? The historian Philip Mirowski, author of Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown, warns against complacency. \"The left thought it was so obvious to everyone that the crisis revealed the utter bankruptcy of a certain way of looking at the economy,\" he told me. \"And it wasn't obvious to everyone, and the left lost.\" How do we prevent the world from going back to a version of the way it was before Covid-19, with the virus vanquished but all of the old ongoing disasters still unfolding?\n\n\"The political outcome of the epidemic,\" said Mike Davis, \"will, like all political outcomes, be decided by struggle, by battles over interpretation, by pointing out what causes problems and what solves them. And we need to get that analysis out in the world any way we can.\" One major obstacle, of course, is social distancing, which certainly hinders many time-tested methods of waging such struggles, such as political canvassing and street protest. \"The biggest risk for all of us,\" said Klein, \"is going to be frittering away this time sitting at home on our social media feeds, living the extremely limited forms of politics that get enabled there.\"\n\nDavis hoped protesters would find their way into the streets sooner rather than later, and speculated that a street action with all the sign-holding participants spaced 10 or 15 feet apart would make a dramatic media image. He lives in P\u0101pa'aloa, a small community in Hawaii, and as our conversation wrapped up, he mentioned that he was planning to spend part of the afternoon doing his part by standing by himself on a street corner, holding a sign. He hadn't decided what to write on it yet, but was thinking about \"SUPPORT THE NURSES' UNION\" or \"DEMAND PAID SICK LEAVE\".\n\nSolnit told me she was taking heart from all the new ways people were finding to connect and help each other around the world, ranging from the neighbourhood delivery networks that had sprung up to bring groceries to people who couldn't get out, to more symbolic interventions, such as kids playing music on an older neighbour's porch. The Italian political scientist Alessandro Delfanti said he was finding hope from a post-outbreak wave of strikes roiling Amazon warehouses in the US and Europe, and also the steps that workers across different sectors of the Italian economy were taking to help each other secure equipment they needed to stay safe.\n\nWhat happens next might depend on the optimists' ability to transport such moments of solidarity into the broader political sphere, arguing that it makes no sense to address Covid-19 without at least trying to fix everything else, too, creating a world where our shared resources do more for more people. \"We don't even have a language for this emotion, in which the wonderful comes wrapped in the terrible, joy in sorrow, courage in fear. We cannot welcome disaster, but we can value the responses, both practical and psychological,\" Solnit wrote in A Paradise Built in Hell.\n\nThe world feels awfully strange right now, but not because - or not just because - it is changing so fast and any one of us could fall ill at any time, or could already be carrying the virus and not know it. It feels strange because the past few weeks have exposed the fact that the biggest things can always change, at any minute. This simple truth, both destabilising and liberating, is easy to forget. We're not watching a movie: we're writing one, together, until the end.\n\n* Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_c_baker@theguardian.com", "name": "Peter C Baker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shoshana Zuboff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rationality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Klein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Klein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Davis_(scholar)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Davis (scholar)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007\u20132008", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Solnit", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca Solnit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basic income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Global warming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xenophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatham House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

pipeline | Bill McKibben", "body": "The oil industry saw its opening and moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of this moment\n\nI'm going to tell you the single worst story I've heard in these past few horrid months, a story that combines naked greed, political influence peddling, a willingness to endanger innocent human beings, utter blindness to one of the greatest calamities in human history and a complete disregard for the next crisis aiming for our planet. I'm going to try to stay calm enough to tell it properly, but I confess it's hard.\n\nThe background: a decade ago, beginning with indigenous activists in Canada and farmers and ranchers in the American west and midwest, opposition began to something called the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry filthy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It quickly became a flashpoint for the fast-growing climate movement, especially after Nasa scientist James Hansen explained that draining those tar sands deposits would be \"game over\" for the climate system. And so thousands went to jail and millions rallied and eventually Barack Obama bent to that pressure and blocked the pipeline. Donald Trump, days after taking office, reversed that decision, but the pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the financing and permits, and because 30,000 people have trained to do nonviolent civil disobedience to block construction. It's been widely assumed that, should a Democrat win the White House in November, the project would finally be gone for good.\n\nAnd then came the coronavirus epidemic - and the oil industry saw its opening. It moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of the moment.\n\nIn Alberta, premier Jason Kenney, a pliant servant of the oil companies who had already set up a \"war room\" to fight environmentalists, invested $1.1bn of taxpayers' money to TC Energy to fund construction through the year, and set aside another $6bn in a loan guarantee.\n\nMeanwhile, on the southern side of the border, a series of states quickly adopted laws making it a felony to protest \"critical infrastructure\" like pipelines. (Last week South Dakota, a crucial link on the KXL route, made it a felony even to \"incite\" such protest.) And the Department of Health and Human Services issued a memorandum exempting pipeline construction from stay-at-home orders because such work was \"critical\" - that is, the department is asserting it is essential to build oil pipelines at the precise moment that the world is swimming in oil and that the Trump administration is boasting about getting Saudi and Russian autocrats to cut supply.\n\nOn Tuesday, TC Energy announced it was moving workers from across America into place in states along the pipeline route - although local reporters in Montana discovered they'd actually begun arriving 48 hours earlier, narrowly beating the state imposition of a quarantine.\n\nOn Thursday, JP Morgan Chase announced that it was leading a $1.25bn bond issue for TC Energy.\n\nSo here's how it shakes out:\n\n1) The oil industry is flying in workers from across America to rural states with already strained health care systems, at a moment when all Americans have been asked to shelter in place, and pretending that they are \"essential\" employees in order to build a pipeline that would carry oil no one wants or needs, and which would go a long way toward wrecking the planet's climate system.\n\n2) The work is being done on the edges of many Indian reservations - endangering a group of people who, over the centuries, have endured 90% population losses from introduced epidemics, and who are suffering horrible losses already from this one. As Faith Spotted Eagle of the Yankton Sioux put it on Wednesday, \"this causes eerie memories for us [of] the infected smallpox blankets that were distributed to tribes intentionally\".\n\n3) It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the oil industry is acting decisively now because it knows this is the one moment when protesters can't make themselves heard. Those 30,000 trained volunteers represent one of the great nonviolent armies in American history, willing to suffer to protect the planet - but they are moral human beings who will not risk taking microbes into prisons with them, and endanger prisoners crowded together in impossible conditions.\n\nThere are plenty of targets for anger - timid Democrats like Montana governor Steve Bullock, who could delay the construction, or like Joe Biden, who could have made it clear that the pipeline would be shut if he won, but who instead issued a statement to NPR which should be eligible for the mealy-mouthed hall of fame:\n\n\"Vice-president Biden supports establishing a process requiring that for any significant infrastructure project - including all pipelines - there must be a full review and accounting of the impact on climate, local environmental health and climate justice before any project can proceed. Vice-president Biden believes that the approach Secretary Kerry applied in analyzing the costs and benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline and other cross-border pipelines - including to national security and diplomacy - is a model to build from in establishing this process.\"\n\nBut let's be clear: the villains here are the oil industry and the big banks. And let's further be clear: their villainy is not new. The oil industry knew about and lied about climate change for 30 years: they've prevented us from flattening the carbon curve, and set up a tragedy far greater even than coronavirus and one which will play out for decades to come. And the banks are their invaluable allies: Chase Bank has lent $268bn to the industry since the Paris climate accords - what's another billion to build a useless pipeline and perhaps spread a fatal disease?\n\nLiterally nothing matters to these people except money. Even in a moment when the rest of us are changing our every habit to try and protect each other, they are willing to sacrifice nothing. No - let's be clear again. In this moment they are using the cover of the pandemic to make yet more money, to do things they could not get away with at any other time. These aren't penny-ante price gougers trying to corner the local market in hand sanitizer so they can make a buck - these are cold-blooded and calculating members of the one percent. It's so over-the-top evil that it's like the comic book version of Naomi Klein's Shock Doctrine, written in blood.\n\nI am a Methodist, sometimes a Sunday School teacher. I don't actually believe in hell - I think God is capable of forgiving people for the worst things. But I don't think I am.\n\nThough the hour is late, there may still be ways to fight this blitzkrieg. The coalitions that have battled it for a decade are, even forced apart by the microbe, now coming together to try. We will do it with real and unabating rage in our hearts.\n\nHow could anyone be this low?\n\nBill McKibben is an author and Schumann distinguished scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

miles) up the Amazon river from the state capital Manaus, Sesai said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nFour cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the same district, including a doctor who tested positive last week, raising fears the epidemic could spread to remote and vulnerable indigenous communities with devastating effect.\n\nSesai said the woman was a medical worker who had been in contact with the doctor. She was the only person to test positive among 15 health workers and 12 patients tested after the doctor was found to have the virus, Sesai said. Their names were not made public.\n\nThe doctor had returned from vacation in southern Brazil to work with the Tikunas, one of the largest tribes in the Amazon with more than 30,000 people who live in the upper Amazon near the borders with Colombia and Peru.\n\nThe woman has not shown symptoms of Covid-19 and has been isolated with her family, Sesai said.\n\nHealth experts warn that the spreading virus could be lethal for Brazil's 850,000 indigenous people, who have been decimated for centuries by diseases brought by Europeans, from smallpox and malaria to the flu.\n\nThey fear indigenous

billionaire retailer Philip Green is asking for taxpayer help to prop up his crumbling fashion empire with 14,500 employees set to be paid out of the government's emergency wage support scheme.\n\nLike other fashion retailers, Arcadia, which owns brands including Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, is facing financial turmoil as the lockdown forces Britons to stop shopping. The company has already asked landlords for rent cuts and paused payments into its pension scheme.\n\nArcadia closed its 550 shops a fortnight ago but, with no end to the high street shutdown in sight, said it had been forced to take the drastic step of standing down the majority of its staff. The retailer said 14,500 of its 16,000 employees - a group that includes shop and head office staff - would be furloughed by the weekend, leaving a skeleton team in place. The government's job retention scheme covers 80% of an employee's wage capped at a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month.\n\nThe economic upheaval triggered by the health crisis means companies are now queuing up to accept government help. British Airways also intends to use the government furlough scheme to stand down more than 30,000 staff, from cabin crew to ground staff, engineers and head office employees, until the end of May.\n\nThe carmaker Nissan is also using the government scheme to pay most of its 6,000 employees at its UK plant after announcing it will remain closed for the rest of the month at least. The Wearside plant, often described as Europe's most productive carmaker, was closed on 17 March.\n\nArcadia's chief executive, Ian Grabiner, who will receive no pay or benefits until further notice, said using the scheme was \"essential\" to get the company through \"these unprecedented times.\"\n\nOther board directors and senior managers had also agreed to take a salary reduction of between 25%-50%.\n\nNonetheless Green's use of government support is likely to rankle. The controversial businessman was lambasted for his stewardship of the now defunct BHS chain with a high-profile parliamentary investigation concluding it had been systematically plundered by its owners (Green eventually agreed to pay \u00a3363m into the BHS pension scheme).\n\nArcadia is owned by the entrepreneur's wife, Tina Green, who is based in tax-free Monaco. The couple famously banked a \u00a31.2bn dividend in 2005 which still stands as one of the biggest pay cheques in British corporate history. The fashion group, best known for its Topshop brand, last year only just managed to stave off collapse after creditors backed a rescue plan that involved the closure of 50 stores, 1,000 job losses and rent cuts of up to 50%.\n\nSofie Willmott, a retail analyst at the consultancy firm GlobalData, predicted other clothing and footwear chains would follow suit. \"With clothing and footwear spend dropping off a cliff, retailers are cutting costs where they can to protect their long-term futures. There is no work for store staff while non-essential physical locations remain closed and head office employees will have little to do other than manage the cancellation of orders and attempt to drive online sales.\"\n\nThousands of airline industry staff have been temporarily laid off or are taking unpaid leave due to the coronavirus crisis. EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic are setting up schemes for thousands of suspended crew to volunteer over the next two months with the NHS or work in supermarkets. Virgin Atlantic is to request a government bailout.\n\nBA, which grounded all its planes at Gatwick this week, has now reached deals with all three unions that represent its staff - Unite, GMB and Balpa, the pilots' union. The carrier is also encouraging its staff to join volunteering schemes. Unite said workers would be able to divert their pension contributions, worth between 9% and 18% of earnings, into their pay for a short period of time.\n\nBA, which employs 45,000 people in total, has struck a separate deal with its 4,000 pilots, who will take four weeks' unpaid leave between April and May.\n\nUnite's national officer for aviation, Oliver Richardson, said: \"Given the incredibly difficult circumstances that the entire aviation sector is facing, this is as good a deal as possible for our members. The deal protects the jobs of BA staff and, as far as possible, also protects their pay.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"This party has undermined, underfunded and sold off bits of the NHS. Coronavirus has not changed that simple fact\n\nIn most countries, slogans about the national effort to combat coronavirus have focused on survival or the human spirit. Iran has gone for the simple approach (\"Stay at home\"), Switzerland the communal (\"This affects us all\"), Italy is trying to spread a message of reassurance (\"Everything will be all right\"), India is pleading (\"Go corona go!\") and practical (\"Prepare, don't panic\"), and Argentina is focusing on gratitude to health workers (\"Thanks from my heart\"). Meanwhile, China has gone for the direct approach: \"If you hang out in public today / Grass will grow on your grave next year.\"\n\nBut the British government has opted for a different focus. With \"Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\", the message seems to be if you act responsibly you can protect your prized asset - and, as a byproduct, that will save lives.\n\nBoris Johnson, of course, has form with vacuous three-word slogans - be it \"Take back control\" or \"Get Brexit done\". And now we have a triptych slogan - three three-worders for the price of one. The first and last bit make perfect sense. Of course, we should stay at home to save lives. It's only when you add the bit in the middle that the slogan becomes questionable.\n\nFirst, there's the rank hypocrisy of a government that has spent 10 years doing the exact opposite of ordering us to protect the NHS. In fact, the Tory-led coalition was so little trusted with the NHS that David Cameron had to create his own slogan in 2011 to reassure the public: \"The NHS is safe in our hands\".\n\nOver the next decade, the Tories went on to neglect the NHS at best, pillage it at worst. Pre-Covid-19, the number of NHS hospital beds had fallen dramatically and we were short of an estimated 43,000 nurses.\n\nThe Tory government also did its best to quietly sell off parts of the NHS. In 2013 the government sold 80% of the state-owned blood plasma supplier to the US private equity firm Bain Capital for $200m. This despite the obscenity of Britain's contaminated blood scandal when more than 4,500 haemophiliacs became infected with hepatitis and HIV in the 1970s and 1980s after being poisoned with blood products brought on the cheap from abroad. In 2016 Britain's plasma supplier was sold on to a Chinese company for \u00a3820m (along with the government's remaining 20% stake). Protect the NHS? The Tories flogged the country's lifeblood for tuppence ha'penny.\n\nJohnson talks with pride about \"our NHS\" and our heroic NHS workers. Yet this is the same man who voted against scrapping the 1% pay-rise cap for NHS nurses in 2017, and was a member of the government that cheered when a pay rise for nurses was blocked.\n\nThen it was the turn of the health secretary, Matthew Hancock, to tell us how proud he was of us for staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives.\n\nThere is something distasteful about a government telling us to protect the NHS when the government itself is so obviously failing to do so in this terrible crisis. As of Thursday, only 7,000 out of 550,000 frontline NHS workers have been tested for Covid-19. Not only does this mean the government is failing to protect the NHS and its workers - it hasn't even been able to provide the required personal protective equipment - it is, in turn, failing to protect us all because the public could be treated by infected staff members.\n\nBut there's something about \"Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives\" that offends on an even deeper level. The slogan is a throwback to the Vote Leave campaign of 2016, which also famously weaponised the NHS. Back then, Johnson was pictured in front of a campaign bus with the following words plastered across it: \"We send the EU \u00a3350million a week, let's fund our NHS instead.\" (A figure that he later revised downwards by \u00a3100m). Johnson has always been aware that the NHS is an emotional trigger for the British people, and he has been quick to exploit it. This time round, he's using it just as cynically - but rather than bribing us with what can be added to the NHS, he's threatening us with what we can lose. Johnson is toying not only with our pride in the health service, but also our sense of ownership of it.\n\nWhether carrot or stick, it is offensive to assume we need an incentive to save lives. You can see it even more clearly in the choreography of the catchphrase at the daily press briefing, bookended by two towering union flags. Between each of the three elements there is an arrow to clarify the priorities - staying at home leads to protecting the NHS, and protecting the NHS in turn leads to saving lives.\n\nThis slogan might be intended to appeal to our love of the NHS, but in fact it debases it. The government has taken the concept of the NHS, stripped it of its core egalitarian beauty, and transformed it into little more than a material asset. If we don't stay at home we fail to protect the NHS, and stand to lose that which is rightfully ours.\n\nLike tens of millions of British people, I have stood in the street and applauded NHS and care workers. Like them, I am inordinately proud of, and thankful to, the NHS. But we don't need to be threatened with its devastation, or bribed with the promise of its salvation, to be encouraged to save lives.\n\nThe slogan has made staying at home purely about self-interest rather than solidarity and our common humanity. But we are bigger and better than that. However much we love the NHS, however much we want to protect the NHS, we are staying at home to save lives - not to safeguard our national assets. If we protect the NHS in the process, so much the better. A government that believed in its people would be content with a kinder, simpler slogan: stay at home and save lives.\n\n* Simon Hattenstone is a Guardian features writer", "source": {"uri":

"Communication Workers Union estimates half of sorting offices have insufficient PPE and sanitiser\n\nMany Royal Mail sorting offices are not providing workers with sufficient protection from coronavirus infection, according to a union which says some depots should close until staff are safe.\n\nThe Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents thousands of postal workers, told members they should stay away if their local sorting office had not provided equipment such as masks, gloves and hand sanitiser, or implemented government guidelines of 2-metre social distancing at all times. It estimates that at as many as half of sorting offices did not have sufficient protection in place.\n\nDave Ward, CWU general secretary, said: \"The conditions thousands of our members are being expected to work in are not safe. Provision of PPE (personal protective equipment) across the UK is sporadic and Royal Mail have admitted they have no data on what equipment is available in each office.\n\n\"Our members are fantastic public servants. They want to keep the UK connected and are willing to step up their role by checking on the elderly, delivering government services and assisting with food deliveries. They deserve better than to be told washing their hands is the 'gold standard' of safety.\"\n\nRoyal Mail has disputed the union's claims, saying it had provided hand soap for workers to clean their hands and latex gloves were available for those who wanted them. It said that \"wherever possible\" workers were being kept least 2 metres apart in depots.\n\nA spokesman said: \"Royal Mail takes the health and safety of our colleagues very seriously. Throughout this crisis, every decision we make puts the health of our people and our customers first. In assessing the risks to our people and making the necessary operational changes to protect them, we take professional medical and health and safety advice on a daily basis.\"\n\nRoyal Mail added that under new measures to protect postal workers on the doorstep, customers were not being passed handheld devices to sign for parcels - instead logging their name from a safe distance. From last week the company said only one person at a time was allowed in a delivery vehicle and junk mail was now only delivered alongside addressed mail.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"Royal Mail continues to engage with the CWU on a daily basis on this matter. We are pleased that at a local level and through national officers we have been working well together to find practical solutions to the many issues that have emerged. We have a joint interest in protecting our people and we hope that that focus can continue through the operational discussions taking place between our teams.\"\n\nHowever, more than a dozen Royal Mail workers have contacted the Guardian to say they were unhappy about the conditions in their local sorting office.\n\nOne said that there was not enough hand sanitiser available for post delivery staff to take on their rounds so that they feared taking a drink en route in case they got infected. \"We have staff working shoulder to shoulder. There is one bottle of sanitising gel to be shared by the whole office,\" he said.\n\nAnother said workers were \"cramped like sardines\" and many colleagues were off sick.\n\nThe CWU said it had asked Royal Mail to improve social distancing by cutting the number of staff working each shift and cutting the number of daily deliveries to three times a week with parcels, packets and first class mail delivered on alternate days.\n\nIt wants Royal Mail to prioritise the delivery of government communications, testing kits and other services and to halt the delivery of advertising flyers.\n\nWard said post delivery workers \"deserve better than to be delivering advertising mail at a time of high risk for them and the customers they serve\".\n\nThe concerns of postal workers come after similar complaints by those working in some online retail warehouses, including Asos's facility in Barnsley, where workers have said they are not happy with the protection on offer.",

intensive care at Walsall Manor hospital in the West Midlands, where she had worked for 16 years.\n\nTributes were also paid to another NHS nurse, named locally as mother-of-three Aimee O'Rourke, who is is believed to have contracted the virus before she died. She was described as \"a wonderful friend and colleague\" to those who worked with her at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital in Margate, Kent.\n\nPaying tribute to Nasreen, Toby Lewis, chief executive of the neighbouring Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, said it was clear from experiences overseas - in particular Italy where dozens of nurses and doctors have died - that health care workers are at risk.\n\n\"They are at risk not only from the patients we look after but from each other. There is additional grief counselling and psychological support being provided to staff because they are working in situations that are very different to those that they have worked in,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"Will more healthcare workers pass away? With the greatest regret I think that is a certainty. [However] it is our collective effort to try and minimise the number of tragedies that we see in the number of people who serve within the NHS.\"\n\nIt comes as Donna Kinnair, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, raised concerns with the health secretary that nurse deaths were not being counted amongst the official coronavirus mortality figures.\n\nOn BBC's Question Time, Kinnair pushed Matt Hancock to release the statistics relating to healthcare staff. She said: \"We haven't even counted the nurses yet. I keep asking for the stats on nurses,\" she said. \"I didn't know that, we will sort that out,\" Hancock replied.\n\nNasreen, also a mother-of-three, developed symptoms of coronavirus on 13 March, including aches, a high temperature and then a cough. She tested positive for the virus last Friday.\n\nIn a tribute posted on Facebook, her friend Rubi Aktar said: \"She was the most loveliest, genuine person you could ever meet, she went above and beyond for everyone she met. I'm so grateful that I had the honour to call her my best friend, she saw me at my best and my worst and accepted my every flaw. I am so broken that words can't explain.\"\n\nA relative told Birmingham Live: \"The immediate family are devastated. Everyone is in shock this morning. She was always so full of life. She was devoted to her job as a nurse, she absolutely loved it.\n\n\"She passed away doing what she loved. I'm really sad for the rest of the family, she was a fantastic person.\"\n\nNasreen qualified as a staff nurse in January last year and worked at the hospital's acute medical unit. She worked at Walsall Manor hospital from 2003, in housekeeping and as a healthcare assistant before studying to become a nurse.\n\nMeanwhile, O'Rourke's daughter, Megan Murphy, described her as an angel in a Facebook tribute.\n\nShe wrote: \"Look at all the lives you looked after and all the families you comforted when patients passed away. You are an angel and you will wear your NHS crown forevermore because you earned that crown the very first day you started!\n\n\"Your Meggy misses you beyond belief. One day when I have children of my own I will tell your grandchildren about their GG (glamorous gran) which you wanted to be called, every single day.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Murphy posted on social media urging people to shout her mother's name during the 8pm nationwide clap for NHS staff, before her condition deteriorated further.\n\nFriends and colleagues also paid tribute. Lucy Page wrote: \"Aimee taught to me fight for what I believe in and gave me courage so many times to do it. I was even more lucky not only to be her friend but her work colleague as well and I cannot tell how many times I saw her fighting for what was right for her patients.\n\n\"Aimee loved all her three beautiful girls, friends and family so much and she would go to any lengths to protect them.\"\n\n\"Life is so unfair. You were a wonderful friend and colleague. There will be a huge part of our team missing,\" added Kayley Walke.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

advice", "body": "Scotland's chief medical officer (CMO) has been photographed visiting her family's second home in Fife during the coronavirus pandemic, despite herself issuing advice to stay at home.\n\nPhotos of Dr Catherine Calderwood and her family near a coastal retreat in Earlsferry were published in the Scottish Sun late on Saturday.\n\nJust days earlier, the 51-year-old tweeted a photo of her family from their main residence in Edinburgh as they clapped for NHS staff working to stop the spread of Covid-19.\n\nThe paper said her home in the capital was just two-and-a-half miles from the Scottish government building where Calderwood delivers daily briefings on the virus with the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nEarlsferry is a drive of more than an hour from Edinburgh.\n\nThe images emerged amid continuing advice from the CMO and other leading medical professionals and politicians to stay at home in order to save lives and protect the NHS.\n\nLast month, the Scottish government issued a travel warning criticising the \"irresponsible behaviour\" of people with second homes and camper vans travelling to the Highlands in an effort to isolate.\n\nOn Friday, Sturgeon said the upcoming Easter break would be \"a holiday period unlike any we've had in our lifetimes\".\n\nCalderwood also stressed people should adhere to the restrictions, and said it was looking less likely that holidays would take place this year as they have done previously.\n\nA Scottish government spokesman said on Saturday: \"Since the start of this epidemic, the CMO has been working seven days a week preparing Scotland's response.\n\n\"She took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fife as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over. She stayed overnight before returning to Edinburgh.\n\n\"In line with guidance, she stayed within her own household group and observed social distancing with anyone she was in passing in the village.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Calderwood", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Calderwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief Medical Officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fife"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fife"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Highlands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Home_Office", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Home Office", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work and Family", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c41e8e7d3e1025ec0285170ed01bef5a528f1c3f/0_52_3500_2100/master/3500..jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=1089cc4ce37c6db683d48c7dac985f68", "eventUri": "eng-5660438", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 7082}, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 7082, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6013794770", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-30", "time": "20:11:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-30T20:11:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-30T18:45:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/uk-discussed-joint-eu-plan-to-buy-covid-19-medical-supplies-say-officials", "title": "UK discussed joint EU plan to buy Covid-19 medical supplies, say officials", "body": "British officials took part in four meetings where EU projects to bulk-buy medical kit were discussed - the earliest in January, according to official minutes that heap doubt on government claims of missing an email.\n\nLast week Downing Street claimed that it failed to take part in an EU scheme to source life-saving ventilators and other kit to treat coronavirus because it accidentally missed the deadline.\n\nNo 10 initially said it did not take part because the UK was no longer a member of the EU and was \"making our own efforts\". After critics accused Boris Johnson of putting \"Brexit over breathing\", Downing Street clarified that missing out was an error and it would consider participating in future. It is understood the UK claimed not to have received an email from the EU asking it to participate.\n\nEU minutes seen by the Guardian show that a British official joined eight out of 12 EU health security committee meetings dedicated to the Covid-19 outbreak since the group was set up earlier this year, shortly before China's Hubei province was put into lockdown.\n\nAt least four of those meetings discussed EU procurement schemes on: 31 January, 4 February, 2 March and 13 March.\n\nWhile the government marked Brexit day on 31 January, a British representative joined EU member states and commission officials to discuss what was then called \"the cluster of pneumonia cases associated with novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\".\n\nAt this meeting, four EU member states said the virus could require increased stocks in Europe of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks and goggles, and the commission said it was ready to help if asked.\n\nThe EU executive stated it was ready to help countries bulk-buy medical equipment on 4 February. By 2 March, officials at the commission's health department reported that 20 EU countries wanted to join a procurement scheme for personal protective equipment, such as overalls, gloves and face-shields. Later that month, on 13 March, EU officials discussed the combined purchase of ventilators.\n\nPeter Liese, a German MEP and medical doctor who sits on the European parliament's public health committee, said there had also been telephone calls between British and EU officials about the EU procurement scheme. \"I know that they [British officials] were at a working level interested in joint procurement,\" he told the Guardian.\n\nThe veteran German MEP dismissed UK government claims they missed an email. \"It was not that they were not aware, but it was a decision not to participate,\" he said. \"If you are interested you don't wait for an email.\"\n\nThe UK was also able to sign up for EU procurement schemes via the EU's \"Early Warning and Response System\", an intranet site where European countries exchange information about communicable diseases.\n\nThe UK health department and the cabinet office have been contacted for comment.\n\nThe government claimed last week that the UK \"did not receive an invitation in time to join in four joint procurements in response to the coronavirus pandemic\". Cabinet office minister Michael Gove repeated this account on Sunday, when he said there had been \"communication confusion\", although added he was unaware of the details.\n\nThe Department of Health initially declined to comment when the Guardian reported last week that the UK had decided not to participate in any of four EU procurement schemes to buy medical equipment in response to the coronavirus crisis.\n\nNearly all EU countries, 25 out of 27, are taking part in the project for shared purchase of ventilators, while the same number are joining forces to buy protective kit for medical staff, such as masks and overalls. Separately, 19 are teaming up to buy laboratory equipment needed for tests.\n\nUnder then prime minister David Cameron, the government signed the EU's joint procurement agreement in 2014, which was drawn up after some member states experienced shortages of medical kit during the H1N1 pandemic. The terms of the Brexit transition deal means the government has the right to take part in EU joint procurement until 31 December 2020.\n\nThe logic behind joint procurement is to reduce red tape, get better prices through wholesale purchase and take advantage of medical purchasing skills that may be weaker in some countries, especially smaller ones.\n\nLiese urged the UK government to continue working with the rest of Europe on the search for better treatments and a vaccine against Covid-19. \"When the scientists from Berlin, Rome, Paris, Oxford and Cambridge work together [on treatments] we are faster and better than if we would work separately. The same applies to vaccines. European cooperation is crucial.\"\n\nThe European commission said on Friday the UK \"is most welcome to join any future procurement launch\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":
