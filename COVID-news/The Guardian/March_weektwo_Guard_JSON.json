In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor's advice.\"\n\nHealth officials point out that anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body's immune system.\n\nThe health ministry added that patients should choose paracetamol because \"it will reduce the fever without counterattacking the inflammation\".\n\nFrench patients have been forced to consult pharmacies since mid-January if they want to buy popular painkillers, including ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin, to be reminded of the risks.\n\nJean-Louis Montastruc, the head of pharmacology at Toulouse hospital, told RTL radio: \"Anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of complications when there is a fever or infection.\"\n\nThe French health ministry announced on Friday evening that the number of coronavirus case in the country had increased by 800 in 24 hours. V\u00e9ran said there were 3,661 confirmed cases that had lead to 79 deaths. Of the sick, 154 people are in intensive care.\n\nV\u00e9ran said in his daily briefing that the evolution and spread of the virus was \"rapid and real\", but that 98% of those who had tested positive had recovered.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower, Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, Louvre, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay and Centre Pompidou are among the public attractions that have closed. The archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, said there would be no Sunday masses held in churches in the Paris region.\n\nAbout 400 gilets jaunes, or yellow vests, gathered in Paris for \"Act 70\", the 70th consecutive Saturday of protests since November 2018. An authorised march from Montparnasse station to Bercy, where the economy ministry is situated, is expected to go ahead. Public gatherings of more than 100 people have been banned in France, but it has been reported that demonstrations are exempt.\n\nSSchools closed across the country after lessons on Saturday, meaning 12.4 million students will remain at home. The education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has said they will be expected to follow the national curriculum syllabus by internet. \"This coming period is not one in which the youngsters don't have to work,\" he told BFMTV.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kim_willsher@theguardian.com", "name": "Kim Willsher", "type":

trying to fight off what it sees as an aggressive takeover bid by the US, the broadsheet Die Welt reports, citing German government circles.\n\nThe US president had offered the T\u00fcbingen-based biopharmaceutical company CureVac \"large sums of money\" to gain exclusive access to their work, wrote Die Welt.\n\nTrump was doing everything to secure a vaccine against the coronavirus for the US, the newspaper quoted an anonymous source, \"but for the US only\".\n\nThe German government was reportedly offering its own financial incentives for the vaccine to stay in the country.\n\nWhen approached about the report by the Guardian, the German health ministry would only confirm the accuracy of the quotes attributed to one of its spokespersons in the article.\n\n\"The federal government is very interested in vaccines and antiviral agents against the novel coronavirus being developed in Germany and Europe,\" the spokesperson quoted in the article said. \"In this regard the government is in an intensive exchange with the company CureVac.\"\n\nThe German health ministry spokesperson declined the opportunity to correct any inaccuracies in Die Welt's account.\n\nWith its headquarters in the south-western German city of T\u00fcbingen, CureVac also has sites in Frankfurt and Boston in the US. Linked with the German health ministry, it works closely with the Paul Ehrlich Institute, a research institution and medical regulatory body that is subordinate to the German health ministry.\n\nOn 11 March, CureVac released a statement that its CEO, the US citizen Daniel Menichella, was unexpectedly leaving the firm and would be replaced by the company's founder, Ingmar Hoerr.\n\nAt the start of the month, Menichella was invited to the White House in Washington to discuss strategy for the rapid development and production of a coronavirus vaccine with Trump, the vice-president, Mike Pence, and members of the White House coronavirus task force.\n\nThe White House has been contacted for comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Oliver Laughland", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

Thordarson", "body": "Alcohol-based disinfectants are also effective, but soap is a highly efficient way of killing the virus when it's on your skin\n\nViruses can be active outside the body for hours, even days. Disinfectants, liquids, wipes, gels and creams containing alcohol are all useful at getting rid of them - but they are not quite as good as normal soap.\n\nWhen I shared the information above using Twitter, it went viral. I think I have worked out why. Health authorities have been giving us two messages: once you have the virus there are no drugs that can kill it or help you get rid of it. But also, wash your hands to stop the virus spreading. This seems odd. You can't, even for a million dollars, get a drug for the coronavirus - but your grandmother's bar of soap kills the virus.\n\nSo why does soap work so well on the Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus and indeed most viruses? The short story: because the virus is a self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid (fatty) bilayer. Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls apart like a house of cards and dies - or rather, we should say it becomes inactive as viruses aren't really alive.\n\nThe slightly longer story is that most viruses consist of three key building blocks: ribonucleic acid (RNA), proteins and lipids. A virus-infected cell makes lots of these building blocks, which then spontaneously self-assemble to form the virus. Critically, there are no strong covalent bonds holding these units together, which means you do not necessarily need harsh chemicals to split those units apart. When an infected cell dies, all these new viruses escape and go on to infect other cells. Some end up also in the airways of lungs.\n\nWhen you cough, or especially when you sneeze, tiny droplets from the airways can fly up to 10 metres. The larger ones are thought to be the main coronavirus carriers and they can go at least two metres.\n\nThese tiny droplets end on surfaces and often dry out quickly. But the viruses remain active. Human skin is an ideal surface for a virus. It is \"organic\" and the proteins and fatty acids in the dead cells on the surface interact with the virus.\n\nWhen you touch, say, a steel surface with a virus particle on it, it will stick to your skin and hence get transferred on to your hands. If you then touch your face, especially your eyes, nostrils or mouth, you can get infected. And it turns out that most people touch their face once every two to five minutes.\n\nWashing the virus off with water alone might work. But water is not good at competing with the strong, glue-like interactions between the skin and the virus. Water isn't enough.\n\nSoapy water is totally different. Soap contains fat-like substances known as amphiphiles, some of which are structurally very similar to the lipids in the virus membrane. The soap molecules \"compete\" with the lipids in the virus membrane. This is more or less how soap also removes normal dirt from the skin.\n\nThe soap not only loosens the \"glue\" between the virus and the skin but also the Velcro-like interactions that hold the proteins, lipids and RNA in the virus together.\n\nAlcohol-based products, which pretty much includes all \"disinfectant\" products, contain a high-percentage alcohol solution (typically 60-80% ethanol) and kill viruses in a similar fashion. But soap is better because you only need a fairly small amount of soapy water, which, with rubbing, covers your entire hand easily. Whereas you need to literally soak the virus in ethanol for a brief moment, and wipes or rubbing a gel on the hands does not guarantee that you soak every corner of the skin on your hands effectively enough.\n\nSo, soap is the best, but do please use alcohol-based sanitiser when soap is not handy or practical.\n\n* Palli Thordarson is a professor of chemistry at the University of New South Wales,

7.9m hospitalised'", "body": "The coronavirus epidemic in the UK will last until next spring and could lead to 7.9m people being hospitalised, a secret Public Health England briefing for senior NHS officials reveals.\n\nThe document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for another 12 months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS.\n\nIt also suggests that health chiefs are braced for as many as 80% of Britons becoming infected with the coronavirus over that time.\n\nProf Chris Whitty, the government's chief medical adviser, has previously described that figure as the worst-case scenario and suggested that the real number would turn out to be less than that. However, the briefing makes clear that four in five of the population \"are expected\" to contract the virus.\n\nThe document says that: \"As many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9m people) may require hospitalisation.\"\n\nThe briefing sets out the latest official thinking about how severely the infection could affect both the public's health and that of personnel in critical services such as the NHS, police, the fire brigade and transport.\n\nIt has been drawn up in recent days by PHE's emergency preparedness and response team and approved as accurate by Dr Susan Hopkins, PHE's lead official dealing with the outbreak. It has been shared with hospital bosses and senior doctors in the NHS in Engand.\n\n\"For the public to hear that it could last for 12 months, people are going to be really upset about that and pretty worried about that\", said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia.\n\n\"A year is entirely plausible. But that figure isn't well appreciated or understood,\" added Hunter, an expert in the epidemiology of infectious diseases.\n\n\"I think it will dip in the summer, towards the end of June, and come back in November, in the way that usual seasonal flu does. I think it will be around forever, but become less severe over time, as immunity builds up,\" he added.\n\nThe admission that the virus will continue to cause problems for another year appears to undermine hopes that the arrival of warmer weather this summer would kill it.\n\nThe document also discloses that an estimated 500,000 of the 5m people deemed vital because they work \"in essential services and critical infrastructure\" will be off sick at any one time during a \"months\"-long peak of the epidemic. The 5m include 1m NHS staff and 1.5m in social care.\n\nHowever, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally and by warning that: \"It is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.\" Under revised health advice Boris Johnson unveiled last Thursday, anyone with a cough should self-isolate for at least seven days.\n\nThe document also states that:\n\nthe health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are \"under significant demand pressures\"\n\nfrom now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested\n\ntesting services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients\n\nA senior NHS figure involved in preparing for the growing \"surge\" in patients whose lives are being put at risk by Covid-19 said an 80% infection rate could lead to more than half a million people dying.\n\nIf the mortality rate turns out to be the 1% many experts are using as their working assumption then that would mean 531,100 deaths. But if Whitty's insistence that the rate will be closer to 0.6% proves accurate, then that would involve 318,660 people dying.\n\nExperts advising governments worldwide on the way epidemics grow and eventually decline say there will be a rapid rise in cases to a peak - and then a falling off. Whitty, who has seen the modelling done by UK and global scientists, says the case numbers will go up fast over the next 10 to 14 weeks.\n\nThat will mean a peak at around the end of May to mid-June, when the NHS will be under great pressure. The strategy of all countries is to delay that peak and stretch it out over a longer period of time, so that health services are better able to cope. There is also the possibility that new treatments will be available by then.\n\nAfter the peak, case numbers and deaths are expected to drop for 10 weeks or more, until they reach a fairly low level, which may not be zero. In the summer months especially, the case numbers are expected to reduce because people spend more time out of doors and are less likely to be confined at close quarters in small rooms in a house or office with people who are infected.\n\nThere is still a worry that the virus could resurge in the autumn or winter months, which means planning for the long term will be necessary. Until a vaccine is developed, perhaps in 18 months, health planners cannot be sure of being able to protect people from the disease.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Jones", "body": "Thanks to a decade of austerity, the Tories have ensured the pandemic will hit the poor the hardest\n\nThe British class system is, at its worst, a killer. Men living in the poorest communities in the UK have an average of 9.4 years shorn off their life expectancies compared with those in the richest areas; for women, it's 7.4 years. If you travel on the Jubilee Line from Westminster to Canning Town, every stop represents a year less in the average lifespan of local citizens. For the poorest women, life expectancy is in reverse.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is about to collide with this engine of inequality. The super-rich are fleeing on private jets to luxury boltholes in foreign climes, while the well-to-do may deploy their private health insurance to circumvent our already struggling and soon to be overrun National Health Service. Meanwhile, Britain's army of precarious workers have nowhere to hide, including from employment that puts their health at risk. Uber drivers, Deliveroo riders, cleaners: all in low-paid jobs, often with families to feed. Many will feel they have no choice but to keep working. While many middle-class professionals can protect themselves by working from home, supermarket shelves cannot be stacked remotely, and the same applies from factory workers to cleaners. How many could truly afford to live on \u00a394.25 a week, which is our country's paltry statutory sick pay?\n\nThose with underlying health conditions are most at risk from coronavirus, and again, the impact differs depending on which rung you're condemned to on the British social ladder. Previous research by the British Heart Foundation found that working-class Tameside in the north-west has a heart disease mortality rate more than three times higher than well-to-do Kensington and Chelsea. According to Asthma UK: \"Asthma is more prevalent within more deprived communities, and those living in more deprived areas of England are more likely to go to hospital for their asthma.\" Diabetes is far more common among those living in poverty, and there is a strong link between lung disease and deprivation. 1.9 million pensioners languish below the poverty line: their health will be, on average, worse than their affluent counterparts', meaning their lives will be significantly more imperilled.\n\nWe know that depression and stress weaken our immune systems, and the research is clear: those on low incomes are disproportionately likely to suffer from poor mental health. Poor diet is another factor, and one that is strongly linked to poverty. What, too, of our most impoverished, those who are homeless with poor nutrition, weaker immune systems and a lack of access to good hygiene? And what happens to the 1.5 million children eligible for free school meals if our education sector is temporarily closed? Many could soon find themselves with hungry bellies.\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to unleash mayhem, we could be on the precipice of an economic shock on the scale of the 2008 financial crash. Despite the rhetoric, the latest budget doesn't reverse the damage to our social fabric inflicted by a decade of austerity. Indeed, the recent budget entrenches cuts in key services outside of the NHS and police. If a renewed economic crisis is on the cards, we can expect the Tories to ensure it is once again paid for by increasingly impoverished children, benefit claimants and a working-age population that has suffered the longest squeeze in real wages for generations.\n\nWe know the rich look after their own, but these injustices are not acts of God or mere sad facts of life to be shrugged at with resignation. There will be many terrible lessons to learn from this pandemic: one is a lesson that should have been learned long ago, that inequality kills.\n\nA decade of austerity, and a social order that deprives millions of citizens of a comfortable existence, will mean many more deaths in the coming weeks and months that could have been avoided. The government's determination to discover a vaccine for coronavirus must be accompanied by a renewed commitment to addressing poverty. Like every crisis, this one is likely to affect working-class and poor people worst. That is not inevitable. It's a choice - and one within our power to stop, if only we had the will to do so.\n\n* Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

"body": "The coronavirus outbreak has revealed the full stupidity, incompetence and selfishness of the president to deadly effect\n\nFor three long years the world has been treated to the sick joke of Donald Trump's presidency. Some days were more sick than others. But now the joke is over.\n\nSo is the entire facade of the Trump White House: the gold-plated veneer of power and grift will be stripped bare by a global pandemic and recession.\n\nOf all the obituaries we'll read in the next several weeks, every one will be more meaningful than the political end of a former reality-TV star.\n\nBut make no mistake. The humanitarian crisis about to unfold will consume what's left of this president and the Republican party that surrendered its self-respect and sense of duty to flatter his ego and avoid his angry tweets.\n\nTrump was right about one thing, and only one thing, as the coronavirus started to spread across the world. The sight of thousands of dead Americans will hurt him politically. It will also hurt many thousands of Americans in reality.\n\nMultiple reports have detailed how Trump did not just ignore the growing pandemic; he actively sought to block his own officials' attempts to track and stop it. Why has there been such a disastrous lack of testing? Because the president didn't want to know the answer, and because his staff were too busy fighting each other to do the right thing.\n\n\"The boss has made it clear he likes to see his people fight, and he wants the news to be good,\" Politico reported one Trump health adviser saying. \"This is the world he's made.\"\n\nNever mind a world turned upside down by fear and death. Trump's world is upended by his gobsmackingly childish comments about how the whole thing will blow over. \"It's going to disappear,\" he told one reception inside the White House just two weeks ago. \"One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear.\"\n\nThe only miracle of this presidency is that it's taken so long for this country to wake up to the catastrophe.\n\nHow could we have known that Trump would deny the resources to deal with a disaster, deny the truth about the death toll, and denounce anyone daring to tell the truth?\n\nIt wasn't hard to know. After Hurricane Maria devastated the American island of Puerto Rico in September of his first year in office, Trump gave himself a 10 for his response to the devastation. He also said he couldn't keep the military in Puerto Rico forever, which was news to the national guard.\n\nAt the very time he was bragging about his response and trashing his own citizens, more than 3,000 Americans were dying on the island because of Trump's botched response to the hurricane. Those Americans were our most vulnerable citizens: the sick and elderly, who lost power, lacked medicine or needed a hospital bed when the hospitals were stricken.\n\nThose are the same Americans who face the greatest peril in the coming weeks from the same toxic mix of callousness and incompetence from the same sociopathic president.\n\nThis is everyone's catastrophe and one man's calamity. For Trump, there is no escaping the stench of failure that seeps through every unmade decision, every fumbled response, and every unhinged tweet.\n\nThis is a president who can't formulate a coherent coronavirus policy, and can't even read the words written for him on a prompter.\n\nOne paragraph from Wednesday's disastrous Oval Office address managed to only worsen the political pathogen that is his presidency.\n\n\"There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings,\" he explained about his new travel ban from Europe, ignoring the reality that he limited all testing so there are no appropriate screenings.\n\n\"And these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval,\" he added, wiping out many billions in transatlantic trade - and various other things - with one flap of his lips.\n\n\"Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing,\" he explained in case anyone had any doubt about his economic stupidity.\n\n\"These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom.\" Ah yes, the British immunity to coronavirus is a well-documented medical fact. British people who play golf on a Trump course are especially healthy individuals.\n\nIf Trump was trying to reassure the markets, he failed, like he always does. Even the Federal Reserve magicking $1.5tn out of thin air could not stop the stock market from suffering its worst single day since the 1987 crash.\n\n\"This was the most expensive speech in history,\" one investment strategist told the Financial Times.\n\nThere is hope amid the horror: an election in just eight months when Americans can vote for a return to the once-normal life of a competent government. Joe Biden's response on Thursday was a stark reminder of what presidents and vice-presidents used to sound like.\n\n\"We'll lead with science,\" the former vice-president said. \"We'll listen to the experts. We'll heed their advice.\" It all sounded so shockingly novel. \"We'll build American leadership and rebuild it to rally the world to meet global threats that we are likely to face again. And I'll always tell you the truth.\"\n\nThe truth: it's getting harder to remember a time when we expected our leaders to say such things.\n\nIn the meantime, before January 2021, the world faces two deadly diseases: a pandemic and a pathetically incompetent president.\n\nOn Thursday, as schools shut down and troops took to the streets of a New York suburb, Trump of course bragged about himself in ways that made you wonder about his own medical condition.\n\n\"I mean, think of it: the United States, because of what I did and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point,\" he said in the Oval Office. \"Thirty-two is a lot. Thirty-two is too many. But when you look at the kind of numbers that you're seeing coming out of other countries, it's pretty amazing when you think of it.\"\n\nAnd you know what? Instead of thinking about preparing thousands of new hospital beds, or millions of virus tests, Trump has probably committed the largest part of his brain to thinking about that number. That very tiny number, so small compared to the rest of the world, that represents the full measure of his compassion.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/america-public-health-system-coronavirus-trump", "title": "America has no real public health system - coronavirus has a clear run | Robert Reich", "body": "Dr Anthony S Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and just about the only official in the Trump administration trusted to tell the truth about the coronavirus, said last Thursday: \"The system does not, is not really geared to what we need right now ... It is a failing, let's admit it.\"\n\nWhile we're at it, let's admit something more basic. The system would be failing even under a halfway competent president. The dirty little secret, which will soon become apparent to all, is that there is no real public health system in the United States.\n\nThe ad hoc response fashioned late Friday by House Democrats and the White House may help a bit, although it's skimpy, as I'll explain.\n\nAs the coronavirus outbreak in the US follows the same grim exponential growth path first displayed in Wuhan, China, before herculean measures were put in place to slow its spread there, America is waking up to the fact that it has almost no public capacity to deal with it.\n\nInstead of a public health system, we have a private for-profit system for individuals lucky enough to afford it and a rickety social insurance system for people fortunate enough to have a full-time job.\n\nAt their best, both systems respond to the needs of individuals rather than the needs of the public as a whole. In America, the word \"public\" - as in public health, public education or public welfare - means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good.\n\nContrast this with America's financial system. The Federal Reserve concerns itself with the health of financial markets as a whole. Late last week the Fed made $1.5tn available to banks, at the slightest hint of difficulties making trades. No one batted an eye.\n\nWhen it comes to the health of the nation as a whole, money like this isn't available. And there are no institutions analogous to the Fed with responsibility for overseeing and managing the public's health - able to whip out a giant checkbook at a moment's notice to prevent human, rather than financial, devastation.\n\nEven if a test for the Covid-19 virus had been developed and approved in time, no institutions are in place to administer it to tens of millions of Americans free of charge. Local and state health departments are already bare bones, having lost nearly a quarter of their workforce since 2008, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nHealthcare in America is delivered mainly by private for-profit corporations which, unlike financial institutions, are not required to maintain reserve capacity. As a result, the nation's supply of ventilators isn't nearly large enough to care for projected numbers of critically ill coronavirus victims unable to breathe for themselves. Its 45,000 intensive care unit beds fall woefully short of the 2.9 million likely to be needed.\n\nThe Fed can close banks to quarantine financial crises but the US can't close workplaces because the nation's social insurance system depends on people going to work.\n\nAlmost 30% of American workers have no paid sick leave from their employers, including 70% of low-income workers earning less than $10.49 an hour. Vast numbers of self-employed workers cannot afford sick leave. Friday's deal between House Democrats and the White House won't have much effect because it exempts large employers and offers waivers to smaller ones.\n\nMost jobless Americans don't qualify for unemployment insurance because they haven't worked long enough in a steady job and the ad-hoc deal doesn't alter this. Meanwhile, more than 30 million Americans have no health insurance. Eligibility for Medicaid, food stamps and other public assistance is now linked to having or actively looking for work.\n\nIt's hard to close public schools because most working parents cannot afford childcare. Many poor children rely on school lunches for their only square meal a day. In Los Angeles, about 80% of students qualify for free or reduced lunches and just under 20,000 are homeless at some point during the school year.\n\nThere is no public health system in the US, in short, because the richest nation in the world has no capacity to protect the public as a whole, apart from national defense. Ad-hoc remedies such as House Democrats and the White House fashioned on Friday are better than nothing, but they don't come close to filling this void.\n\nRobert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

Trump may exploit the coronavirus crisis for authoritarian ends | Andrew Gawthorpe", "body": "When he no can longer lie or deny, he'll blame immigrants, journalists, people of color, liberals and other enemies\n\nDonald Trump's Oval Office address on coronavirus was terrifying because it revealed a man completely unmatched to the moment. Even though he was reading from a teleprompter, the president got the details of his major policy announcements wrong. He attempted no emotional connection with or comfort of the tens of millions of Americans whose lives are being upended by the threat of the disease. He didn't even have anything useful to say about what his own top scientist has described as America's \"failing\" testing regime, which has screened about as many people all year as South Korea does in a day. In a presidency accustomed to lows, this one was quite literally sickening.\n\nTrump had an unusual deer-in-the-headlights quality during his address, seeming to reveal that even he realizes his lie-and-deny operation cannot last for much longer. His allies in the media are busy trying to downplay the virus, but anyone who switches over to a real news channel can see what is happening in Italy, where doctors feel forced to leave the elderly to die and hospitals are struggling to bury the dead. With estimates of the number of Americans who might require intensive care running into the millions and only about 45,000 ICU beds available in the US, similar scenes might soon be playing out at home.\n\nWhen Trump and his allies can no longer lie or deny, we can expect them to move on to the next phase of their crisis management playbook: attacking their enemies. It is already clear that they intend to interpret the virus not primarily as an existential threat to millions of Americans, but as an existential threat to their own political power. With the markets tumbling and Trump's re-election suddenly in doubt, it is only a matter of time before the right goes on the offensive. When they do, it won't be the virus in their sights, but the familiar foes: journalists, experts, blue states, immigrants and people of color.\n\nAt this point, the coronavirus pandemic will intersect with Trump's authoritarian impulses in truly frightening ways. With parts of the country experiencing levels of privation and death rarely seen in peacetime, Trump will feel justified in invoking emergency powers. In a declared state of emergency, the president has extraordinary powers, including the ability to freeze an American's finances and deprive them of the ability to legally work, to control digital communications, and to deploy the military domestically. Aside from these enumerated items, Trump has repeatedly shown that he anyway believes that there are no legal or constitutional limits on presidential authority.\n\nMost worrying of all are the implications for immigrant communities and people of color. Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he has a racialized view of who is a \"true\" American, from denying Barack Obama's citizenship to telling congresswomen of color born in the US to \"go back\" to where \"they came\" from. It would be extraordinary if this doesn't at the very least color his decisions on where to send federal aid and how to deploy his emergency powers. There is also a disturbing likelihood that Trump will attempt to stoke racism in order to rally his base and present the coronavirus as an alien plot against (white) America.\n\nAlready the right has shown a tendency to lash out at foreigners in its response to the virus, from insisting on labeling it \"Wuhan coronavirus\" to carrying out border closures while doing little to stop transmission within the United States. In a bizarre statement, Senator Tom Cotton even threatened to \"hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world\". Once the virus is undeniably established in America, it is all too likely that this animus and psychological need for scapegoats will be directed at those the right considers alien interlopers at home. The results - both from the misuse of state power, and from privately - inflicted terrorism and violence - could be profound.\n\nIt is also time to start worrying about the 2020 election. If the economy has crashed, there are countless dead, and Trump is badly trailing in the polls, it is almost inevitable that he will attempt to cast doubt on the wisdom and legitimacy of holding a November election. He would not have to do anything so drastic as to attempt to call off the election - instead, he could call for his supporters to boycott it, then simply refuse to acknowledge the result. If the Republican party faces an electoral wipeout, its craven behavior over the last few years can give us no confidence that the party would defend the democratic process and eject Trump from the White House.\n\nIn short, nothing in Trump's record - or that of his ardent base, whose political support is all he cares about - can lead us to believe that he will use his power to protect and serve all Americans equally in a time of unprecedented crisis. He might look like a deer in the headlights right now, but soon enough he will snap back to the unreality he lives in and deploy the only political trick he knows: rallying his base, abusing his power, trashing his foes. Many Americans will have to deal with the reality of a president who is not only incompetent to defend them but doesn't even regard them as legitimate Americans worthy of protection. This epidemiological crisis is also a political one. We should prepare to defend against both.\n\nAndrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

This means it will no longer be part of the EU's regulatory regime, which allows for \"accelerated assessment\" of products developed by drugs companies during a pandemic.\n\nThe UK has already withdrawn from the EU's emergency bulk-buying mechanism for vaccines and medicines, under which member states strike collective agreements with pharmaceutical companies, which speeds up their access to the latest products during a crisis.\n\nThe academics write: \"For all these reasons ... the UK is likely to have to join the queue for access with other countries outside the EU, and to pay more than it would otherwise as an EU member state.\n\n\"Looking further ahead, this problem will not be limited to emergencies and the UK can expect slower and more limited access to medicines, especially those for rare conditions or those used to treat children, where the market is small.\"\n\nThey argue that the UK could still avoid the worst by agreeing to align fully with the EMA's regulations from outside the EU. But they say Johnson has so far indicated that his team have no intention of doing so and do not want to operate as \"rule takers\".\n\nWhile it appears the UK government wants to press ahead with its own regulatory system and rapid market authorisation system for emergencies, the experts say this will be all but impossible to put in place in time for a new Covid-19 vaccine, which is expected in about a year.\n\nEven then the view in medical circles is that pharmaceutical companies are likely to look first to the EU for regulatory approval and an agreement on sale, given the scale of the market they would be selling into.\n\nOlivier Wouters of the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: \"After the Brexit transition period, the UK will no longer be part of the EMA and will therefore have to make its own regulatory decisions, unless ongoing EU-UK trade negotiations result in the UK aligning itself with European rules.\n\n\"The UK could, in theory, choose to recognise any approval decision made by the EMA to prevent delays, but this seems at odds with the UK government's pledge to 'take back control'. If the UK authorities instead choose to set up a separate review and approval process for medicines and vaccines, then it might delay access to a new coronavirus therapy.\n\n\"The country could experience disruptions as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the country's counterpart to the EMA, works to fill the gap left by the departure of the EMA.\n\n\"Vaccine makers and drug companies may decide to first seek approval from the EMA, which represents some 500 million patients, before seeking approval from the UK MHRA, which covers a smaller patient pool.\"\n\nAsked about the prospect of the UK having to pay higher prices for a vaccine, he said: \"If a coronavirus vaccine is developed, EU countries may choose to band together to jointly procure the vaccine. This would give EU countries more bargaining power against a vaccine maker to try to secure a lower price. If the UK were excluded from such a joint procurement scheme, it's possible that the UK would end up paying a higher price than the EU for the same vaccine.\"\n\nEMA was based in London until January last year, when Brexit saw it relocate to Amsterdam.\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The UK and our friends and partners across Europe are part of a concerted international effort to combat the threat of COVID-19. We are confident that our current close working relationships will continue as we ready ourselves for all eventualities. We're fully supporting the UK's world-leading, disease research sector to play a key role in the global effort, with \u00a340 million of new funding for rapid research into the virus.\"", "source":

who has spent years undermining experts, scientists, and trust in government, the pandemic has shown his weaknesses\n\nIt was just before 9am and the sky was overcast when a small group of reporters were suddenly ushered through the White House's south portico. They gathered in the diplomatic reception room, once home to Franklin Roosevelt's \"fireside chats\", and stared at a desk with pen, documents and the presidential seal.\n\nDonald Trump strode in, wearing a black bomber jacket and white shirt unbuttoned at the top, and settled down beneath a portrait of George Washington. He signed a congressional emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus for $8.3bn - more than three times what the president himself had requested - and held it up to a chorus of clicking cameras.\n\n\"We're doing very well,\" he insisted. \"But it's an unforeseen problem. What a problem. Came out of nowhere, but we're taking care of it.\" He gazed around the oval-shaped room, wallpapered romantic American landscapes, and took questions. Someone asked: \"How do you keep people from panicking?\" Trump's response in part: \"Calm. You have to be calm. It'll go away.\"\n\nIt has not gone away.\n\nA week later, coronavirus cases in the US have soared past 1,300, with at least 38 deaths. The stock market suffered its worst percentage drop since the 1987 Wall Street crash. On Wednesday night alone, Trump announced a travel ban on most of Europe during an Oval Office address, the National Basketball Association suspended its season and it emerged the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson had tested positive. The New York Post's front page headline declared: A world turned upside down.\n\nIt is at such moments of peril that a nation looks to its leader for reassurance and direction. Trump, critics say, has failed the test in both words and deeds. Uniquely unqualified, he is the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nElaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said: \"He's an idiot. He's handled it horribly. When things are rough, you want somebody who can exude confidence and competence and Trump does not do that.\n\n\"We've been incredibly lucky. For the last three years, there was nothing big going on that had a real bearing on the lives of the ordinary American. This does.\"\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak plays to the weaknesses of Trump, a germaphobe and gut instinct politician who prefers to slug it out with human foes on Twitter. He has spent years undermining experts, institutions, scientists, media outlets, global alliances and trust in government, all of which are now needed more than ever.\n\nHis first misstep came two years ago when he disbanded the global health security team on the National Security Council (NSC) that was responsible for preparing for a pandemic. The NSC's global health security chief, Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, was fired the day after an Ebola outbreak was declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year intelligence agencies warned that the US remained vulnerable to the next flu pandemic but Trump, it seems, hoped that his long streak of political luck would hold.\n\nDistracted by impeachment in January, the president showed little urgency when the coronavirus exploded in China, apparently unwilling to sour his relationship with authoritarian leader Xi Jinping, whom he praised for having the outbreak \"totally under control\" even as it raced across that country and beyond.\n\nThe White House did impose a limited travel ban on China but that alone was not enough. Former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler told the Politico website: \"They needed and still need to be searching for where the cases are, instead of trusting that limited travel bans were keeping out a virus that was probably already on the march.\"\n\nPerhaps Trump's greatest blunder was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization and taken up by many countries. The US government's own painfully slow progress led to a nationwide shortage of test kits at the most critical moment. It was reported that just 11,000 tests have been conducted in America so far, whereas South Korea is carrying out 10,000 tests per day.\n\nAshish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told the Bloomberg news agency: \"This is an unmitigated disaster that the administration has brought upon the population, and I don't say this lightly. We have had a much worse response than Iran, than Italy, than China and South Korea.\"\n\nIt seems that Trump only began to take the issue seriously two weeks ago when he saw a 1,000-point drop on Wall Street. Even then, he urged aides, including Kellyanne Conway and senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow, to go on television and preach confidence, according to five White House officials and Republicans interviewed by the Associated Press.\n\nTrump himself constantly downplayed the threat and contradicted his own health officials, asserting that the virus was \"very much under control\" and infections were \"going very substantially down, not up\". On 26 February, he confidently claimed that total cases will be \"close to zero\".\n\nHe also accused Democrats of using the coronavirus as \"their new hoax\", promised a vaccine much sooner than scientifically possible, prophesied that the virus will be killed off by warmer spring weather and kept comparing it to the common flu (though experts say coronavirus is 10 times more deadly). But the usual playbook of deny and distract proved futile against a nimble germ without an ego.\n\nRobert Shrum, a Democratic strategist and political science professor at the University of Southern California, said: \"Before it happened, he dismantled a lot of the preparedness that had been put in place under Obama and Ron Klain [Ebola czar] and Joe Biden, I suppose because they were things Obama had done so he wanted to get rid of them, like the Paris climate accords.\n\n\"And since then he has over and over again contradicted his own health people and at one point tried to muzzle them. He called the coronavirus 'a Democratic hoax' and then they ran out to explain, 'No, no, the hoax was that they were blaming Trump for not handling it well'. Well, I think almost universally people would say Trump has not handled this well.\"\n\nEven if Trump tried to dismiss the health statistics, he could not ignore the financial markets, an obsession he has made central to his reelection. He put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of a coronavirus task force, demoting Health Secretary Alex Azar, but continued to get in the way of the message.\n\nSoon after signing the congressional funding bill last Friday, Trump donned a \"Keep America great\" campaign cap and visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. In remarks that many found confounding and frightening, he described the governor of Washington state as a \"snake\", praised his own expertise and falsely claimed that anyone who wants a coronavirus test can get one. Pence was later forced to correct this.\n\nBut on Monday the full horror of the economic implications dawned on Trump as he flew from Florida to Washington on Air Force One. In his on-board office, Fox News showed graphics illustrating the single day for markets since the financial crisis of 2008. Fellow passenger Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman, had isolated himself in part of the plane after learning he had come into contact with an infected person.\n\nTrump travelled to Capitol Hill for lunch with Senate Republicans on Tuesday. He promised: \"We're doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\" A day later, Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the government's top public health experts, testified: \"Bottom line, it's going to get worse.\"\n\nThe president tried to provide further reassurance in only his second Oval Office address on Wednesday night. But it had the exact opposite effect. He blindsided European governments by announcing a 30-day travel ban to keep out the \"foreign virus\". He also failed to explain how tests will become available and committed factual errors the White House was forced to hastily correct.\n\nSusan Rice, former national security adviser, tweeted simply: \"OMG.\"\n\nEight months from a presidential election, the virus has jeopardised Trump's central reelection argument - a strong economy - just as Joe Biden, the candidate emerging from the Democratic field, seems poised to take advantage by offering stability and a safe pair of hands.\n\nMichael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \"The most calming and reassuring presidential voice of the past 24 hours has been Joe Biden. As a Republican, this is hard for me to say but it's true.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is being described as a once-in-a-lifetime event. History remembers how presidents handle such crises - and to Trump, it seems unlikely to be kind. He may be regarded as a Nero, fiddling while Rome burned.\n\nMoe Vela, a former senior adviser to Biden, said: \"He is unable to express compassion and empathy; I don't believe he possesses those two values. This was his chance to show that he could lead, to show that he was as tough as he said he was for three years. And then what does he do? He falls on his face.\"\n\nVela, an LGBTQ and Latino activist and board director at TransparentBusiness, added: \"We're walking around in ghost towns. Kids aren't going to school. Not enough people are getting tested. We have no clue what the reality of this pandemic is because information is being withheld and reaction from this administration was slow at best. It's disgusting. It's disconcerting. It's scary as hell.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_smith@theguardian.com", "name": "David Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fireside chats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive Order 13769"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

symptoms - scientists", "body": "The majority of coronavirus infections may be spread by people who have recently caught the virus and have not yet begun to show symptoms, scientists have found.\n\nAn analysis of infections in Singapore and Tianjin in China revealed that two-thirds and three-quarters of people respectively appear to have caught it from others who were incubating the virus but still symptom-free.\n\nThe finding has dismayed infectious disease researchers as it means that isolating people once they start to feel ill will be far less effective at slowing the pandemic than had been hoped.\n\n\"This is one of the first things we were worried about when the outbreak began,\" said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the work. \"It was certainly unhoped for. This is one thing we really didn't want to go this way.\"\n\nResearchers in Belgium and the Netherlands drew on data from outbreaks in Singapore and Tianjin to work out the \"generation interval\" for Covid-19. The generation interval is the time between one person getting infected and them infecting another. The figure is valuable for estimating the speed at which an outbreak will unfold.\n\nThe mean generation interval was 5.2 days in the Singapore cluster and 3.95 days in the China cluster, according to the analysis which is under review at an infectious disease journal. The scientists went on to calculate what proportion of infections were likely spread from people who were still incubating the virus and had yet to develop symptoms.\n\nThere are uncertainties in the figures because the scientists did not have precise information on who infected whom in the two clusters of disease. But even the lowest estimates show there was substantial transmission of coronavirus from people who had yet to fall ill.\n\nIn the Singapore cluster, between 45% and 84% of infections appeared to come from people incubating the virus. In China, the figures ranged from 65% to as much as 87%.\n\nTapiwa Ganyani, a researcher on the team, said the numbers suggest that isolating sick people would not be enough to quell the outbreak. \"It is unlikely that these measures alone will suffice to control the Covid-19 epidemic,\" he said. \"Additional measures, such as social distancing, are required.\"\n\nThe finding confirms recent comments from Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the World Health Organization's emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, who said preliminary data showed patients shed more virus in the early stages of the disease, including when presymptomatic. A separate study that tracked nine patients in Germany found that levels of the virus might already be in decline when symptoms come on.\n\n\"The number helps us estimate how likely certain kinds of public health interventions are to work,\" said Riley. \"If you ask people to go home when they feel ill and they have infected half the people they are going to infect before they feel ill, then you know you are not going to get rid of those transmissions.\" But he said it was still important to isolate those with symptoms, even if it would not be enough to stop the outbreak.\n\nGanyani stresses that the study looked at outbreaks where quarantine and other containment measures were already in place, which inflates the proportion of infections from presymptomatic people. \"If control measures are less strict you would expect this estimate to be lower, but the number of secondary cases to be higher on average,\" he said.\n\nRowland Kao, who studies infectious disease dynamics at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"One of the factors that has distinguished this coronavirus pandemic from the Sars epidemic in 2003, is that Sars was infectious only after the development of clinical signs, which made it relatively easier to control. For the current pandemic, from very early on it was suspected that a substantial number of transmissions were arising before clinical signs appeared.\n\n\"What is important to know is that, in their analysis, isolation can play an important and possibly crucial role but needs to be supplemented by other measures,\" he added.\n\nAdditional reporting by Hannah Devlin", "source": {"uri":

"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address", "title": "'He's gonna get us all killed': sense of unease after Trump coronavirus speech", "body": "Donald Trump's first Oval Office address - that almost sacred altar for US presidents on prime time television - came in January 2019 amid a partial government shutdown and asserted that only a border wall can keep out dangerous illegal immigrants.\n\nHis second such address on Wednesday night was again couched in terms around the need to resist a foreign invasion that is someone else's fault. The problem is that the coronavirus is already inside America and spreading.\n\nAnd the message was delivered by a 73-year-old man with a sniffing habit who did not seem to be a glowing picture of health nor entirely at ease reading from a TelePrompter. His bold assertion last week - \"I like this stuff. I really get it ... Maybe I have a natural ability.\" - seemed even more incredible than before.\n\nAddresses to the nation from the Oval Office are meant to be defining moments for a president to act as commander in chief or consoler in chief. After the crew of the space shuttle Challenger perished in a disaster in 1986, Ronald Reagan promised: \"We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God'.\"\n\nGeorge W Bush made half a dozen Oval Office addresses, including on the night of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Barack Obama delivered three. Trump has typically resisted conventions - it has been exactly a year since the last White House press briefing - but even he finds some of them necessary or useful.\n\nOn Wednesday he wore a blue suit, white shirt and blue patterned tie - not his favourite red. He also sported a stars and stripes pin and had hands his folded before him (he said nothing about the potential perils of shaking hands). His face looked undeniably orange. Behind him were framed photos, including portraits of his parents, and flags and gold curtains.\n\nAt 9.02pm, Trump began as presidents so often do: \"My fellow Americans.\" But in the next breath, he reverted to his familiar us-versus-them nationalism, referring to the coronavirus outbreak \"that started in China\" and is now spreading throughout the world. \"This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.\" Not just a virus. A foreign virus.\n\nThe president touted his own sweeping travel restrictions on China and, far from expressing sympathy and solidarity with allies, argued the European Union \"failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\"\n\nTrump announced the US will bebanning travelers from many European countries to the US for the next 30 days with exemptions for Americans, permanent residents and family of US citizens who have undergone screenings and, mysteriously, the UK, despite it having a higher caseload than some other European countries. Could Brexit be the new TSA PreCheck?\n\nThe president then made an awful bungle. He said \"these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval\". Such words could trigger global economic panic. Trump was forced to hastily clarify on Twitter: \"... very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.\"\n\nHe went on to talk of the pathogen as if it was a foreign army or terrorist network. \"The virus will not have a chance against us,\" he said. \"No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.\"\n\nAnd seen in the midst of an emergency, Trump could not resist some campaigning. \"Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world by far,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.\"\n\nMany observers found the address unreassuring and downright weird. Susan Glasser, a staff writer from the New Yorker, tweeted: \"The militaristic, nationalistic language of Trump's speech tonight is striking: a 'foreign virus,' keeping out China and Europe.\"\n\nDavid Litt, who wrote speeches for Obama, posted: \"As a former presidential speechwriter, my careful rhetorical analysis is that he's gonna get us all killed.\"\n\nTrump's second Oval Office address was over in 10 minutes. Then a man off camera said: \"We're clear.\" The president unbuttoned his jacket and exclaimed with relief: \"OK!\"\n\nTo millions of viewers, it was anything but.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_smith@theguardian.com", "name": "David Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018\u201319_United_States_federal_government_shutdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2018\u201319 United States federal government shutdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_barrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States barrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle Challenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teleprompter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

There was no specific advice for how older people should protect themselves, aside from avoiding going on cruises.\n\nOn Friday, the World Health Organization stressed the need for a range of measures to tackle the virus, which is thought to have infected up to 10,000 people in the UK, most of them unknowingly because they are not showing any symptoms.\n\nThe WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said all possible action should be taken: \"Not testing alone. Not contact tracing alone. Not quarantine alone. Not social distancing alone. Do it all.\"\n\nHours later, in a significant change of tack, Downing Street signalled it was preparing to stop large public events, including sports fixtures and concerts, to alleviate the pressure on police and the ambulance service. It did not specify what size of event would be affected, and the timing of the clampdown has yet to be decided, but it is expected to come into force in a week's time.\n\nEmergency legislation due to be passed by the government next week is expected to include compensation for organisations forced to cancel events.\n\nWhitehall sources said the country would move toward widespread home-working, although details had yet to be thrashed out.\n\nScores of events had already been cancelled unilaterally, as firms and institutions made their own assessments of the risk. There was a series of announcements earlier on Friday about care homes closing their doors to visitors, sporting and cultural fixtures being suspended, and universities ending in-person lectures.\n\nIn what is thought to be an unprecedented step, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen would cancel public engagements in Cheshire and London next week \"as a sensible precaution\". Visits from the monarch, who is 94, draw crowds of well-wishers and use local council resources.\n\nA large number of care homes, including 120 run by Bupa, announced they would close their doors to outside visitors to protect elderly residents, despite updated government guidance suggesting that only those with virus symptoms should be turned away.\n\nThe Premier League, Football League, Women's Super League and Scottish Premier League joined the global sporting shutdown. The English leagues were suspended until 3 April at least, Saturday's Six Nations clash between Wales and Scotland was postponed, and England's cricket series in Sri Lanka was called off. The London Marathon and The Masters in Augusta - golf's leading tournament - were also postponed.\n\nIn the US, Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday. He told reporters afterwards that the ban on European travel to the US could be extended to include the UK. He said the exemption had been \"recommended to me by a group of professionals\" but he said the UK's rising number of cases could result in a rethink. \"Their numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours so we may be adding them [to the ban] and we may be adding a couple of others and we may frankly start thinking about taking some off.\"\n\nOther developments included:\n\nLocal and mayoral elections due to be held in May were postponed for 12 months, although the government insisted the timetable for Brexit deal negotiations would not be derailed.\n\nHospitals were trebling the size of their intensive care units and preparing to delay millions of non-urgent procedures, including some surgery for people with heart and lung conditions.\n\nThe World Health Organization stressed that countries should track and test every case of coronavirus to stop the pandemic, a day after the UK announced that only the most seriously ill in hospitals would be tested.\n\nAs the WHO described Europe as the new centre of the pandemic, Britons were urged against all but essential travel to Spain and Italy; the Eiffel Tower was closed.\n\nJohnson has been facing increasing questions about the government's approach, which is markedly different to that of some other countries. The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt described the UK as an \"outlier\".\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson played down the importance of banning mass gatherings, even suggesting Scotland's decision to ban events with more than 500 people reflected the lack of resilience of its emergency services.\n\n\"The scientific advice, as we've said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread,\" he said.\n\nThe government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, defended the approach on Friday, saying it was aimed at creating a \"herd immunity\" against Covid-19. That means allowing 60% of the population to catch the virus, but not so quickly as to overwhelm the NHS.\n\n\"Our aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely. Also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, [our aim is] to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission, [while] at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable to it. Those are the key things we need to do,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, the number of diagnosed cases in the UK rose to 798, though the government believes the true figure to be 5,000 to 10,000, and the first death was confirmed in Scotland.\n\nThe former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown has criticised the lack of a coordinated international response, urging global leaders to pledge to do \"whatever it takes,\" to tackle the outbreak.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, he likened the scale of the response necessary to the Manhattan Project, which led to the creation of the nuclear bomb. \"If the Manhattan Project could bring people together in the 1940s to create the most lethal weapon in human history, surely we can come together in the 21st century to save lives and the livelihood of millions.\"\n\nBrown blamed the spread of \"populist nationalism\", which has been \"subdividing our world\", for the inability of governments to deal with the crisis together. He encouraged them to be more open about how they were learning from each other's experiences.\n\nHis plea came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced that world leaders will hold an emergency G7 video-conference summit on Monday. \"We will coordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatments, and work on an economic and financial response,\" he said.\n\nGlobal stock markets rallied on Friday after their worst day since the 1987 crash, on hopes that economic policymakers might deliver a coordinated response.\n\nIn the UK, ministers have insisted their decision-making is based on scientific advice. One factor influencing their thinking has been the risk of \"fatigue\" setting in if restrictive measures had to be applied for a prolonged period.\n\nLabour has been broadly supportive of the government's approach so far but the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, demanded more information.\n\n\"We're supporting to the move from the contain to delay stage, but the government needs an explain stage,\" he said. \"We have a duty to voice the concerns that are being raised with us: and the public want to know why the UK appears to be taking an approach which is different to other countries, when other countries themselves are saying their approach is based on their science.\"\n\nA Whitehall source said: \"Ministers are working with the chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer on our plan to stop various types of public events, including mass gatherings, beginning next week. We are also talking to businesses and other bodies about the timing of moving towards much more widespread working from home.\n\n\"There are many complex considerations to make all these measures as effective as possible. We will make the right decisions at the right time based on the best scientific evidence.\n\n\"For example, we are concerned about the burden large events put on public services - including the health service and the police - from dealing with coronavirus. Officials are working with industry bodies to identify how to support businesses that will be affected by this decision.\n\n\"We have drafted emergency legislation to give the government the powers it needs to deal with coronavirus, including powers to stop mass gatherings and compensate organisations. We will publish this legislation next week.\"\n\nParliament announced a clampdown on visitors, and urged MPs not to go on overseas visits. Members of the public would be able to watch debates from the public galleries, but not tour the parliamentary estate.\n\nThe Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said: \"We are clear that now is the time to be pragmatic; everyone in the country is being asked to strike a balance and it is right that we do the same.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

As a tactic in fighting a pandemic for which there is no vaccine, it is novel - and some say alarming.\n\nIt relies on people getting the disease - in this case Covid-19 - and becoming immune as a result. Generally it is thought that those who recover will be immune, at least for now, so they won't get it twice.\n\nBut allowing the population to build up immunity in this way - rather than through widespread testing, tracking down the contacts of every case and isolating them, as many other countries in Asia and Europe have chosen to do - could increase the risk to the most vulnerable: older people with underlying health problems.\n\nTo reach herd immunity, about 60% of the population would need to get ill and become immune, according to Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser. Though it could need as much as 70% or more. Even scientists who understand the strategy are anxious. \"I do worry that making plans that assume such a large proportion of the population will become infected (and hopefully recovered and immune) may not be the very best that we can do,\" said Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\n\n\"Another strategy might be to try to contain [it] longer and perhaps long enough for a therapy to emerge that might allow some kind of treatment. This seems to be the strategy of countries such as Singapore. While this containment approach is clearly difficult (and may be impossible for many countries), it does seem a worthy goal; and those countries that can should aim to do.\"\n\nThe government's \"nudge unit\" seems to favour this strategy. Dr David Halpern, a psychologist who heads the Behavioural Insights Team, said on BBC News: \"There's going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you'll want to cocoon, you'll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don't catch the disease and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity's been achieved in the rest of the population.\"\n\nBut Anthony Costello, a paediatrician and former World Health Organization director, said that the UK government was out of kilter with other countries in looking to herd immunity as the answer. It could conflict with WHO policy, he said in a series of Twitter posts, which is to contain the virus by tracking and tracing all cases. He quoted Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, who said: \"The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\"\n\nHerd immunity might not even last, Costello said. \"Does coronavirus cause strong herd immunity or is it like flu where new strains emerge each year needing repeat vaccines? We have much to learn about Co-V immune responses.\" Vaccines, he said, were a much safer way of bringing it about.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

closure is being planned for the rest of the UK.\n\nFoster confirmed that schools in Northern Ireland would close at some point in an effort to stem the spread of the virus but it was a matter of timing.\n\n\"I am taking my advice from the Northern Ireland chief medical officer. He is advising schools should not close yet,\" she said, warning that nonetheless schools and parents should prepare for closure, adding: \"I think they will be closed for at least 16 weeks.\"\n\nShe was under pressure to close schools in line with the republic of Ireland's decision last week but said she was taking the continued advice of the UK's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the timing was not right.\n\nA four-month closure will impose a huge burden on the economy with parents forced to find a way to work at home and educational institutes suddenly trying to launch a whole term of remote learning. It will also raise questions about the viability of exams in May and June.\n\nFoster was speaking after a meeting with Varadkar to discuss a cross-border approach to combating coronavirus.\n\nAlso at the meeting were their deputies, Michelle O'Neill and Simon Coveney, and the two executives' health ministers and chief medical officers.\n\nAt a press conference, she said the \"cooperation\" between the two sides \"could not be any better\".\n\nVarakdar warned that Covid-19 was an illness \"that knows no borders\" as administrations on either side of the border follow different strategies.\n\n\"There is very good cooperation already between the chief medical officers and the government and the executive.\n\n\"There will be differences of approach over the next few weeks and months; we are different jurisdictions ... but the differences that exist are mostly around timing,\" he said.\n\n\"But what isn't different is our common objective, which is to slow down the virus in its tracks, push it back,\" he added.\n\nThey discussed school closures, travel and supply chains at the meeting, which convened under the north-south ministerial council framework mandated by the Belfast/Good Friday agreement.\n\nBoth Simon Harris, the Irish health minister, and his counterpart in the Northern Ireland executive, Robin Swann, said it would be wrong for the public to think that governments could make \"big\" or \"bold\" decisions to protect the public against coronavirus.\n\nThe most effective decision was for the public to be \"compliant\" and change their behaviour, said Swann.\n\nCoveney said he had on Friday night issued advice to Irish nationals to be cautious about travelling to the rest of the EU but this did not include the UK.\n\nIn a joint statement after the meeting, the Irish governments said: \"It was agreed that everything possible will be done in coordination and cooperation between the Irish government and the Northern Ireland executive and with the active involvement of the health administrations in both jurisdictions to tackle the outbreak. Protection of the lives and welfare of everyone on the island is paramount, and no effort will be spared in that regard.\"\n\nNine new coronavirus cases were recorded in Northern Ireland on Friday, bringing the total to 29.

pandemic, warning that countries are not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus around the globe.\n\nThe WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said \"pandemic\" was not a word to use carelessly or lightly, but 4,291 people had died and thousands more were fighting for for their lives in hospital.\n\n\"In the days and weeks ahead we expect to see the many cases, the many deaths and the number of affected countries climb even higher,\" he said.\n\nBy reversing course and using the charged word \"pandemic\", which it had previously shied away from, the UN health agency appeared to want to shock lethargic countries into increasing their efforts to combat the outbreak.\n\n\"We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear,\" Ghebreyesus said. \"We are deeply concerned by both alarming levels of spread and severity and by alarming levels of inaction.\"\n\nHe called on countries to take urgent and aggressive action against the pandemic, insisting that the impact could still be controlled. \"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic. If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilise their people in the response,\" he said.\n\nThe WHO added that Iran and Italy were the new front lines of the battle against the virus that started in China.\n\n\"They're suffering but I guarantee you other countries will be in that situation soon,\" said Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO's emergencies chief.\n\nIn Italy, where the death toll rose by 31% in 24 hours, to 827, the government began considering imposing even tighter restrictions on daily life and announced billions of euros in financial relief to cushion economic shock.\n\nIn Iran, by far the hardest-hit country in the Middle East, the senior vice-president and two other cabinet ministers were reported to have been diagnosed with Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. Iran reported another sharp rise in the number of deaths, by 62 to 354, behind only China and Italy.\n\nFor most, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

Anyone who had any symptoms should self-isolate at home for seven days, without notifying the NHS.\n\nBanning mass gatherings would not help reduce the spread of infections, the prime minister and his advisers said - although it now seems likely, largely in response to sporting and entertainment bodies cancelling events of their own accord.\n\nAnthony Costello, a UK paediatrician and former director of the World Health Organization (WHO), said he had personally written to the chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, asking for testing to continue in the community.\n\n\"The key principles from WHO are intensive surveillance,\" he told the Guardian. \"You test the population like crazy, find out where the cases are, immediately quarantine them and do contact tracing and get them out of the community. This deals with family clusters. That's the key bedrock of getting this under control.\"\n\nThis was how South Korea, China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan had brought their case numbers down. \"You can really take people out of the population and make sure they are quarantined. That is vital - before you get to social distancing.\"\n\nYet the UK government was stopping tests outside of hospital. \"For me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy. It would mean it just lets rip,\" he said.\n\nCostello thinks we will be in the same position as Italy within two weeks. \"The basic public health approach is playing second fiddle to mathematical modelling,\" he said.\n\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director general, expressed his deep concern on Friday at the end of testing and contact tracing in the UK and some other European countries.\n\n\"You can't fight a virus if you don't know where it is,\" he said. \"Find, isolate, test and treat every case to break the chains of Covid transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.\"\n\nDevi Sridhar, professor of global public health at Edinburgh, listed on Twitter the reasons for continuing to test. \"1 People can alter behaviour based on whether they have Covid. 2 Break chains of transmission. 3 Local hospitals can plan for how many patients will need care. 4 To know where cases are emerging (hotspots). 5 How do we know how large problem is?\"\n\nA government minister in Singapore has also expressed dismay. \"One concern we have with cases such as UK and Switzerland isn't just about the numbers. It is that these countries have abandoned any measure to contain or restrain the virus,\" minister for national development, Lawrence Wong, said at a press briefing on Sunday. \"If there's no attempt to contain, we estimate the number of cases in these countries to rise significantly in the coming days and weeks.\"\n\nAn open letter from a group including some of the UK's most senior doctors asked the government to publish the modelling and any other evidence for the policies it is pursuing. \"Our country's public health response to Covid-19 is demonstrably different to most other countries' responses globally and in Europe ... There is also no clear indication that the UK's response is being informed by experiences of other countries in containing the spread of Covid-19,\" it said, pointing out the risks to the NHS of a rapid and huge surge in cases of people needing hospital treatment. The UK has 2.5 beds per 1,000 people in the population, they said, which is fewer than France (6), Italy (3.2) and the United States (2.8).\n\nImmunologists, in a separate open letter, said they had \"significant questions\" about the government's apparent strategy to rely on building up \"herd immunity\" by exposure to the virus in the UK. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has suggested this might be a good outcome from many people becoming infected.\n\nHerd immunity is usually brought about by vaccination - not exposing people to the risks of a disease. \"The ultimate aim of herd immunity is to stop disease spread and protect the most vulnerable in society. However, this strategy only works to reduce serious disease if, when building that immunity, vulnerable individuals are protected from becoming ill, for example through social distancing. If not, the consequences could be severe,\" says the letter from the British Society for Immunology.\n\nBehavioural scientists joined the concern, saying they believed the government should immediately bring in social distancing measures and not delay for fear of the public getting \"behavioural fatigue\".\n\n\"If 'behavioural fatigue' truly represents a key factor in the government's decision to delay high-visibility interventions, we urge the government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision. If one is lacking, we urge the government to reconsider these decisions,\" wrote Prof Ulrike Hahn from Birkbeck, University of London, and others.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

lasting four weeks could cut 3% from the UK's GDP, costing the economy billions of pounds, according to research being considered by the government as it weighs up the benefits and risks of shutting down classrooms.\n\nAdvisers at the Department for Education and No 10 are examining a range of options from complete closure of all schools and colleges in England, which would affect around 7 million children, to more nuanced policies.\n\nMeasures being looked at include those effected in Japan, where schools sent home individual classes and age groups when a certain percentage of children were infected, and Austria, where elementary schools have stayed open to effectively act as daycare for the children of essential workers. Belgium has followed a similar path. Other countries have closed all schools.\n\nShutting schools would mean that millions of families would have to find childcare, causing gaps in the workforce as parents stay at home. That would worsen the economic impact and affect essential workers on the frontline: 47% of GPs in England and Wales are aged 30-45, the age group most likely to have school-aged children, and so would face a scramble for childcare lasting many weeks.\n\nThe pressure to close schools has mounted as other European governments have enacted different policies. Over the past week, Greece, Poland and Denmark announced national school closures, then Ireland and France followed on Thursday, along with much of Spain, and Belgium on Friday, leaving the UK more isolated. Schools in Germany remain open other than in a few hotspots, although that is expected to change early next week.\n\nAnnouncing limited new measures to tackle coronavirus on Thursday, Boris Johnson told a press conference: \"We are not - repeat not - closing schools now. The scientific advice is it will do more harm than good at this time, but of course we're keeping an open view and may change this as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically told to do so.\"\n\nGovernment advisors believe that closures would have to be at least 13 weeks long to reduce the peak of Covid-19 by 10%-15%, and there are concerns that children out of school would end up socialising anyway or spending time with grandparents, who are at greater risk from the virus.\n\nThe advisers admit that economic considerations are an inevitable part of calculations. They have been attempting to model the impact of school closures on the spread of Covid-19, with mixed results.\n\nSimon Wren-Lewis, an emeritus professor of economics at Oxford who co-authored a study of past influenza pandemics, has estimated direct losses caused by the illness to be 1% to 2% of output, measured by gross domestic product (GDP) - which would multiply if schools were closed for extended periods.\n\n\"School closures can amplify the reduction in labour supply if some workers are forced to take time off to look after children. On the basis of the assumptions we made, if schools close for around four weeks, that can multiply the GDP impacts by as much as a factor of three, and if they close for a whole quarter, by twice that.\n\n\"If that seems large, remember nationwide school closures impact everyone with children and not just those with the disease,\" Wren-Lewis wrote.\n\n\"But even with all schools closed for three months and many people avoiding work when they were not sick, the largest impact we got for GDP loss over a year was less than 5%. That is a one-quarter very severe recession but there is no reason why the economy cannot bounce back to full strength once the pandemic is over.\"\n\nSpeaking at a conference of headteachers in Birmingham on Friday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, stressed the government's case for keeping schools in England open, while most of Britain's European neighbours closed theirs.\n\n\"The chief medical officer has said the impact of closing schools on children's education will be substantial, but the benefit to public health would not be. The government is particularly mindful of the strain on public services like the NHS that would be caused by key workers having to stay home to look after their children as a result of school closures,\" he said.\n\nWilliamson said that position could change, depending on the view of the government's scientific and medical advisers.\n\nInside Whitehall, policymakers and civil servants are wrestling with conflicting evidence from different countries during the current coronavirus outbreak, as well as research that school closures have appeared to slow the transmission of disease among children and their families in previous pandemics.\n\n\"This isn't some clever Oxbridge tutorial, it's a real thing that politicians and civil servants are having to face right now,\" said one external consultant who has been advising the government on its public health policies.\n\nSeveral leading British universities have also pre-empted the government. The London School of Economics announced an end to in-person lectures and exams for the rest of the academic year, medical schools have cancelled clinical exams for trainee doctors, and a growing number of international students have left their courses to return to their home countries.\n\nThe push to close schools is based on lessons from previous influenza epidemics, when it was seen to have softened the impact. But in those cases children were also at greater risk from disease, making the public health risks more acute. The government's policymakers caution that Covid-19 appears to be less of a direct danger to children, so the sole value of closures would be to help with \"social distancing\".", "source": {"uri":

staff describe immense pressure and war-like conditions in fight to treat patients\n\nA nurse on the frontline of Italy's coronavirus outbreak has described the experience as \"war-like\".\n\nDoctors and nurses are working around the clock as the country tries to halt the spread of a virus that has so far claimed over 1000 Italian lives.\n\nAmong the dead was a 59-year-old doctor and close friend of Roberta Re, a nurse at Piacenza hospital in Emilia-Romagna, the region with the second highest number of cases.\n\n\"It's an experience I would compare to a world war,\" Re told the Guardian. \"But it's a war that isn't fightable with traditional arms - as we don't yet know who the enemy is and so it's difficult to fight. The only weapon we do have to avoid things getting even worse is to stay at home and to respect the rules, to do what they did in China, as this is paying off.\"\n\nItaly, which has had the worst coronavirus outbreak outside of China, tightened quarantine restrictions on Thursday after the death toll leapt. The total number of people infected since the epidemic began, including the deaths and those who have recovered, reached over 15,000 on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm usually a happy person, chatting and joking with everyone ... but now there are days when I have cried and been depressed,\" added Re.\n\nOther medics at the centre of the outbreak have made harrowing pleas over social media, and have shared images of exhausted staff as their hospitals buckle under the pressure. Andrea Vercelli, who works in the emergency unit at Piacenza hospital, said in a Facebook video: \"What we are experiencing is not a normal flu, we are getting 40 cases a day of pneumonia in the emergency room.\"\n\nDaniele Macchini, a doctor at Humanitas Gavazzeni hospital in the badly-affected province of Bergamo in the Lombardy region, wrote on Facebook a few days before the entire country was quarantined: \"The situation is nothing short of dramatic. The war has literally exploded and the battle is uninterrupted, day and night.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Codacons, Italy's main consumer association, has asked prosecutors in Bergamo to investigate after an anaesthetist in the intensive care unit at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital told the newspaper Corriere della Sera that the pressure was so immense that saving a life \"is decided by age and health conditions ... as in situations of war\".\n\n\"In no case can age be a discriminating factor when it comes to public health, and it certainly cannot be a criteria to decide who to treat and who not to treat,\" Carlo Rienzi, the president of Codacons, said in a statement. \"A shortage of beds must not lead to choices like those described by the doctor.\"\n\nThe virus has infected many doctors and nurses as they worked. Roberto Stella, the president of the order of doctors in Varese, Lombardy, died on Wednesday. The 67-year-old was tending to patients until he started to suffer symptoms and went into intensive care himself last Friday.\n\n\"He died a hero, like other colleagues who have died in recent days,\" Saverio Chiaravalle, vice-president of the Varese doctors order, told Corriere della Sera.\n\nPrime minister Giuseppe Conte repeated his call for Italians to \"stay at home\" as he announced the closure of shops, bars and restaurants across the country on Wednesday in an additional step to try and contain the virus.\n\n\"People need to understand that the situation is very serious,\" said Re. \"The fundamental thing is to close everything, as well as to educate adolescents to have a concept of how serious this is.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

"Coronavirus live updates: Italy under lockdown as WHO says threat of pandemic 'very real'", "body": "Markets rally after Donald Trump announces 'major' economic measures\n\nThe US President said his administration is proposing measures including working with hourly wage earners to ensure they can take time off and creating loans for small businesses so they can weather the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"This is something we were thrown into and we have been handling it\", Trump said.\n\nMarkets rallied in response:\n\nIn the US, passengers are expected to start disembarking the Grand Princess cruise ship, which has 21 confirmed cases of coronavirus, mostly among crew members, on board.\n\nThe cruise ship was forced to idle for days off the coast of California because of the cluster cases. It arrived in port on Monday as state and US officials prepared to transfer its thousands of passengers to military bases for quarantine or return them to their home countries.\n\nWhen the ship pulled into the Port of Oakland near San Francisco with more than 3,500 people aboard, passengers lining the balconies waved and some left the cabins where they had been in isolation to go onto deck as the ship entered the port near San Francisco, AP reports.\n\nWorkers wearing gloves and yellow protective gear have placed a large tent by a platform where passengers will disembark. At least 20 buses and five ambulances are parked nearby, and officials have said those needing acute medical care for any reason will get off first.\n\nWe'll have more updates shortly.\n\nOn the lockdown in Italy, WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus voiced hope that drastic measures taken there could help rein in the virus, and would give less-affected countries more time to prepare for a wider spread.\n\nBut he acknowledged that \"the disease has not run its course\".\n\n\"Right now I think we are still very much in the beginning or middle... of this fight,\" he said, warning against complacency towards the virus.\n\nAs for the word pandemic, \"I am not worried about the word, I am more worried about what the world's reaction to the word will be,\" Tedros told reporters.\n\nHe also slammed those who might suggest simply letting the virus run its course, pointing out that for the elderly and weak especially \"it is very fatal.\"\n\n\"If anything is going to hurt the world it is a moral decay, and not taking the deaths of the elderly or senior citizens\" seriously, he said.\n\n\"Pandemic doesn't mean that we say it is fine to live with it... we can contain it,\" he said.\n\n\"No white flag. We don't give up.\"\n\n\"Pandemic\" is not an official WHO term, and it does not trigger any specific actions. WHO has already put out its highest level of alert - saying the world is at \"high risk\"\n\nThe World Health Organization warned Monday \"the threat of a pandemic has become very real,\" but stressed the virus could still be controlled. The WHO defines a pandemic as a situation in which \"the whole world's population would likely be exposed to this infection and potentially a proportion of them fall sick,\" Michael Ryan, who heads the WHO's emergencies programme, has said.\n\nInfections worldwide have passed 110,000.\n\nBut he stressed, \"even if we call it a pandemic, still we can contain it and control it.\n\n\"It would be the first pandemic in history that can be controlled,\" he said. \"We are not at the mercy of the virus.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the situation varied widely in the 100-odd countries that have so far registered cases, with 93% of all cases being located in just four countries.\n\n\"Whether it is pandemic or not, the rule of the game is the same: never give up,\" he said.\n\nHe said 79 countries had registered fewer than 100 cases, and more than half of those had seen fewer than 10 infections.\n\nAt the same time, in China, where more than 80,000 cases have been recorded since the outbreak began there in December, the country appears to be \"bringing the epidemic under control,\" Tedros said.\n\n\"More than 70% have recovered and have been discharged,\" he pointed out.\n\nSince the novel coronavirus first emerged, 113,582 cases have been recorded across 100 countries, killing 3,996 people, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nHello, and welcome to our new coronavirus blog.\n\nMarkets have reacted positively to an announcement by US president Donald Trump of 'major' new economic measures in response to the crisis. The whole of Italy is in lockdown. In California, passengers are today expected to begin disembarking the Grand Princess cruise ship. Stay with us for the latest.\n\nHere is a summary of the latest recent developments.\n\nThe US and UK stock markets have both suffered their worst daily slump since the 2008 financial crisis. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has plunged by more than 2,000 points, closing down 7.8% tonight. More than 60 million were placed in lockdown conditions in Italy as the measures imposed on the northern \"red zone\" were extended to the whole country. The steps announced by the Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte included the suspension of all public gatherings and strict travel restrictions. Australia's Qantas airline has reduced its international flying capacity by a quarter, grounding eight Airbus A380s, and leaving just two of the largest planes in its fleet flying. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison is due to reveal part of his government's plan to protect the economy from a recession caused by the coronavirus. Egypt has placed a nationwide suspension on \"any large gatherings of citizens, or those that involve the movement of citizens between governorates,\" its prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, has announced.\n\nBoris Johnson has urged people to not panic buy, to \"behave responsibly\" and think of others. More than 60 million were placed in lockdown conditions in Italy as the measures imposed on the northern \"red zone\" were extended to the whole country. The steps announced by the Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte included the suspension of all public gatherings and strict travel restrictions. Anyone arriving in the UK from Italy should self-isolate for two weeks, UK officials warned. Within a fortnight the UK government will advise anyone with a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection to self-isolate for seven days. Egypt announced similar measures aimed at countering the virus's spread.

"body": "Such is the reverse Midas touch of Donald Trump, that his attempt last night to face facts, steady nerves and reassure the public succeeded in spreading panic, sowing confusion and ratcheting up the anxiety.\n\nThe fact that Trump delivered a rare, live televised address to the nation should, by itself, have induced calm. It suggested that the president was moving out of fantasyland, abandoning the denial that had led him to promise a miracle was on the way and that the threat of coronavirus was likely to recede as soon as next month, when the weather got warmer. (As recently as Tuesday, he was saying, \"It will go away, just stay calm.\") That he was ready to deploy one of the US presidency's most powerful tools, usually reserved for moments of war or disaster - a TV address from the Oval Office - seemed to signal that he was, at last, facing reality.\n\nSure enough, when he referred to the virus as a \"horrible infection\", after weeks spent dismissing it as a glorified cold or flu, it fed the hope that Trump might finally be ready to acknowledge that his approach up until this moment had not worked - that this was not a problem that could be dealt with in the usual away, swatted aside with a tweet or by hanging a comic nickname around the neck of one of his enemies.\n\nBut no sooner had that hope appeared than it faded away. For in the course of nine minutes, Trump swiftly reverted to type. He described Covid-19 as a \"foreign virus\", and took pains to point out that \"a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe\". His doctrine of \"America first\" - a phrase he used once again - forever pits the US against the world, with its implication that America's purity is permanently under threat of contamination by alien hordes. Trump has used that imagery in the context of immigration for more than four years; it should hardly be a surprise that he uses it now in the context of disease.\n\nEqually in character was his preference for the vast, sweeping edict over the detailed, calibrated policy response. What the US needs most is a serious, extensive programme of testing. Currently, the US is bottom of the global league table for coronavirus testing, at a rate of just five people in every million. (South Korea is testing 3,692 people per million.) But that kind of announcement would require too much work, not least because Trump shut down the dedicated Obama-era, White House unit that had focused on preparedness against a global pandemic. It would be too dull and plodding for the man who made his name issuing orders on The Apprentice. Trump prefers the kingly diktat that makes instant headlines and good TV. In the 2016 campaign it was his call for a \"total and complete shutdown\" on Muslims entering the US. This time it was a ban on travellers from 26 European countries in the Schengen area, starting on Friday. Once again, the would-be medieval monarch was ordering the drawbridge pulled up against the foreign menace.\n\nHe surely hoped his subjects would be soothed by such a decisive show of leadership. But because this is Trump, his short speech was riddled with errors that had to be rapidly corrected - thereby spreading confusion rather than clarity. One example: he announced that his Europe ban would \"apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo\" across the Atlantic, prompting the White House to rush out a statement explaining that the president had got it wrong, and that the new policy would, in fact, only apply to people, not goods. If the plan was to project a White House coolly capable in the face of a crisis, that mix-up and Trump's halting discomfort in front of the teleprompter conveyed the precise opposite.\n\nAbove all, the new policy lacked rhyme or reason. Why keep out almost all Europeans, as if this problem is exclusive to Europe (and China), rather than global, and when the US has a rising infection problem all its own? And why exempt the UK, which is hardly coronavirus-free? There was no explanation, so speculation filled the vacuum. Could it be a politically motivated swipe at the EU, which Trump once said he regarded as the US's greatest \"foe\", pointedly giving preferential treatment to Brexit Britain? Was it driven by a motive as base as the fact that Trump has golf courses in the UK (and Ireland), and he didn't want to harm his own businesses? Or did it spring from a crudely racist worldview that divides the globe into a clean, acceptable Anglosphere set against a tainted, diseased \"abroad\"?\n\nWhatever the explanation, the address did not work. The clearest proof came in the metric Trump understands best and that terrifies him most, because he believes it holds the key to his prospects of re-election. The headline this morning: \"Stock markets tumble as Trump's Europe travel ban shocks investors\". Truly, he is Midas in reverse.\n\n* Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

panic-buy", "body": "Food banks in Britain are running out of staples including milk and cereal as a result of panic-buying and are urging shoppers to think twice before hoarding as donations fall in the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nDonations from shoppers at branches of Sainsbury's and Waitrose slumped to 25% of their normal volume at one food bank in London, while they have fallen by a third at a Kirkcaldy food bank - where UHT milk has run out. Some facilities have warned they may close because of concerns about cross-infection, and a food bank in Stonebridge, a deprived area of north-west London, will cut the size of its food parcels by a third from Wednesday, with larger families facing the biggest reductions.\n\n\"Panic is going to be more dangerous than the virus,\" said Joyce Leggate, the chair of Kirkcaldy food bank, which helps up to 350 families a week. \"Our food parcels are essential for the health of many of the people we support. The food can be a lifeline. Please, if you are stockpiling, have a look and say: 'Am I really going to use this?' If not, is there someone who needs it more?\"\n\nOrganisers in Fife, Liverpool and Leicester have reported the unavailability of UHT milk, a key part of their food parcels to keep young children and expecting mothers healthy.\n\nFood bank users are already noticing the impact. Over the weekend, one tweeted in response to a post about panic-buying: \"If you're lucky enough to have a few \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 left at the end of your food shop then please consider buying food or hygiene products to donate to foodbanks.\"\n\nFood banks in the UK gave out more than 1.6m parcels last year, based on figures for the Trussell Trust, which has 428 food banks in its network. Independent food banks typically rely on donations of food and money, using the cash to top up supplies by placing orders at supermarkets. Many have found that panic-buying by the public has made it impossible to buy the volumes of the staples they need, including tinned fish.\n\n\"Emergency food aid providers across the UK are already stretched to the limit and the impact of the spread of coronavirus can only make matters worse,\" said Sabine Goodwin, the coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network, which represents 189 food banks. \"[They] cannot be expected to support yet more people needing help if schools are closed and those depending on insecure work are forced to rely on charity if taken ill or self-isolating.\"\n\nFrank Field, the former MP for Birkenhead and veteran anti-poverty campaigner, called on Tuesday for \"each of us to reflect on whether that extra packet of pasta really is necessary for ourselves, or whether instead we can donate it to help families who are hungry now\".\n\nField, who chairs the charity Feeding Britain, which runs food poverty schemes in 12 areas of England, also called on the government to reduce the need for food banks - through the swift payment of universal credit and continuing to support free school dinners.\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, told parliament on Monday that self-employed and gig economy workers who stand to lose their incomes if they have to self-isolate \"can apply for universal credit or new-style employment and support allowance and advances are available for universal credit immediately\".\n\nPaul O'Brien, who runs the Micah Liverpool food bank, which helps feed more than 200 people a week, said: \"We are struggling to get UHT milk and breakfast cereals, which are basics in our food parcels. On Monday, our driver has been speaking to [supermarket] store managers explaining why we want to buy in bulk and he is getting no luck.\"\n\n\"People's concerns are elsewhere,\" said James Quayle, the manager at North Paddington food bank in London, where donations are down to 25% of their normal volume. \"It shows the safety net created by our food banks is very thin. The system is not very sustainable. This is another sign that more vulnerable people stand to be worse affected by coronavirus.\"\n\nQuayle's charity has increased its spending on food from \u00a3600 to \u00a3800 a week to try to compensate for the slump in donations.\n\nRajesh Makwana, the coordinator of the Sufra NW London food bank, said it may have to close to prevent cross-infection of users and is considering whether it can deliver parcels instead. He said users include refugees with connections to Iran or who have passed through Italy.\n\nRobin Burgess, who runs the Hope Food Centre in Northampton, which feeds lunch to 130 homeless people daily, said it is making preparations to close in the event of stricter rules from public health authorities about people mixing.\n\n\"We are teetering on the edge of banning communal gatherings,\" Burgess said. \"We are thinking about possibly using a car park with a marquee where people can get food and go away.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

unanswered | Anthony Costello", "body": "The public health response to a serious epidemic is laid out simply and clearly by the World Health Organization (WHO). Test intensively, trace contacts, quarantine and maintain social distancing. When Covid-19 got out of control in Wuhan, after three weeks of public health inaction, the Chinese authorities mounted a proper campaign to control the virus. They listened to the WHO. They tested extensively, setting up mobile testing centres, and getting the test result time down from four days to four hours. They cut the time from onset of symptoms to lab result from 12 to three days. They identified family clusters (the virus spreads mainly through extended close contact so family members are most at risk) and arranged isolation centres for contacts.\n\nAbove all, they mobilised communities. They didn't leave it all to messages and nudge behavioural methods. Yes, Wuhan was in lockdown, but across the country local authorities had high autonomy to help people abide by these best public health principles. This was not a terrorised population but one passionate about tackling an existential threat. They also used apps and smartphones to get messages across, to share information about local clusters and for data collection. Everyone in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, ordered their food online, and had it delivered. And the strategy worked. In seven weeks China stopped the epidemic in its tracks. It now reports only 10 to 20 new cases per day in a population of nearly 1.4 billion. Deaths have plummeted. Several other countries, including South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan, have copied this strategy, with local modifications, with similar results.\n\nNow they realise they must face the challenge of how to loosen up, and whether allowing the economy to recover will lead to more outbreaks, but they have a nationwide system to jump on new clusters and outbreaks to keep this under control. The aim is to wait and hope for drugs and vaccines to emerge in the next 12 months to enable them to treat cases and to build proper herd immunity from a vaccine.\n\nI had assumed that the UK would do the same, that the authorities would be building their resources and plans around nationwide testing, contact tracing, quarantine and a progressive policy of social distancing. I assumed they would inform the public they had a two- to three-month \"contain and delay\" strategy to get the epidemic under control, and mobilise communities everywhere to provide local support. But from the press conferences last week, the government is not following the WHO strategy. They appear to have concluded that it is inevitable most people would get the disease, so we should let the epidemic proceed to allow 60% of the population to become infected and build herd immunity through the wild virus. What is the scientific justification for this departure from WHO policy? I have questions:\n\nWhy have they abandoned population testing and contact tracing to identify and seclude clusters of infections? They recommend only testing cases in hospital. Won't this strategy ensure that the spread of the virus is intense and will cause more infections and more deaths in the near term?\n\nWhy do they recommend self-isolation only for people with symptoms when Maria Van Kerkhove of the WHO reports that \"it seems that people shed more virus in the early phases rather than the late phases of disease\"? Asymptomatic contacts may be highly infectious, so they should be tested, isolated and followed up in the community. Will they set up quarantine centres to help those who have no family support or are homeless, or need social care?\n\nWhat are their plans for national, district, municipal, village and community mobilisation? \"Nudge\" is not enough. We need to devolve power and autonomy to allow locally intelligent decisions around a coherent national strategy. What is their detailed strategy for screening of infected people in the home, and provision of CT scans for those with early signs of pneumonia and to identify those at high risk? Without an all-out national mobilisation for social distancing, are the behavioural and nudge strategies really evidence-based to flatten the peak? Or simply based on models?\n\nWhy are we emphasising herd immunity now? Does coronavirus induce strong herd immunity or is it like flu, where immunity remains weak and new strains emerge each year? We have much to learn about Covid-19 immune responses. Doesn't this contradict WHO policy? Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said after declaring a pandemic: \"The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\"\n\nShouldn't we wait to see the China situation? They have contained the epidemic after seven weeks of intensive national effort. Will epidemics break out again in new states? Maybe. Will their strengthened systems not contain them quickly and effectively? What is their herd immunity to date? We don't have the data available but new tests are coming online. It might be substantial, without a massive epidemic.\n\nThe WHO policy - practised by China, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong - is to keep things damped down until drugs and a vaccine are available. Vaccines are a safer way to develop herd immunity, without the risks associated with the disease itself. Is it wise or ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of uncertain future benefit?\n\nWhat is the policy to promote social distancing? How can we promote advice for families, mass gatherings, schools, workplaces, restaurants, theatres? And can we make it locally relevant? School closures might be phased depending on the intensity of transmission based on local data about clusters, as they did in Singapore. But we need testing and sharing of information online for local decisions.\n\nFinally, on the precautionary principle, shouldn't we go all out to damp this epidemic down, with all possible measures, whether evidence is strong, uncertain or weak, and worry about herd immunity when we have more evidence? The stated government policy is to allow 40 million people to become infected. This could mean 6 million hospital admissions, 2 million requiring special or intensive care, and 402,000 deaths if the chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty's 1% estimate of mortality is correct.\n\nWe can suppress this epidemic in the way that China and other countries have done. Then we can worry about how to loosen up, and hope that a vaccine comes onboard. But we need to act now. Every day of delay will mean more people become infected or die.\n\n* Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London and a former director of
