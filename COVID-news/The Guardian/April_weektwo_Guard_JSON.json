They said it was almost always human behaviour that caused diseases to spill over into humans.\n\nTo prevent further outbreaks, the experts said, both global heating and the destruction of the natural world for farming, mining and housing have to end, as both drive wildlife into contact with people.\n\nThey also urged authorities to put an end to live animal markets - which they called an \"ideal mixing bowl\" for disease - and the illegal global animal trade.\n\nAndersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said the immediate priority was to protect people from the coronavirus and prevent its spread. \"But our long-term response must tackle habitat and biodiversity loss,\" she added.\n\n\"Never before have so many opportunities existed for pathogens to pass from wild and domestic animals to people,\" she told the Guardian, explaining that 75% of all emerging infectious diseases come from wildlife.\n\n\"Our continued erosion of wild spaces has brought us uncomfortably close to animals and plants that harbour diseases that can jump to humans.\"\n\nShe also noted other environmental impacts, such as the Australian bushfires, broken heat records and the worst locust invasion in Kenya for 70 years. \"At the end of the day, [with] all of these events, nature is sending us a message,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"There are too many pressures at the same time on our natural systems and something has to give,\" she added. \"We are intimately interconnected with nature, whether we like it or not. If we don't take care of nature, we can't take care of ourselves. And as we hurtle towards a population of 10 billion people on this planet, we need to go into this future armed with nature as our strongest ally.\"\n\nHuman infectious disease outbreaks are rising and in recent years there have been Ebola, bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), Rift Valley fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), West Nile virus and Zika virus all cross from animals to humans.\n\n\"The emergence and spread of Covid-19 was not only predictable, it was predicted [in the sense that] there would be another viral emergence from wildlife that would be a public health threat,\" said Prof Andrew Cunningham, of the Zoological Society of London. A 2007 study of the 2002-03 Sars outbreak concluded: \"The presence of a large reservoir of Sars-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a timebomb.\"\n\nCunningham said other diseases from wildlife had much higher fatality rates in people, such as 50% for Ebola and 60%-75% for Nipah virus, transmitted from bats in south Asia. \"Although, you might not think it at the moment, we've probably got a bit lucky with [Covid-19],\" he said. \"So I think we should be taking this as a clear warning shot. It's a throw of the dice.\"\n\n\"It's almost always a human behaviour that causes it and there will be more in the future unless we change,\" said Cunningham. Markets butchering live wild animals from far and wide are the most obvious example, he said. A market in China is believed to have been the source of Covid-19.\n\n\"The animals have been transported over large distances and are crammed together into cages. They are stressed and immunosuppressed and excreting whatever pathogens they have in them,\" he said. \"With people in large numbers in the market and in intimate contact with the body fluids of these animals, you have an ideal mixing bowl for [disease] emergence. If you wanted a scenario to maximise the chances of [transmission], I couldn't think of a much better way of doing it.\"\n\nChina has banned such markets, and Cunningham said this must be permanent. \"However, this needs to be done globally. There are wet markets throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and a lot of other Asian countries too.\" The ease of travel in the modern world exacerbates the dangers, he said, adding: \"These days, you can be in a central African rainforest one day and in central London the next.\"\n\nAaron Bernstein, at the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, said the destruction of natural places drives wildlife to live close to people and that climate change was also forcing animals to move: \"That creates an opportunity for pathogens to get into new hosts.\"\n\n\"We've had Sars, Mers, Covid-19, HIV. We need to see what nature is trying to tell us here. We need to recognise that we're playing with fire,\" he said.\n\n\"The separation of health and environmental policy is a dangerous delusion. Our health entirely depends on the climate and the other organisms we share the planet with.\"\n\nThe billion-dollar illegal wildlife trade is another part of the problem, said John Scanlon, the former secretary general of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.\n\n\"Importing countries should create a new legal obligation, supported by criminal sanctions, for an importer of wildlife to prove that it was legally obtained under the source country's national laws,\" he said. \"If we can blend taking a hard line against transnational organised wildlife criminals, while also opening up new opportunities for local communities, then we will see biodiversity, ecosystems and communities thrive.\"\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis may provide an opportunity for change, but Cunningham is not convinced it will be taken: \"I thought things would have changed after Sars, which was a massive wake up call - the biggest economic impact of any emerging disease to that date,\" he said.Advertisement\n\n\"Everybody was up in arms about it. But it went away, because of our control measures. Then there was a huge sigh of relief and it was back to business as usual. We cannot go back to business as usual.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

but sustained by them | Nesrine Malik", "body": "Amged el-Hawrani thought he just had the flu. He thought maybe he was just a bit run down or hadn't been sleeping enough. By the time he was admitted to hospital with breathing difficulties and put on a ventilator, it was already too late. Three weeks later, he died of Covid-19. He was 55 years old.\n\nThe NHS ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant never knew he had the virus. He was sedated long before the test came back positive, after twice coming back negative. The diagnosis until the final test result was a stubborn bilateral pneumonia. A physician to the end, his last words before being sedated were \"why are they taking so long, they need to intubate me\".\n\nAs an ENT surgery consultant he was especially vulnerable to catching Covid-19, and was likely exposed to patients whose complaints were coronavirus-related: loss of taste and smell, breathing issues and persistent coughs. \"He wasn't even aware he needed protective gear,\" his brother Amal told me, \"he was just doing his job.\"\n\nEl-Hawrani was one of six boys whose Sudanese parents settled in the UK in 1975. Their late father, a consultant radiologist, moved to the UK to gain access to the latest equipment and research in his speciality, and passed on his passion for medicine to his eldest sons. \"He had no hobbies, he was always studying, always reading, he loved it,\" Amal recalls.\n\nThe love for the vocation extended outside of the family, as the El-Hawrani home became a hub for other Sudanese doctors in training. Those who needed advice and guidance on their professional journey, or just needed a place to stay as they did so, found refuge in the El-Hawrani home, rent free. The commitment to family and medicine was passed down. \"Most of my dad's time was dedicated towards his family,\" said El-Hawrani's son, Ashraf, \"the rest was dedicated towards his profession.\"\n\nToday, the close-knit family, and the wider medical community of friends around it, cannot even seek some small comfort in mourning together. Alongside the shock of El-Hawrani's death now lies the dread of the disease infecting his mother, who is in her late 70s. Her sons have isolated themselves from her and each other, and turned away mourners.\n\nEl-Hawrani was the second frontline doctor to die of the virus. The first was also of Sudanese origin; Dr Adil El Tayar, an organ transplant specialist who volunteered in an A&E department in the Midlands to help fight the virus. Two of the four children he left behind are also NHS doctors.\n\nFollowing their deaths, the contributions of El-Hawrani and El Tayar and their families to our healthcare system have been held up as exemplars. Yes, they were gifted and selfless, but they were not exceptions. They were part of a community of NHS doctors all over the UK, who are foreign born, or born to immigrants.\n\nIn the 1970s and 80s, El-Hawrani and his siblings grew up in a country matter-of-factly hostile to people of colour. His younger brother Amal recalls being told by other children that he couldn't play with them because he was brown. Thirty years later, the UK is more diverse, but the antipathy towards immigrants has crept upwards, voiced by politicians instead of schoolchildren. The narrative they set for the country in general, and the NHS in particular, is that they are being drained by immigrants who put nothing in and take everything out. This was always a lie, but it has never been a more discreditable one than now.\n\nAlongside El-Hawrani and El Tayar in the honour roll now sit Dr Alfa Saadu, who was also volunteering, this time in Hertfordshire, one of the counties worst hit by the virus; general practitioner Dr Habib Zaidi; and Areema Nasreen, an acute medical unit nurse. The numbers do, and have always told the truth: 44% of medical staff are BAME. For nurses and midwives, it is one in every five, and in some areas such as London, it is four in 10.\n\nNot that the government has made it easy for non-EU migrant doctors to work in the UK. They have to navigate a complex maze of Home Office requirements to renew expensive work visas which are often tied to jobs which are themselves dependent on budgetary constraints. A single fallen domino in this chain ejects a sorely needed doctor from the country.\n\nIn its newfound affection for the NHS and such doctors, the government has now shown hitherto unattainable bureaucratic agility, and decided that all nurses, doctors, paramedics and healthcare professionals will have their visas automatically renewed for a year free of charge.\n\nMany of these migrant doctors will be paying a hefty annual NHS surcharge for the privilege of using an NHS they staff, in addition to paying tax and national insurance contributions. This surcharge is set to rise from \u00a3400 to \u00a3624 a year this October. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who in November declared that the NHS surcharge was going to be extended because \"it's the National Health Service not the International Health Service\", on Thursday saluted those NHS staffers who perished as \"people who came to this country to make a difference\".\n\nThese are likely to be temporary face- and life-saving platitudes and measures. When it's back to business as usual, when the NHS is used as a political pawn, and blame for its underfunding is placed at the feet of migrants, remember Amged El-Hawrani and all the others who fell on its frontline to save lives. Remember their names, their faces, their stories and the families they left behind. And remember that the NHS is not drained by migrants, but sustained by them.\n\nNesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

the actor best-known for playing Bond girl Pussy Galore, has died aged 94.\n\nThe actor, who became a household name in the 1960s as Cathy Gale in The Avengers and enjoyed a career spanning eight decades, died of natural causes unrelated to coronavirus.\n\nBlackman's family called her an \"adored mother and grandmother\" who possessed \"an extraordinary combination of beauty, brains and physical prowess\".\n\nIn a statement to the Guardian, her family said: \"It's with great sadness that we have to announce the death of Honor Blackman aged 94. She died peacefully of natural causes at her home in Lewes, Sussex, surrounded by her family. She was much loved and will be greatly missed by her two children Barnaby and Lottie, and grandchildren Daisy, Oscar, Olive and Toby.\n\n\"As well as being a much-adored mother and grandmother, Honor was an actor of hugely prolific creative talent; with an extraordinary combination of beauty, brains and physical prowess, along with her unique voice and a dedicated work ethic, she achieved an unparalleled iconic status in the world of film and entertainment and with absolute commitment to her craft and total professionalism in all her endeavours she contributed to some of the great films and theatre productions of our times.\"\n\nAs well as her parts as Cathy Gale in The Avengers and Bond girl Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, her family highlighted Blackman's roles as the vengeful goddess Hera in Jason and the Argonauts and as Laura West in the 1990s sitcom The Upper Hand. She appeared in theatrical productions including The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady and Cabaret.\n\nIn recent years, she had toured and performed in her show Honor Blackman as herself, in which her family said she looked back over \"her astonishing life, her beginnings, her family, and her rise to stardom with her usual sense of humour and perspective\".\n\nBlackman was a voracious consumer of current affairs, they added, saying: \"Honor was an avid reader of news and politics and she particularly loved the Guardian newspaper, along with all forms of insightful unbiased reporting and intellectually enlightened broadcasting.\"\n\nBorn in east London to a middle-class family - her father was a civil servant - Blackman credited the elocution lessons she received as a birthday gift as allowing her to progress in her acting career. After studying at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, she secured small roles in films and TV shows such as Titanic drama A Night to Remember (1958) and the Edgar Wallace vigilante series The Four Just Men (1959-60).\n\nShe secured her breakthrough when she was cast in 1962 as leather-clad crimefighter Cathy Gale in the hit British show The Avengers, alongside Patrick Macnee as the bowler-hatted John Steed. Blackman had to learn judo for the role, and her tough persona allied to then daring costume choices - boots and figure-hugging catsuits - ensured she quickly assumed star status. One of its unlikely results was a hit single, Kinky Boots, recorded in 1964 with Macnee, which became a top 10 hit in 1990.\n\nBlackman's profinciency in martial arts helped her land what became her signature role, that of Pussy Galore, the glamorous villain assisting in Goldfinger's plot to rob Fort Knox. Released in 1964, Goldfinger was the third Bond film and was a major global hit. However, Blackman later told the Guardian she regretted leaving The Avengers to play the part. \"I walked away at the wrong moment. They were just going from black and white to colour, they were starting to get real film money.\"\n\nIn the wake of her rise to mainstream fame, Blackman made noticeable appearances in such films as Jason and the Argonauts (1963), Shalako (1968) and The Virgin and the Gypsy (1970), but while she worked steadily in film, her TV work was higher profile, and included guest appearances in Columbo, Minder and Doctor Who. In 1990, she was cast in a regular role in the ITV sitcom The Upper Hand, playing the glamorous mother of the lead female character. Blackman expressed her fondness for the role, saying it \"made women who'd just retired and felt they'd been put on the backburner realise they had a lot of life left to live\".\n\nBlackman was also a committed activist, campaigning for the Liberal party and later becoming a member of the Liberal Democrats. She was also a staunch republican, and turned down a CBE in 2002 to avoid being a \"hypocrite\". More recently, she joined a campaign to demand compensation payments for pensioners who lost savings in the Equitable Life scandal.\n\nBlackman was married and divorced twice, to Bill Sankey and Maurice Kaufmann.

return to normal", "body": "From goodness knows where, in the last few weeks school and college leaders have pulled out all the stops. Despite 10 years of real-term funding cuts and ongoing fears of redundancies, the education profession has risen to the Covid-19 challenge.\n\nFrom nursery schools to further education colleges, colleagues have entrenched themselves in their communities, caring for the children of key workers and those at risk of harm while becoming distributors of food and providers of essential social care services.\n\nHundreds of thousands of teachers and support staff are busy at home trying to provide a support system for parents and a semblance of routine for children and young people. Many are reassuring those who would have been taking GCSEs and A-levels, or providing online learning resources and marking coursework for students of applied qualifications.\n\nHowever, decisions and support from the Department for Education have been slow, reactionary, and leaked to the press rather than first shared with the profession. They have not been collaborative. School and college leaders, local authorities and trade unions have filled the gaping hole vacated by central government.\n\nOne thing is clear, when this is over, society will be fundamentally changed. Children and their families, our school and college communities, will need considerable support to deal with illness and bereavement, changes in employment and housing situations.\n\nNo adult or child will be untouched. When we come out of social distancing and isolation, children and young people and their families will need help to manage mental health, self-esteem, friendships and relationships.\n\nEducation will need to change, too. We cannot simply return to the status quo. A third of teachers are actively thinking of leaving the profession within the next five years; there is a teacher and school leader recruitment crisis. Education support staff roles have been cut to the bone and teaching assistants, supporting the children with the most complex special needs, are being paid insultingly low wages that do not reflect their importance.\n\nCancelling Sats tests and public exams was the right decision. However, it is not only the 2019-20 cohort who will be affected by this crisis. The education, physical and mental health of a generation is at stake. Children of NHS and other key and essential workers will see their parents exhausted and exposed to the biggest health risk in a hundred years.\n\nWhen we go back to school everything will be different - and it must be different. We need to ask ourselves the fundamental question: what is the purpose of education?\n\nWhen the time is right we, the profession, the experts, must start formulating the answer. We must be ready to enter a new reality of an education system that values the professional judgment of teachers and leaders.\n\nWe cannot continue to have a system that has nearly 3,000 children with special educational needs and disabilities lacking a permanent school place. We cannot continue to have an exam system that leaves a third of pupils labelled as failures.\n\nThe use of education as an ideological and political football that fails the most vulnerable must end. We cannot continue with a toxic exam system that is based on rote learning and an out-of-date curriculum chosen by whoever happens to be the education secretary, and an exam system that has been responsible for a dramatic rise in child and adolescent mental health illness.\n\nWe have got to stop the testing hamster wheel that burns out children. We cannot continue to allow 16-year-olds to sit 33 hours of GCSE exams, when education and training continues to age 18 and beyond.\n\nWe must end the fixation with A-levels as the \"gold standard\", just because they've been around a long time. Our education system must recognise the achievements of all and must not continue to label those who take a vocational education route as less worthy or less valuable, or their qualifications less rigorous.\n\nWe must end the education \"market\" and the game playing, end the practice of schools competing against each other for pupils, results and league table places.\n\nWe cannot and will not continue to be terrorised by Ofsted, an overbearing accountability system that ends the careers of school leaders and teachers, discourages professional collaboration, drives up stress levels and disadvantages those working in the most deprived areas.\n\nThis pandemic is going to hurt those most at risk: those in precarious employment, those in rented accommodation and all those who, just weeks ago, the government labelled as unskilled - the essential workers in schools, shops, hospitality, social care, delivery and communications, cleaners, caretakers, the armed forces, police, fire, ambulance and the NHS.\n\nIf we don't recognise now the vital importance of an inclusive education system and the positive impact it can have on developing a fairer society, then, I fear, we never will. We must use the situation we are faced with now to end child poverty and inequalities in education and the wider society.\n\nNiamh Sweeney is a teacher of health and social care and criminology at

pull its economy through the coronavirus crisis, the Mafia is gaining local support by distributing free food to poor families in quarantine who have run out of cash, authorities have warned.\n\nIn recent weeks, videos have surfaced of known Mafia gangs delivering essential goods to Italians hit hard by the coronavirus emergency across the poorest southern regions of Campania, Calabria, Sicily and Puglia, as tensions are rising across the country.\n\n\"For over a month, shops, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and pubs have been closed\", Nicola Gratteri, antimafia investigator and head of the prosecutor's office in Catanzaro, told the Guardian. \"Millions of people work in the grey economy, which means that they haven't received any income in more than a month and have no idea when they might return to work. The government is issuing so-called shopping vouchers to support people. If the state doesn't step in soon to help these families, the mafia will provide its services, imposing their control over people's lives.\"\n\nThe ramifications of the lockdown in Italy are affecting the estimated 3.3 million people in Italy who work off the books. Of those, more than 1 million live in the south, according to the most recent figures from CGIA Mestre, a Venice-based small business association. There have been reports of small shop owners being pressured to give food for free, while police are patrolling supermarkets in some areas to stop thefts. Videos of people in Sicily protesting against the government's stalled response, or people beating their fists outside banks in Bari for a \u20ac50 (\u00a344) loan are going viral and throwing fuel on the crisis; a fire the mafia is more than willing to stoke.\n\nFrom the first signals of mounting social unrest, the Italian minister of the interior, , said ''the mafia could take advantage of the rising poverty, swooping in to recruit people to its organisation''. Or simply stepping in to distribute free food parcels of pasta, water, flour and milk.\n\nIn recent days, the police in Naples have intensified their presence in the poorest quarters of the city, where men tied to the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia, have organised home delivery of food parcels. Magistrates have already begun an investigation against a group of people who were questioned while distributing food to local residents.\n\nIn Palermo, according to La Repubblica, the brother of a Cosa Nostra boss allegedly distributed food to the poor in the Zen neighbourhood, an area with an established mafia presence. When the news broke, the man defended himself on Facebook, claiming that he was only doing charitable work and attacking the journalist who first reported the news.\n\n\"Mafias are not just criminal organisations,'' Federico Varese, professor of criminology at the University of Oxfordsaid. \"They are organisations that aspire to govern territories and markets. Commentators often focus on the financial aspect of mafias but they tend to forget that their strength comes from having a local base from which to operate.\"\n\nThe question of distributing food parcels is a tactic as old as the mafia itself, where in the south of Italy bosses have customarily presented themselves to the people as benefactors and local power brokers, initially without asking for anything in return.\n\n\"Mafia bosses consider their cities as their own fiefdom,\" Gratteri said. \"The bosses know very well that in order to govern, they need to take care of the people in their territory. And they do it by exploiting the situation to their advantage. In the people's eyes, a boss who knocks on the door offering free food is a hero. And the boss knows that he can then count on the support of these families when necessary, when, for example, the mafia sponsors a politician for election who will further their criminal interests.\"\n\nDozens of investigations in the south have led to the arrest of politicians who have aided and abetted the mafia, and who were elected with the support of local Mafiosi who forced citizens to vote for them in exchange for services, such as a simple food parcel.\n\nVarese said: \"These handouts by the mafias are not gifts. The mafia does not do anything out of its kind heart. They are favours that everyone will have to pay back in some form or another, by aiding and abetting a fugitive, holding a gun, dealing drugs and the like.\"\n\n\"Consider what happened to El Chapo, the Mexican narco,\" said Gratteri. \"He trafficked tons of cocaine and commissioned the murder of hundreds of people but in his hometown he was known for his benevolence, because people said that he provided medicines to families or built roads. The same thing happens here.\"\n\nThis week, Itay's antimafia prosecutor's office said bosses will offer their virtually endless criminal capital to businesses in need, and swallow them up. Then, they will use those businesses for money laundering profits from the criminal activities.\n\nVarese said: 'The mafias might be able to benefit in other ways from the current lockdown and especially from the future, when Italians will all be able to return to work, spend more money, and get the economy on its feet again. But surely the story exemplified by the handouts of food parcels in Palermo and Naples shows their true nature, and it tells why they are so dangerous.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

urged the public not to overuse personal protective equipment to ensure it can be channelled to frontline health staff, saying, \"a front door is better than any face mask\".\n\nAfter weeks of criticism over the lack of vital equipment, the health secretary said a \"Herculean effort\" was under way to ensure every health and social care worker dealing with coronavirus has the equipment they need.\n\nBut in remarks criticised by doctors' and nurses' representatives he asked people to ensure it is used sparingly. \"We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource it is,\" he said. \"Everyone should use the equipment they clinically need, in line with the guidelines: no more and no less.\"\n\nWith the government not recommending the general use of protective face masks to slow the spread of disease, the health secretary underlined staying at home as the most important measure the public can take.\n\nHe and the chief nursing officer, Ruth May, declined to give a figure for how many healthcare staff have died after contracting the virus.\n\nHancock said a nationwide delivery system had been set up, with the help of the armed forces, to distribute masks, aprons and other equipment to 58,000 healthcare providers.\n\nHancock said: \"We've had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch.\" Within a week, every NHS hospital would be receiving daily deliveries, he added.\n\nThe shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, welcomed the promise that more PPE would reach the frontline but pressed Hancock to ensure it was met.\n\nAshworth said: \"This isn't the first time ministers have given NHS and social care staff big promises on PPE. But there has been a mismatch between statements at Downing Street press conferences and the realities facing health and care staff on the ground. Staff have been raising the lack of PPE for weeks. We hope the government's plans today deliver the adequate supplies of PPE our brave healthcare staff deserve.\"\n\nDoctors' and nurses' leaders criticised Hancock's plan as inadequate, given the growing death toll of NHS staff from Coronavirus.\n\nThe British Medical Association said PPE shortages could spell \"real disaster\" for doctors. It also took issue with Hancock's insistence that the NHS has enough PPE to go round but needs frontline staff to use \"no more and no less\" than they clinically need.\n\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA's chair, said: \"We are dealing with an unknown, highly infectious, and potentially deadly virus that has already claimed the lives of several healthcare workers, including 11 doctors in the UK. It is absurd that the people trained to treat this disease are the ones who are not being appropriately protected - and without them, we face real disaster.\n\n\"We note the government's announcement this afternoon and its three-strand PPE Plan. However, PPE should not be a 'precious resource' and for NHS staff facing shortages of protection they need today, they don't want to hear of a plan, but that this vital equipment is made available to the frontline now.\"\n\nSusan Masters, director of nursing at the Royal College of Nursing, also voiced scepticism that Hancock's pledges would end the supply problems that are causing alarm and fear among staff, and denied nurses were misusing PPE.\n\nMasters said: \"These figures on deliveries are only impressive when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn't available. The calls are still coming through - people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already.\n\n\"Things have improved in recent days and I credit the government with that. But the safety of nurses and care staff must not be compromised. They are pretty clear about what they need to do to stay safe and they will be angered by any suggestion they cause shortages by misusing kit.\"\n\nAs well as promising to tackle what he acknowledged was the \"enormous challenge\" of ensuring PPE reaches those who need it, Hancock said lab capacity had been increased sufficiently to allow any health or social care worker who needs it, to be tested.\n\nHe visited a newly opened \"mega-lab\" in Milton Keynes on Thursday and said 15 drive-through testing centres were available.\n\nHe stressed the complexities of meeting demand for PPE against the background of rocketing global demand, and without a significant domestic supply sector.\n\nDiplomatic staff around the world have been pressed into service trying to source equipment, Hancock said, with Whitehall officials in London trying to organise transporting it to the UK.\n\nHe praised firms, including Burberry and Rolls Royce, which have turned their facilities to manufacturing PPE - and urged others to do so, based on requirements published by the government. \"If you've got production facilities, and you can meet our published specifications, we want to hear from you,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Hancock also announced the government has the capacity to test all health and social care staff.\n\nAppearing alongside Hancock, May underlined the toll, both physical and mental, that treating the virus is having on her frontline colleagues. But she said they were heartened by the public's support. \"The rainbows and NHS signs in the windows lift me, and they lift my colleagues,\" she said.\n\nShe and Hancock emphasised the importance of the public continuing to use the NHS for conditions unrelated to the coronavirus.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

have been accused of raking in billions from market bets during the coronavirus crisis while care workers in high-risk environments can barely scrape by.\n\nFrances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC trade union body, launched a stinging attack on hedge fund managers on Thursday after it was revealed one London hedge fund had made \u00a32.4bn betting on market moves as investors panicked over a global economic shutdown.\n\nNews of the multibillion-pound windfall came as Crispin Odey, the Brexit supporter who made millions betting against the pound in the runup to the EU referendum, said his fund had made its biggest monthly gain since the financial crisis.\n\nO'Grady said: \"It's a sign of our broken economy that hedge fund managers are raking in billions, while care workers who are putting their lives on the line can barely scrape by. When the immediate crisis has passed, we need to rebuild a more equal economy. The super-rich must be made to pay their fair share and ordinary workers should get the respect and pay they deserve.\"\n\nRuffer Investment, which was founded by multimillionaire financier Jonathan Ruffer, told clients it had made $2.6bn (\u00a32.4bn) during the coronavirus pandemic-induced global stock market collapse after a series of cheap \"protective investment\" bets on market volatility delivered huge returns. The story was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nIt also came to light that a US hedge fund made a 4,144% return betting on a stock market collapse in the year to the end of March. The Miami-based Universa Investments fund, which is advised by The Black Swan author Nassim Taleb, made a return of 3,612% in March alone. \"I think we've shown Universa's method of risk mitigation to be the most effective,\" Mark Spitznagel, the fund's president and chief investment officer, said in an investor letter seen by Bloomberg.\n\nOdey Asset Management declined to comment on the TUC's call for hedge fund owners to pay a \"fair share\" towards the fight against coronavirus. The fund made a return of 21% in March.\n\nOdey, who has an estimated \u00a3800m fortune, privately told clients that the world was facing a crisis as bad as the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n\nIn a letter to investors on Thursday and reported by Bloomberg, Odey said: \"This is not like 2008-9, nor 2001-2, nor even 1989-92. The fall in global gross national product for this year will echo 1931-2.

"body": "Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic, which he once dismissed as a hoax, has been fiercely criticised at home as woefully inadequate to the point of irresponsibility.\n\nYet also thanks largely to Trump, a parallel disaster is unfolding across the world: the ruination of America's reputation as a safe, trustworthy, competent international leader and partner.\n\nCall it the Trump double-whammy. Diplomatically speaking, the US is on life support.\n\n\"The Trump administration's self-centred, haphazard, and tone-deaf response [to Covid-19] will end up costing Americans trillions of dollars and thousands of otherwise preventable deaths,\" wrote Stephen Walt, professor of international relations at Harvard.\n\n\"But that's not the only damage the United States will suffer. Far from 'making America great again', this epic policy failure will further tarnish [its] reputation as a country that knows how to do things effectively.\"\n\nThis adverse shift could be permanent, Walt warned. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has insulted America's friends, undermined multilateral alliances and chosen confrontation over cooperation. Sanctions, embargoes and boycotts aimed at China, Iran and Europe have been globally divisive.\n\nFor the most part, oft-maligned foreign leaders such as Germany's Angela Merkel have listened politely, turning the other cheek in the interests of preserving the broader relationship.\n\nBut Trump's ineptitude and dishonesty in handling the pandemic, which has left foreign observers as well as Americans gasping in disbelief, is proving a bridge too far.\n\nErratic behaviour, tolerated in the past, is now seen as downright dangerous. It's long been plain, at least to many in Europe, that Trump could not be trusted. Now he is seen as a threat. It is not just about failed leadership. It's about openly hostile, reckless actions.\n\nThe furious reaction in Germany after 200,000 protective masks destined for Berlin mysteriously went missing in Thailand and were allegedly redirected to the US is a case in point. There is no solid proof Trump approved the heist. But it's the sort of thing he would do - or so people believe.\n\n\"We consider this to be an act of modern piracy. This is no way to treat transatlantic partners. Even in times of global crisis, we shouldn't resort to the tactics of the wild west,\" said Andreas Geisel, a leading Berlin politician. Significantly, Merkel has refused to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.\n\nEuropeans were already outraged by Trump's reported efforts to acquire monopoly rights to a coronavirus vaccine under development in Germany. This latest example of nationalistic self-interest compounded anger across the EU over Trump's travel ban, imposed last month without consultation or scientific justification.\n\nUS reputational damage is not confined to Europe. There was dismay among the G7 countries that a joint statement on tackling the pandemic could not be agreed because Trump insisted on calling it the \"Wuhan virus\" - his crude way of pinning sole blame on China.\n\nInternational action has also been hampered at the UN security council by US objections over terminology.\n\nTrump has ignored impassioned calls to create a Covid-19 global taskforce or coalition. He appears oblivious to the catastrophe bearing down on millions of people in the developing world.\n\n\"Trump's battle against multilateralism has made it so that even formats like the G7 are no longer working,\" commented Christoph Schult in Der Spiegel. \"It appears the coronavirus is destroying the last vestiges of a world order.\"\n\nTrump's surreal televised Covid-19 briefings are further undermining respect for US leadership. Trump regularly propagates false or misleading information, bets on hunches, argues with reporters and contradicts scientific and medical experts.\n\nWhile publicly rejecting foreign help, Trump has privately asked European and Asian allies for aid - even those, such as South Korea, that he previously berated. And he continues to smear the World Health Organization in a transparent quest for scapegoats.\n\nTo a watching world, the absence of a fair, affordable US healthcare system, the cut-throat contest between American states for scarce medical supplies, the disproportionate death toll among ethnic minorities, chaotic social distancing rules, and a lack of centralised coordination are reminiscent of a poor, developing country, not the most powerful, influential nation on earth.\n\nThat's a title the US appears on course to lose - a fall from grace that may prove irreversible. The domestic debacle unleashed by the pandemic, and global perceptions of American selfishness and incompetence, could change everything. According to Walt, Trump has presided over \"a failure of character unparalleled in US history\".\n\nDo Americans realise how far their country's moral as well as financial stock has fallen? Perhaps at this time of extreme stress, it seems not to matter. But it will matter later on - for them and for the future international balance of power.\n\nHeiko Maas, Germany's foreign minister, said he hoped the crisis would force a fundamental US rethink about \"whether the 'America first' model really works\". The Trump administration's response had been too slow, he said. \"Hollowing out international connections comes at a high price,\" Maas warned.\n\nLasting resentment over how the US went missing in action in the coronavirus wars of 2020 may change the way the world works.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"Germany's army is donating 60 mobile ventilators to the UK following a call for help as the NHS races to get hold of enough life-saving equipment in the runup to the expected peak of the UK's Covid-19 pandemic in mid-April.\n\nOfficials have been racing to obtain ventilators internationally because UK manufacturers have not been able to produce enough in time.\n\nA spokesperson for the German defence ministry confirmed to the Guardian a report in Der Spiegel, according to which the Bundeswehr would send 60 pieces of the life-saving equipment as soon as possible.\n\nHighlighting the urgency of the British situation, the German ministry said it would not invoice the UK for the ventilators, which are made by two specialist German manufacturers, Dr\u00e4ger and Weinmann.\n\nAt present the NHS has about 10,000 ventilators available, but Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said that 18,000 are needed to ensure there will be ample capacity in seven to 10 days, when it is believed case numbers will peak.\n\nMore than 480 ventilators are understood to have arrived in the UK from overseas since March. They have been bought or donated from China, which has supplied 300, the US, Germany, Sweden and Taiwan.\n\nDonald Trump said this week that the UK had been in touch to chase up the delivery of 200 ventilators already ordered from US companies, saying, \"They need them desperately.\"\n\nNHS officials say another 1,500 ventilators are on order and due to arrive in the next fortnight, and several thousand more are due to come from British manufacturers in the weeks after that.\n\nThat would still leave the NHS below Hancock's 18,000 target, but the Department of Health insists that enough ventilators will be available to deal with the peak of coronavirus cases, because the strategy had been to remain ahead of patient demand.\n\nVentilators are critical in keeping the most severely ill coronavirus patients alive. The UK had only 5,000 of the medical devices available in the middle of March, when the severity of the disease became clear.\n\nMinisters called on the private sector to make ventilators as part of the Ventilator Challenge UK initiative, but despite a positive response from a string of British companies, it has taken time to make devices, which also need regulatory approval before they can be used.\n\nStefan Dr\u00e4ger recently said his company had doubled its production volume in February this year and was under pressure to quadruple it as requests from countries around the world came pouring in. Dr\u00e4ger, 57, told Der Spiegel that he expected that \"the challenge [of the Covid-19 pandemic] in England will be greater than in Spain\", because of an unequal distribution of intensive care beds.\n\nBritish firms such as Dyson, Babcock, a defence contractor, and Cambridge-based Sagentia have each been asked to provide 10,000 newly designed models. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus has been working with an existing supplier, Penlon, to help increase its production.\n\nPrior to these efforts by established British manufacturers, Penlon and Smiths Group were making around 50 to 60 ventilators a week.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_sabbagh@theguardian.com", "name":

wanting to end the lockdown and allow people to move about and work again will have to monitor closely for new infections and adjust the controls they have in place until there is a vaccine against Covid-19, according to a new study based on the Chinese experience.\n\nChina's aggressive controls over daily life have brought the first wave of Covid-19 to an end, say researchers based in Hong Kong. But the danger of a second wave is very real.\n\n\"While these control measures appear to have reduced the number of infections to very low levels, without herd immunity against Covid-19, cases could easily resurge as businesses, factory operations, and schools gradually resume and increase social mixing, particularly given the increasing risk of imported cases from overseas as Covid-19 continues to spread globally,\" says Prof Joseph T Wu from the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the research.\n\nChina has pushed the reproductive number - the number of people on average that one person with Covid-19 will infect - from two or three to below one, where the epidemic is effectively shrinking.\n\nBut, the researchers warn, if normal life is allowed to resume too quickly and the lifting of controls is too extensive, the reproductive number will rise again. Governments will need to keep a close watch on what is happening, they say.\n\n\"Although control policies such as physical distancing and behavioural change are likely to be maintained for some time, proactively striking a balance between resuming economic activities and keeping the reproductive number below one is likely to be the best strategy until effective vaccines become widely available,\" said Wu.\n\nThe paper published in the Lancet medical journal is based on modeling of the epidemic in China. It shows that the death rate in mainland China was far lower, at less than 1%, than in Hubei province where the epidemic began, which had a death rate of nearly 6%. It also varied according to the economic prosperity of each province, which was related to the healthcare available.\n\n\"Even in the most prosperous and well-resourced megacities like Beijing and Shanghai, healthcare resources are finite, and services will struggle with a sudden increase in demand\", says senior author Prof Gabriel M Leung from the University of Hong Kong. \"Our findings highlight the importance of ensuring that local healthcare systems have adequate staffing and resources to minimise Covid-related deaths.\"\n\nTheir analysis uses local Health Commission data of confirmed Covid-19 cases between mid-January and 29 February in four cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou and the ten provinces outside Hubei with the highest numbers of cases. It leads them to urge that controls should be relaxed only gradually.\n\nAllowing the rate of infections to rise again \"would probably incur both marginally higher health and economic loss\", even if tough measures are put back in place to bring the numbers of cases back down.\n\nStriking a balance between allowing economic activities and keeping controls tight enough to prevent a rise in infections \"is likely to be the optimal strategy until effective vaccines become widely available, despite the fact that control policies, including social distancing, behavioural change and public awareness will probably be maintained for some time\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_boseley@theguardian.com", "name":

"World-leading disease data analysts have projected that the UK will become the country worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic in Europe, accounting for more than 40% of total deaths across the continent.\n\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle predicts 66,000 UK deaths from Covid-19 by August, with a peak of nearly 3,000 a day, based on a steep climb in daily deaths early in the outbreak.\n\nThe analysts also claim discussions over \"herd immunity\" led to a delay in the UK introducing physical distancing measures, which were brought in from 23 March in England when the coronavirus death toll stood at 54. Portugal, by comparison, had just one confirmed death when distancing measures were imposed.\n\nThe newly released data is disputed by scientists whose modelling of the likely shape of the UK epidemic is relied on by the government. Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, said the IHME figures on \"healthcare demand\" - including hospital bed use and deaths - were twice as high as they should be.\n\nThe IHME, which is responsible for the ongoing Global Burden of Disease study, calculated the likely need for hospital admissions and intensive care beds and projected deaths in European countries hit by Covid-19.\n\nLooking at the measures taken by the UK to curb the spread of the disease, the institute says the peak is expected in 10 days' time, on 17 April. At that point the country will need more than 102,000 hospital beds, the IHME says. There are nearly 18,000 available, meaning a shortfall of 85,000.\n\nThe same grim picture applies to intensive care beds. At the peak, 24,500 intensive care beds will be needed and 799 are available, the analysts predict. There will be a need for nearly 21,000 ventilators, they say.\n\nAt the peak the UK will see 2,932 deaths a day, the IHME forecasts. By 4 August that would mean a total of 66,314 deaths - with a large estimate range of between 55,022 and 79,995 deaths, indicating the uncertainties around it.\n\nThe death toll in other European countries that are now struggling with Covid-19 will be lower, they say. Spain is projected to have 19,209 deaths by the same date, Italy 20,300 and France 15,058. All three countries have imposed tougher lockdown measures than the UK.\n\nThe IHME bases its forecasts in large part on the trajectory of deaths rather than case numbers and the speed with which distancing measures were put in place.\n\nThe UK will be severely short of beds, it finds. Germany, by contrast, is predicted to have enough hospital beds, including ICU beds, needed for its peak. The IHME predicts Germany will have 8,802 deaths by 4 August.\n\nFrance will have enough general beds but will be around 4,000 short of ICU beds at the peak, says the forecast. There are projected to be just over 15,000 deaths there. Both Italy and Spain are past their peaks, says the IHME.\n\nThe IHME, based at the University of Washington, published its forecast for the US on Sunday, revising down the projected number of Covid-19 deaths there from 93,500 to 81,800. These figures were relied on in part for the US government's own, higher predictions of the coronavirus death toll.\n\nIn March, modellers relied on by the UK government, led by the team at Imperial College in London, said deaths could reach 260,000 in the UK with no restrictions on movement, but they hoped to get deaths down to 20,000 through the lockdown strategy.\n\nFerguson said he did not think the predictions could be relied on. \"This model does not match the current UK situation,\" he said, adding that the numbers used by the IHME were at least twice as high as they should be for current bed usage and deaths in the NHS. \"Basically, their healthcare demand model is wrong, at least for the UK,\" he said.\n\nThe IHME said its model was designed to be updated from day to day as the pandemic goes on. For a country such as the UK, which is quite early on in its outbreak, the uncertainty was higher and the headline numbers might change over the next few days as more data is collected.\n\nThe high predicted numbers of UK deaths were driven by three factors, the IHME said: what had happened in other countries that are ahead in their epidemics, such as Italy and Spain, what had happened so far in the UK, and when physical distancing measures were put in place.\n\nIn the early stages of the UK outbreak, deaths climbed steeply, which the IHME says is a major driver of predicted deaths. The flirtation in government with the idea of \"herd immunity\" as a way out of the epidemic meant there was a delay in implementing physical distancing until 23 March, when there were already 54 deaths a day.\n\n\"We are expecting a foreboding few weeks for people in many parts of Europe,\" said the IHME director, Dr Christopher Murray. \"It seems likely the number of deaths will exceed our projections for the United States.\n\n\"It is unequivocally evident that social distancing can, when well implemented and maintained, control the epidemic, leading to declining death rates. Those nations hit hard early on implemented social distancing orders and may have the worst behind them as they are seeing important progress in reducing their death rates. Each nation's trajectory will change - and dramatically for the worse - if people ease up on social distancing or relax other precautions.\"\n\nMurray cautioned that easing these precautions too soon during the first wave of the pandemic could lead to new rounds of infections, hospitalisations and deaths. He defined the end of this \"wave\" as a ratio of 0.3 deaths per 1 million people.\n\n\"To decrease the risk of a second wave in places where the first wave is controlled by robust social distancing, governments would need to consider mass testing, contact tracing and quarantines for those infected until a vaccination is available, mass-produced and distributed widely,\" Murray said.", "source":

chief", "body": "The United Nations' biodiversity chief has called for a global ban on wildlife markets - such as the one in Wuhan, China, believed to be the starting point of the coronavirus outbreak - to prevent future pandemics.\n\nElizabeth Maruma Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, said countries should move to prevent future pandemics by banning \"wet markets\" that sell live and dead animals for human consumption, but cautioned against unintended consequences.\n\nChina has issued a temporary ban on wildlife markets where animals such as civets, live wolf pups and pangolins are kept alive in small cages while on sale, often in filthy conditions where they incubate diseases that can then spill into human populations. Many scientists have urged Beijing to make the ban permanent.\n\nUsing the examples of Ebola in west-central Africa and the Nipah virus in east Asia, Mrema said there were clear links between the destruction of nature and new human illnesses, but cautioned against a reactionary approach to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"The message we are getting is if we don't take care of nature, it will take care of us,\" she told the Guardian.\n\n\"It would be good to ban the live animal markets as China has done and some countries. But we should also remember you have communities, particularly from low-income rural areas, particularly in Africa, which are dependent on wild animals to sustain the livelihoods of millions of people.\n\n\"So unless we get alternatives for these communities, there might be a danger of opening up illegal trade in wild animals which currently is already leading us to the brink of extinction for some species.\n\n\"We need to look at how we balance that and really close the hole of illegal trade in the future.\"\n\nAs the coronavirus has spread around the world, there has been increased focus on how humanity's destruction of nature creates conditions for new zoonotic illness to spread.\n\nJinfeng Zhou, secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, called on authorities to make the ban on wildlife markets permanent, warning diseases such as Covid-19 would appear again.\n\n\"I agree there should be a global ban on wet markets, which will help a lot on wildlife conservation and protection of ourselves from improper contacts with wildlife,\" Zhou said. \"More than 70% of human diseases are from wildlife and many species are endangered by eating them.\"\n\nMrema said she was optimistic that the world would take the consequences of the destruction of the natural world more seriously in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak when countries returned to negotiate the post-2020 framework for biodiversity, billed as the Paris agreement for nature.\n\n\"Preserving intact ecosystems and biodiversity will help us reduce the prevalence of some of these diseases. So the way we farm, the way we use the soils, the way we protect coastal ecosystems and the way we treat our forests will either wreck the future or help us live longer,\" she said.\n\n\"We know in the late 1990s in Malaysia with the outbreak of Nipah virus, it is believed that the virus was a result of forest fires, deforestation and drought which had caused fruit bats, the natural carriers of the virus, to move from the forests into the peat farms. It infected the farmers, which infected other humans and that led to the spread of disease.\n\n\"Biodiversity loss is becoming a big driver in the emergence of some of these viruses. Large-scale deforestation, habitat degradation and fragmentation, agriculture intensification, our food system, trade in species and plants, anthropogenic climate change - all these are drivers of biodiversity loss and also drivers of new diseases. Two thirds of emerging infections and diseases now come from wildlife.\"\n\nIn February, delegates from more than 140 countries met in Rome to respond for the first time to a draft 20-point agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, including proposals to protect almost a third of the world's oceans and land and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%.\n\nA major summit to sign the agreement in October was scheduled in the Chinese city of Kunming but has been postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

"Draconian measures prevent some healthcare professions discussing their work during pandemic\n\nHealthcare professionals are being silenced and threatened with disciplinary action for speaking out about their work during the coronavirus outbreak, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nMany NHS staff are increasingly concerned that their ability to share stories about their work is being restricted by a clampdown on speaking out publicly.\n\nIt follows reports of doctors and nurses being gagged by hospitals and other NHS bodies from speaking out about widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Tactics have included threatening emails, the possibility of disciplinary action, and some people even being sent home from work.\n\nWhile there could be some logic to hospitals wanting to stop scaremongering when communications departments are overloaded with work at a busy time, many staff feel they are being blocked from highlighting their work during the pandemic.\n\nWorkers who have spoken to the Guardian say they fear being disciplined. Several professionals said they worried about losing their jobs. Examples include an email signed by the chief executive of one NHS trust forbidding all staff from talking to the media, and incidents where staff suspect emails and social media accounts are being monitored. Requests by staff to communications departments to permit them to talk to the press have been turned down, leaving staff anxious and fearful for their jobs during the worst global public health crisis of this century.\n\nOne nurse who wanted to highlight the vital role of his profession received an email (later recalled) from his trust to all staff, which banned public communications. When he contacted the communications department, he was shocked to receive a response saying simply no media. The team did not say what action they might take to enforce the ban, he said, but the tone was threatening..\n\nThe nurse added: \"As healthcare workers I think we feel generally quite secure - there's always work for nurses. But in my correspondence with the communications department I felt quite powerless all of a sudden. It makes me so sad.\" Ironically, he added, coronavirus has in fact led to the role of nurses being highlighted in a way they could never have otherwise dreamed of, including being featured on the front cover of glossy magazines.\n\nNot all NHS trusts in England have imposed a blanket ban on staff speaking out and some are encouraging professionals who wish to talk about their work. A range of staff recently explained their behind-the-scene roles to the Guardian, but most of those speaking out tend to be doctors, often in secure positions where they are less likely to be challenged or threatened.\n\nKate Jarman, director of corporate affairs at Milton Keynes University hospital NHS foundation trust, believes staff should be supported to talk about what life is like in their roles. \"There's always a balance to be struck in how staff get messages across,\" she said. \"People should be mindful of patient confidentiality and the core messages of public information and safety but from what I've seen, they are doing that.\"\n\nThe Guardian is aware of several cases where staff have been silenced. They include:\n\nA health professional who was left anxious for their job after their communications department found out they had spoken to a journalist about their work.\n\nStaff at one trust who faced disciplinary action for speaking out. A blanket email signed by one trust's chief executive was sent, warning staff not to speak to media under any circumstances. Some staff believe social media accounts are being monitored.\n\nHealthcare workers from different trusts who volunteered to be interviewed about their job in times of coronavirus and were told they could not mention the trust or their work at the hospital.\n\nOne hospital manager who said they had received guidance about press/media from the trust they worked for and would not be able to say anything for the foreseeable future.\n\nOne mental health worker working on a secure psychiatric ward who said they were terrified of speaking out publicly because they have been reprimanded by senior management before for highlighting aspects of patient care.\n\nUnions representing NHS staff have expressed their concerns. Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe, national officer for health at the Unite union, which represents 100,000 health staff, said officials had been hearing that some NHS bosses may have been clamping down on staff wishing to expose failings in the system and improve the wellbeing of patients.\n\nA spokesman from the Institute of Biomedical Science, a professional body for scientists, support staff and students, said members working for the NHS who wanted to talk about their vital role in the crisis were increasingly coming up against the same barriers. \"Hospital trusts in England are silencing our requests for members to talk.\"\n\nThe ramifications of such a clampdown at a time when NHS staff are risking their lives and being celebrated by the general public are chilling, but come as no surprise to some. Roger Kline, a research fellow at Middlesex University who has done a lot of work looking into whistleblowing, said: \"Old habits die hard, and I've certainly been contacted by NHS and social care staff anxious about going public and nervous about challenging local managers.\"\n\nOne mental health professional told the Guardian that the unspoken rule is that staff should keep their heads down, follow orders and say nothing. \"When it comes to the day-to-day clinical issues and challenges we face, there is a definite power dynamic at play, and [we] are generally petrified to speak out,\" they said.\n\nPreventing people from speaking out about their work is not only happening in the UK. In the US, hospitals are threatening to fire healthcare workers who publicise their working conditions during the coronavirus pandemic - and have in some cases followed through.", "source": {"uri":

"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/how-to-make-no-sew-face-mask-coronavirus", "title": "How to make a non-medical coronavirus face mask - no sewing required", "body": "The US Centers for Disease Control now recommends that all Americans wear face masks in public to reduce transmission of Covid-19. Because there are widespread shortages of medical-grade face masks, and leaders and experts agree those should be reserved for healthcare providers, individuals are largely making face masks at home.\n\nJeremy Howard, a University of San Francisco researcher and the co-founder of Masks 4 All, explains how to create your own, with no sewing required.\n\nVersion one - the T-shirt facemask:\n\nStart with an old T-shirt, preferably 100% cotton - anything will do, as long as it's not too thin - and outline the pattern of the mask. The bottom line should go just beneath the armpits of the shirt. Make sure the part that goes on your face is large enough to cover your nose and mouth.\n\nCut along the lines through both sides of the shirt so that your mask has two layers.\n\nPlace a safety pin along the bottom and insert a piece of paper towel or coffee filter in between the two layers of the T-shirt. This acts as an additional filter, and rests on top of the safety pin.\n\nSecure the mask around the front of your face, covering your nose and mouth. Tie the top straps under the back of your head and the bottom straps at the top of your head. That will ensure a nice fit underneath your chin. By covering your mouth, you have now protected those around you, and the better the fit, the more you're going to also protect yourself.\n\nVersion two - the handkerchief face mask:\n\nStart with a handkerchief and two hair ties. Rubber bands are okay as well, although they will be less comfortable.\n\nFollow the handkerchief in half, along a horizontal axis, and make a nice crease.\n\nPlace piece of paper towel or coffee filter at the center of the handkerchief. Fold the top down and the bottom up, so that the coffee filter or paper towel rests in the fold.\n\nPlace your first elastic about one-third of the way in from the edge of the handkerchief. Place the second elastic one-third of the way in from the other side. The two elastics should be about one hand-width apart.\n\nFold the left side in toward the center and then fold the right side in toward the center, tucking the right side into the left-side flap.\n\nUsing and taking care of your mask:\n\nDon't wear it at home, and don't wear it in the car, unless you're with people outside your regular family group. Don't wear it more than necessary - just wear it when you're in a public place, like a supermarket, where you might be within 6ft of people. It may not be necessary in a park or on a quiet street with few pedestrians, when you're moving around.\n\nDon't remove the mask until you're at home or in a place where you can wash your hands and avoid coming within 6ft of other people. When you do remove the mask, avoid touching the front of it in case you breathed in infected droplets that could now be there.\n\nRemove and dispose of the paper towel insert. Place the rest of the mask in soapy water, soak it for two minutes, then wash and rinse. Any kind of soap - dish soap, laundry detergent, hand soap - will do. Then wash your hands, and disinfect with bleach or alcohol anything you touched after taking off the mask. Never reuse a mask without washing it first.\n\nNext time you wear the mask, remember to replace the paper-towel insert.\n\nIf you have symptoms - a stuffy nose, a cough, a fever - stay inside.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_renwick@theguardian.com", "name": "Danielle Renwick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handkerchief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_towel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paper towel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_filter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coffee filter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_pin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safety pin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Howard_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Howard (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_San_Francisco", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surgical mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elasticity (physics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filtration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rubber band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinfectant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Mardi_Gras", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Mardi Gras", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2020/04/06/face-mask.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=dfcd075504e56aca0efec4b6dfe1e839", "eventUri": "eng-5658814", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 16177}, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 16177, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6029449107", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-12", "time": "12:40:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-12T12:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-12T12:12:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/12/tim-brooke-taylor-dies-at-79-after-contracting-coronavirus-agent-says", "title": "Tim Brooke-Taylor dies at 79 after contracting coronavirus, agent says", "body": "The comedian and actor Tim Brooke-Taylor has died after contracting coronavirus, his agent has said.

Don't believe the hype\n\nTrump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.\n\nHowever, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier V\u00e9ran, France's health minister, saying that it shouldn't be used by anyone with the exception of \"serious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision\".\n\nWe reported a few hours ago that earlier on Sunday Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top doctor on infectious diseases and a key member of the White House task force, was adamant there was nothing to suggest hydroxychloroquine had any benefit against coronavirus.\n\nMy colleague Richard Luscombe wrote:\n\n\"In terms of science, I don't think we can definitively say it works,\" he told CBS's Face the Nation.\n\n\"The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect.\"\n\nDr James Phillips, professor of emergency medicine at George Washington University hospital, said Americans could be risking their health if they followed the president's advice to take a drug for a condition for which it had not been tested.\n\n\"We don't know enough to make medical recommendations,\" he told CNN's Reliable Sources.\n\n\"It's a dangerous message for someone without a medical license to get up there and tell people to try it. You need to listen to physicians, people who understand science, before you go willy-nilly into the medicine cabinet.\"\n\nFauci has been reluctant to directly criticise the president, with whom he speaks regularly, but has found himself repeatedly having to contradict the president over hydroxychloroquine, which has become a hobby horse at White House briefings.\n\nOn 21 March, the day after another nationally-televised Trump claim that the drug \"looked promising\", Fauci was asked directly if it could be used to treat Covid-19.\n\n\"The answer is no,\" he said.\n\nHere is what happened when a reporter asked Fauci about the drug at Sunday evening's White House press briefing.\n\nIn case you missed it, here are the main points from the White House press briefing that concluded a few minutes ago:\n\nTrump said he is seeing glimmers of hope, \"light at the end of the tunnel\" thanks to work of medical workers and Americans' social distancing. Fauci reiterated this is going to be a very bad week as the curve flattens, but that they hope that it will get better in the weeks after. After the peak, mitigation is key to make sure it doesn't rebound. Trump repeatedly says Americans should try the untested drug hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus, said his administration has ordered 29m doses to be distributed across the United States. Fema is airlifitng supplies to affected states, including millions of masks, gloves, and sterile gowns. Trump took the opportunity to take digs at the governor of Illinois, CNN and a reporter from the Associated Press, calling CNN \"fake news\" for asking about the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and telling the AP reporter, \"You should be thanking them, not always asking wise guy questions.\"\n\nHello and welcome to today's live coronavirus pandemic coverage with me, Helen Sullivan.\n\nAs global cases approach 1.3 million and China is no longer in among the five worst-affected countries, Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital, ten days after testing positive for coronavirus.\n\nYou can get in touch throughout the day directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan.\n\nDonald Trump says US government has ordered 29m doses of hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria for which testing for its use to treat coronavirus is still under way. The drug has potentially harmful side effects. Personal protective gear is also being airlifted to US affected states, including millions of masks, gloves, and sterile gowns. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests after showing persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after announcing that he had tested positive for the virus.\n\nScotland's chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood has resigned after being criticised for not following her own social distancing guidance by visiting her second home. Ireland's premier Leo Varadkar has re-registered as a medical practitioner and will work one shift a week during the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. Some 1,000 migrants have been placed under quarantine after an outbreak of Covid-19 at a camp at Hal Far in the south of Malta. The camp has been was surrounded by police and army trucks. Daily death tolls slowed on Sunday in Italy, Spain and France. Italy registered 525 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday, the lowest daily rate since March 19. Spain recorded 674 deaths in the past 24 hours - the lowest daily death toll reported since March 26. In France, 357 people died from Covid-19 in hospitals, compared with 441 in the previous 24 hours. Sweden's government is drawing up legislation to allow it to take \"extraordinary steps\" to tackle Covid-19. On Sunday, Sweden reported a total of 401 deaths - an 8% increase from Saturday. Belgium's coronavirus outbreak appears to be reaching its peak according to reports after the number of intensive care hospitalisations rose from 1,245 to 1,261, while Austria's the daily rate of new infections has fallen significantly in recent days. A tiger at New York City's Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the coronavirus, in the first known case of Covid-19 in an animal in the US, a zoo spokesman told Reuters on Sunday. Ethiopia, Haiti and Barbados have reported their first coronavirus deaths. Pakistan has quarantined 20,000 worshippers and is looking for tens of thousands of others who attended a religious event in Lahore in March. Authorities want to test or quarantine 100,000 people who were at the event held by the Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary movement. Lebanon has started repatriating nationals in its first flights in weeks since it closed its international airport in response to the pandemic. Authorities said more than 20,000 people had signed up to be repatriated. Pope Francis has celebrated Palm Sunday mass without the public due to the pandemic, which he said should focus people's attention on what's most important. Singapore reported its highest one-day increase with 120 new cases of the virus on Sunday, compared to 75 on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_milman@theguardian.com", "name": "Oliver Milman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "helen_sullivan@theguardian.com", "name": "Helen Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

officials and British economist to use guide to help city thrive in balance with planet\n\nA doughnut cooked up in Oxford will guide Amsterdam out of the economic mess left by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhile straining to keep citizens safe in the Dutch capital, municipality officials and the British economist Kate Raworth from Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute have also been plotting how the city will rebuild in a post-Covid-19 world.\n\nThe conclusion? Out with the global attachment to economic growth and laws of supply and demand, and in with the so-called doughnut model devised by Raworth as a guide to what it means for countries, cities and people to thrive in balance with the planet.\n\nRaworth's 2017 bestselling book, Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist, has graced the bedside table of people ranging from the former Brexit secretary David Davis to the Guardian columnist George Monbiot, who described it as a \"breakthrough alternative to growth economics\".\n\nThe inner ring of her donut sets out the minimum we need to lead a good life, derived from the UN's sustainable development goals and agreed by world leaders of every political stripe. It ranges from food and clean water to a certain level of housing, sanitation, energy, education, healthcare, gender equality, income and political voice. Anyone not attaining such minimum standards is living in the doughnut's hole.\n\nThe outer ring of the doughnut, where the sprinkles go, represents the ecological ceiling drawn up by earth-system scientists. It highlights the boundaries across which human kind should not go to avoid damaging the climate, soils, oceans, the ozone layer, freshwater and abundant biodiversity.\n\nBetween the two rings is the good stuff: the dough, where everyone's needs and that of the planet are being met.\n\nOn Wednesday, the model will be formally embraced by the municipality of Amsterdam as the starting point for public policy decisions, the first city in the world to make such a commitment.\n\n\"I think it can help us overcome the effects of the crisis\", said Amsterdam's deputy mayor, Marieke van Doorninck, who joined Raworth in an interview with the Guardian via Skype before the launch. \"It might look strange that we are talking about the period after that but as a government we have to ... It is to help us to not fall back on easy mechanisms.\"\n\n\"When suddenly we have to care about climate, health, and jobs and housing and care and communities, is there a framework around that can help us with all of that?\" Raworth says. \"Yes there is, and it is ready to go.\"\n\nThe central premise is simple: the goal of economic activity should be about meeting the core needs of all but within the means of the planet. The \"doughnut\" is a device to show what this means in practice.\n\nRaworth scaled down the model to provide Amsterdam with a \"city portrait\" showing where basic needs are not being met and \"planetary boundaries\" overshot. It displays how the issues are interlinked.\n\n\"It is not just a hippy way at looking at the world,\" says Van Doorninck, citing the housing crisis as an example.\n\nResidents' housing needs are increasingly not being satisfied, with almost 20% of city tenants unable to cover their basic needs after paying their rent, and just 12% of approximately 60,0000 online applicants for social housing being successful.\n\nOne solution might be to build more homes but Amsterdam's doughnut highlights that the area's carbon dioxide emissions are 31% above 1990 levels. Imports of building materials, food and consumer products from outside the city boundaries contribute 62% of those total emissions.\n\nVan Doorninck says the city plans to regulate to ensure builders use materials that are as often possible recycled and bio based, such as wood. But the doughnut approach also encourages policymakers to lift their eyes to the horizon.\n\n\"The fact that houses are too expensive is not only to do with too few being built. There is a lot of capital flowing around the world trying to find an investment, and right now real estate is seen as the best way to invest, so that drives up prices,\" she says.\n\n\"The doughnut does not bring us the answers but a way of looking at it, so that we don't keep on going on in the same structures as we used to.\"\n\nThe port of Amsterdam is the world's single largest importer of cocoa beans, mostly from west Africa, where the labour is often highly exploitative.\n\nAs an independent private company it could reject such products and take the economic hit, but at the same time almost one in five households in Amsterdam qualify for social benefits due to low incomes and savings.\n\nVan Doorninck says the port is looking at how it moves on from dependence on fossil fuels as part of the city's new vision, and she expects that to naturally evolve into a wider debate over other pressing dilemmas brought to the forefront by the doughnut model.\n\n\"It gives space to talk about whether you want to be the place where products are being stored that are produced by child labour or by other forms of labour exploitation,\" she says.\n\nRaworth adds: \"Who would expect in a portrait of the city of Amsterdam that you would include labour rights in west Africa? And that is the value of the tool.\"\n\nBoth recognise the need for national government and supranational authorities to get on board. Raworth's last meeting just before the lockdown in Belgium was with the European commission in Brussels, where she says great interest was expressed.\n\n\"The world is experiencing a series of shocks and surprise impacts which are enabling us to shift away from the idea of growth to 'thriving', Raworth says. \"Thriving means our wellbeing lies in balance. We know it so well in the level of our body. This is the moment we are going to connect bodily health to planetary health.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

government has signalled an end to the human consumption of dogs, with the agriculture ministry today releasing a draft policy that would forbid canine meat.\n\nCiting the \"progress of human civilisation\" as well as growing public concern over animal welfare and prevention of disease transmission from animals to humans, China's Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs singled out canines as forbidden in a draft \"white list\" of animals allowed to be raised for meat.\n\nThe ministry called dogs a \"special companion animal\" and one not internationally recognised as livestock.\n\nThe city of Shenzhen recently approved the first ever mainland China ban on consumption of dog and cat meat, a move that has given hope to animal welfare groups worldwide that other parts of the country could soon follow suit. The new draft policy has provided even more.\n\n\"The signal is the first ever from a ministry that dogs are not food animals,\" Paul Littlefair, international head of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told the Guardian. \"[This] leaves the door open for local governments to follow Shenzhen's lead.\"\n\nWhile not officially a ban on the consumption of dog meat, the draft policy from the agriculture ministry could be a \"game changer moment for animal welfare in China\", Wendy Higgins of Humane Society International (HSI) told the Guardian.\n\n\"That signals a major shift, recognising that most people in China don't eat dogs and cats and want an end to the theft of their companion animals for a meat trade that only a small percentage of the population indulge in,\" Higgins said.\n\nHSI estimates that between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed in China for their meat annually, while Animals Asia puts the figure for cats at around 4 million per year.\n\nMost of these are stolen animals and not raised in captive breeding facilities, Higgins said.\n\n\"Not only does it cause enormous animal suffering, but it is also almost entirely fuelled by crime and, perhaps most significantly right now, poses an undeniable human health threat with the risk of diseases such as rabies and cholera,\" she said.\n\nThe updated agriculture ministry list includes the addition of several wildlife species allowed to be farmed under animal husbandry laws if the policy is not altered following a public comment period that runs through May 8.\n\nWildlife such as deer, game birds, along with mink, two kinds of foxes, and other animals were included on a list of animals expected to be approved as farm-raised species once China's central government lifts a ban on the wildlife trade.\n\nThe temporary wildlife trade ban was imposed from late January in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, largely thought to have originated in the formal or illicit wildlife supply chain.\n\nBut campaigners hope the government will go still further. Peter Li, China Policy Specialist with HSI, told the Guardian: \"Listing wild animals, including foxes and raccoon dogs, as 'special livestock' is concerning. Rebranding wildlife as livestock doesn't alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in farm environments, their welfare needs simply can't be met. In addition, there's clear evidence that some of these species can act as intermediate hosts of viruses, such as Covid-19, which is why we're urging China and all governments to stop trading in wildlife.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_standaert@theguardian.com", "name": "Michael Standaert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animal welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Society_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humane Society International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canine tooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Animals", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transmission (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_(hunting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game (hunting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_breeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captive breeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cholera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rabies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Anime", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Anime", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Training", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Training", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f53031009cc0ea635fc37a53985ba90f7e53d4/0_231_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c910dac05624a809c0d5bf689618ea60", "eventUri": "eng-5674946", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 14071}, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 14071, "relevance": 2}, {"uri": "6028160296", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-11", "time": "04:23:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-11T04:23:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-11T04:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.501960813999176, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/11/positively-alpine-disbelief-air-pollution-falls-lockdown-coronavirus", "title": "'It's positively alpine!'

Yet it is countered with one cruel irony: with most residents of these cities strictly confined to their homes, few have any way to appreciate this newly fresh air, except through an open window or a during speedy trip to the supermarket.\n\nIn Delhi, air quality index (AQI) levels are usually a severe 200 on a good day (anything above 25 is deemed unsafe by World Health Organization). During peak pollution periods last year they soared well into a life-threatening 900 and sometimes off the measurable scale. But as Delhi's 11m registered cars were taken off the roads and factories and construction were ground to a halt, AQI levels have regularly fallen below 20. The skies are suddenly a rare, piercing blue. Even the birdsong seems louder.\n\nDr Shashi Tharoor, a politician and author who has been vocal on environmental issues, said he hoped that it was a wake-up call. \"The blissful sight of blue skies and the joy of breathing clean air provides just the contrast to illustrate what we are doing to ourselves the rest of the time,\" said Tharoor. \"Today the typical Delhi AQI hovers around 30 and one blissful afternoon, after a spurt of rain, it dropped to 7.\"\n\n\"Seven,\" Tharoor exclaimed again in disbelief. \"In Delhi! Pure joy!\".\n\nTharoor's sister Smita, who was visiting from London when the lockdown was imposed and found herself stuck in Delhi, was equally effusive. As someone with asthma, she said the city's air, normally thick with pollution, was usually a health nightmare. But now: \"The air is clear, the skies are blue. I see the evening stars with clarity and hear the chirruping of excited birds at this unexpected bonus they have received.\"\n\nWhile India's powerful car lobby has long disputed that cars are a major cause of Delhi's pollution, Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment, said the lockdown and resulting rapid drop in pollution showed once and for all just what a polluting role vehicles had in the city.\n\nNarain also stressed that while she wished Delhi was like this \"all the time\", adding: \"I don't want people to say 'Oh, environmentalists are celebrating this lockdown:' we are not. This is not the solution. But whatever the new normal is post-Covid-19, we have to make sure we take this breath of fresh air and think about the serious efforts we need to deal with pollution in Delhi.\"\n\nIt is not just Delhi experiencing the clearest skies in years. As pollution dropped to its lowest level in three decades this week this week, residents of Jalandhar in Punjab woke up to an incredible sight in the distance: the Dhauladhar mountain range in Himachal Pradesh. The peaks, which are over 120 miles away, had not been sighted on the Punjab horizon for almost 30 years.\n\nIt is the absence of cars on some of the world's most congested roads that seems to be making the most crucial differences. Thailand's capital, Bangkok, which only last month had closed schools because the pollution got so bad, has experienced a similar transformation in the air since partial lockdown, mainly due to the fall in road traffic. \"We can see quite a big gap between the air quality standard that we have [compared with this time last year],\" says Tara Buakamsri, Thailand director for Greenpeace.\n\nBut residents of Bangkok lamented how the places to enjoy the fresh air were swiftly disappearing. Playgrounds, sporting grounds and even parks, a rare source of solace in the bustling, intensely urban environs of Bangkok, have all now been shut. \"I feel sad for the old people who use the park to hang out and meet friends. I think they will be so sad at home,\" said Nantawan Wangudomsuk, 31, a producer who used to run in the parks.\n\nAcross South America's most populous city of S\u00e3o Paulo, ground zero of Brazil's brewing coronavirus crisis, notorious traffic queues and smoggy horizons are also giving way to calm streets and clearer skies.\n\nDuring weekday rush-hour, downtown S\u00e3o Paulo's Jo\u00e3o Goulart elevated highway - nicknamed Minhoc\u00e3o, the Big Worm - normally heaves with traffic as thousands of cars cram four narrow lanes and beeping motorbikes weave through daringly small spaces. But with the city's coronavirus lockdown, Minhoc\u00e3o now resembles a small-town avenue instead of a major road in a metropolis of 12 million people.\n\n\"The air is certainly better,\" said Daniel Guth,an urban mobility consultant. \"I've felt the improvement in air quality both as a cyclist and as a quarantined citizen,\" he laughed. \"We should use this as a moment to reflect on what transport methods we should prioritise when this crisis is over.\"\n\nDespite being under lockdown, many Paulistas, as the city's residents are known, are still finding ways to enjoy the cleaner air, taking to windows and apartment balconies for nightly pot-banging protests against Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly dismissed the coronavirus as just \"a little flu\".\n\nBogot\u00e1, the sprawling mountaintop capital of Colombia, is also usually choking with traffic so bad that officials occasionally ban cars for entire days. But since the nationwide coronavirus quarantine took hold on 24 March, exhaust fumes have fallen as the city ground to a halt. Yet the newly fresh air has been taunting Bogot\u00e1's residents, who are allowed to leave home only for food and medicines, not even a daily dose of outdoor exercise. \"Without a doubt this pandemic is helping us improve air quality,\" said Carolina Urrutia, Bogot\u00e1's district environment secretary. \"With the city shut down, we are able to focus our efforts on other environmental factors.\"\n\nCali, Colombia's third city and usually a smokey, congested metropolis, has also been spared from the usual forest fires, allowing residents to breathe fresher air. \"The thick cloud that usually hangs over us has been lifted,\" said Christian Camilo Villa, an air quality activist and Cali resident. \"The concern is that it will return when the quarantine ends.\"\n\nIndeed, the fear among environmentalists and residents is that, rather than attempting to maintain the low levels of pollution in the world's biggest capitals, when industry and cars kick back into action post-lockdown, the situation will go back to square one, and perhaps even worsen, as people and industry attempt to make up for the lost months.\n\nThe signs from China, which is coming out of the other side of the coronavirus outbreak and where lockdowns are loosening up, are not positive. For the first four weeks after the Chinese new year holiday in late January, when the coronavirus outbreak was at its worst, pollution levels fell 25% across the country. But since early March, levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution have begun to inch back up as the country gets back to work with factories, businesses and power plants re-opening and traffic returning.\n\nLauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said: \"The big question is whether government stimulus measures lead to pollution levels rebounding above the levels before the crisis, like happened after the 2008 financial crisis.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/uk-coronavirus-deaths-preventable-government-account", "title": "10,000 UK coronavirus deaths: don't forget that this was preventable | Nesrine Malik", "body": "Cast your mind back four weeks. Coronavirus deaths in the UK were in the tens, and the disease was ravaging Italy. The daily death tolls from Italy and then Spain were reported every 24 hours and the numbers were staggering, unfathomable and rising. Italy was \"overwhelmed\", succumbing to a tragic scenario because of quarantine enforcement failures, and an inability to predict how quickly the disease would be transmitted. The highest daily death toll recorded in Italy was on 28 March, with 971 deaths. Spain's highest came five days later with 950. On Friday, the death toll in UK hospitals was 980.\n\nThe UK is now surpassing the apocalyptic tolls we fixated on just two weeks ago. The same tragedies are unfolding across our country. Doctors and nurses are dying, exposed to heavy viral loads and often without adequate protective equipment. Covid-19 wards are saturated, echoing the calls of distress from Italian medical staff, as the specific shifts of doctors and nurses disappear and blend into one long coronavirus rota. But the sense of distress with which the Italian scenario was reported and received in the UK is strangely absent. Missing too is the urgent need to understand why this is happening.\n\nNot only did the UK have the experience of Italy play out before the virus hit its own shores, illustrating clearly the measures that needed to be taken, it had explicit warnings from Italians spelling out the pitfalls to be avoided. Voices called out to the UK and foretold the mistakes that would cost lives. On 27 March, the Italian author Francesca Melandri wrote a letter to the UK from \"our future\": \"We watch you as you behave just as we did. You hold the same arguments we did until a short time ago, between those who still say, 'It's only a flu, why all the fuss?' and those who have already understood.\"\n\nIt is a jarring experience to wake up to a British death toll that is almost a thousand a day, and not see that number on every front page, being put to every politician in every single interview, with a demand for an explanation. It is as if those who should be asking these questions, from the media to opposition politicians, have been subjected to a mass memory-erasing exercise. Every report showing the scale of the crisis should be framed in the language of accountability and anchored in the premise of preventability. With all the benefits of hindsight, the government dragged its feet, wasted precious time and infused the issue with a sense of British exceptionalism: drastic measures need not be taken because in the UK things will somehow be different.\n\nIf there was any chance of that interrogation happening, it was made even less likely by Boris Johnson's illness. The nation's tragedy became secondary to his infection. It is understandable that the hospitalisation of a nation's premier - a unique and destabilising event - should concern the media and government. But Johnson's illness was folded into a larger, editorialised narrative about his martyrdom and indefatigability, turning his sickness and recovery into a virtue of character. And as that hagiography was being enthusiastically written in large parts of the press, the stories of the thousands of dead and grieving were buried under daily updates of the prime minister's \"high spirits\" from his ICU bed. Questions over his responsibility for the national carnage - his complacent messaging over shaking hands with the afflicted, his delay in shutting down the country, his \"herd immunity\" policy, the ongoing lack of testing, of equipment and of ventilators - were not asked. The organisers of Cheltenham festival, which attracted more than 250,000 people from 10 to 13 March, justified going ahead by citing the presence of Johnson at an international rugby match a few days before.\n\nThe terminology of war did much of the work. The virus was framed in the context of an enemy to be fought in the trenches, rather than a series of public health policy failures. The death toll became not a daily count of individual devastation, but a cold sterile ticker of battle casualties. The Queen's message, a call for noble resolve, further generalised the crisis into an act of God that we must weather by mobilising the powers of the British national character. It's now a matter of grit, of reaching into our reserves to see us through until we meet again.\n\nDespite the extent of the crisis, many doctors and nurses fear speaking on the record. Over the past few days I have received WhatsApp messages from NHS staff too afraid even to email them in case the paper trail leads to disciplinary action - detailing horrors of an NHS stretched thin, of ill-protected staff doing 36-hour shifts. They will be clapped every week, as the government claims to champion the NHS, yet gagged if they dare raise concerns. There is an effort to silence voices such as that of Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a doctor who appealed publicly for protective equipment, only to perish from coronavirus days later. The official line last Tuesday was that we could be \"moving in the right direction\". That day, the death toll almost doubled to 786.\n\nThe contrast between the numbers and the jadedness with which we meet them is down to some daily numbing effect, no doubt. This is made worse by the fact there are other exceptional circumstances to reckon with as we deal with self-isolation, loss of income and disruption to work and personal lives. And then there's the time lag. It's hard, as we lock down, to nurture an outrage that is based on decisions in the past when the loss of life is happening today - more so when the government has stealthily removed itself from the picture and shifted the responsibility entirely on to the public, responding to any concerns by robotically repeating the mantra: \"Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives\". So, as lives are extinguished in their hundreds every day, we become busied with questions of policing, of social distancing, of shutting down parks, rather than on the government's failed policymaking.\n\nSo, again, cast your mind back four weeks. Remember how it felt to see those numbers from Italy, how our hearts sank every time they went up by the hundreds, how we envisioned those numbers as terrorised citizens facing the end of their lives. Remember how we reeled at the thought that they all had families and friends whom they could not contact in their final moments, and who are now devastated by their loss. Relocate the pain and recall that this need not have happened. Ten thousand people, in UK hospitals alone, have now died.\n\n* Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

"Day 19 of lockdown, and some Britons have identified a greater enemy than even the Wuhan wet market's snack counter, home to the most maligned bat since Val Kilmer. That deadly foe is the 5G rollout, linked by some conspiracists to the coronavirus. Attempts to defeat it have so far seen at least 20 5G towers set fire to around the country, hampering emergency communication and the channels used by critical workers responding to the current crisis. Great job, guys! It's the equivalent of destroying air-raid sirens during the blitz because you heard they turn you Nazi.\n\nThis wildly mushrooming conspiracy seems driven in part by anti-vaxxers, who've apparently tired of endangering lives one way and need a new thrill, a bit like when the Zodiac killer switched from firearms to knives. But only in part - it also takes in far-right YouTube wingnuts, galaxy-brained celebrities, InfoWars, David Icke, Russia Today... the full catastrophe, basically.\n\nWe all have newfound respect for supermarkets, though, not simply because visiting one is now the going-out equivalent of hitting a nightclub. I truly salute the staff for adapting to the exhausting demands of our new reality, as well as relaxing their rules on letting in single men. Plus it's a novelty to meet a breed of doorman who isn't going to end up in a news report concluding with the words \"the trial continues\". That said, we must as always make a distinction between the supermarket workers and the supermarket bosses. Tesco took \u00a3585m bailout tax relief, and promptly paid \u00a3635m dividends to its biggest investors, some of which are the richest institutions on Earth.\n\nIn other business news, despite more than 300,000 inquiries, just 2,500 government-backed loans have been granted . You might have been surprised to learn the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was surprised to learn banks weren't lending, despite the fact he'd told them to. Alas, the thing about the banks is that you can't bank on them. The Conservative party's relationship with the banks is basically Dot Cotton's relationship with her son, Nick. Maybe he's changed this time, you know?\n\nLabour news continues to have all the reach of a secret diary. Newly elected leader Keir Starmer has brought back Ed Miliband, the man famously identified as a chaos harbinger by David Cameron. Which has turned out to be rather like being identified as slightly creepy by Jimmy Savile.\n\nBut for better or worse, Miliband's highest-profile outings in recent years have been as pixels in the notorious Cameron tweet. In the madly accelerated times in which we live, Ed already seems like a relic from a different geological age. If only there was some sort of Rosetta-type stone that might be discovered to help us decipher the ancient times from whence he hails.\n\nAt least celebrities are leading the lives of anonymity they have always claimed to crave, a piece of wish fulfilment that has forced them to emerge only hourly to invade their own privacy with Instagram videos of them failing winsomely at basic household tasks. If you've caught any of these, you'll be enjoying what amounts to an emergent \"I can't believe I'm cleaning!\" genre, though will likely side with the washing machine in any content labelled #mywashingmachinehatesme.\n\nThe question on much of the media's lips this week has been: how long will the lockdown last? You wonder what's behind the government's refusal to give a straight answer along the lines of \"many weeks more\". An aversion to spoilers? Maybe it welcomes the distraction. On Thursday, Dominic Raab intoned that this crisis had \"made us think long and hard about who the key workers are in our lives\". Not that hard, as it turned out. Also on Thursday, the government sneaked out its points-based immigration planning, which ranks many of the same \"essential workers\" somewhere between convicted foreign sex killers and people who tick yes to the visa inquiry \"Have you ever been involved in preparing an act of terrorism?\". Or to put it the way the official Home Office guidance prefers: \"There will not be an immigration route specifically for those who do not meet the skills or salary threshold for the skilled worker route.\" Forgive me if even mentioning the people getting us through it constitutes some kind of crisis faux pas. For some, ignoring the realities low-paid nurses or delivery workers face is key to the spirit of national togetherness.\n\nOne of the unwritten conventions of British public life is that no matter how ill-advised or ill-prepared any military action we've committed to is, once it starts, you get behind the troops. The government keeps telling us this current crisis is a war, so in the spirit of speaking their preferred language, I guess the troops are us. Not them: they're the generals. So let me be clear that I'm very much getting behind us, and thank us for our service.\n\nBut when we're seeing 1,000 casualties a day - just as we did in Italy while our generals were still deciding not to act - and grave problems with testing, and NHS staff are crying out daily for the right kit, it's certainly worth considering whether the troops were led into an ambush. The people dying right now are likely to have caught the disease in the middle of last month (between 11 and 21 March), when the government's advisers reportedly surmised the British people would never accept a lockdown. It's - how to put this blandly enough not to offend the free-speech snowflakes out there? - OK to wonder if we might have expected better.\n\nInstead, though, there's a sort of meth-assisted Boys' Own quality to some of the more obsessive lines of inquiry. This week, there was some focus on whether Dominic Raab had written the so-called \"letters of last resort\", replacing the versions of them Boris Johnson wrote when he took office, which contain instructions for who takes military charge in the event of the nuclear obliteration of the government. It's an interesting question, isn't it? A thousand people are dying every day and some members of the lobby would very much like to know if Mr Raab has written to a submarine captain.\n\nThen again, given the seismic collapse in ad revenues, it looks like all of us journalists are going to need to retrain into different careers after this, so it's probably good to showcase alternative skill sets. On this evidence, a few would make excellent submarine crew, because they seem pretty relaxed about waiting to find out what the fuck happened until six months after the event.\n\nMaybe at some subconscious level, people thought this level of fatality was something that just couldn't happen in the UK, like winning the Eurovision song contest or becoming a police state. It's funny how quickly you go from the old certainties to mildly watching Thursday's clip of the Northants police chief threatening to get his officers to search the contents of people's shopping baskets for items he deems non-essential. What can you say? In the spirit of national togetherness, my main takeout from this is that we should really commit to a Eurovision entry next year.\n\n* Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist", "source": {"uri":

"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug", "title": "Hydroxychloroquine: how an unproven drug became Trump's coronavirus miracle cure", "body": "This weekend, Donald Trump used his daily White House coronavirus briefings to again urge Americans to take hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that has not been shown to be safe or effective against Covid-19.\n\n\"What do you have to lose? Take it,\" the president said on Saturday as he boasted that the US had amassed 29m doses of the drug. On Sunday, facing questions from the press about his aggressive promotion of an unproven treatment, he argued against waiting for the completion of clinical trials. \"In France, they had a very good test,\" he said. \"But we don't have time to go and say, 'Gee, let's take a couple of years and test it out, and let's go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease doctor, has repeatedly warned that there is no conclusive evidence to support using the drug. Asked whether it should be considered a treatment for Covid-19, he said on 24 March: \"The answer is no.\"\n\nThe story of how hydroxychloroquine was anointed the Trump administration's miracle drug for the coronavirus pandemic is a distinctly modern tale of misinformation within a global information ecosystem beset by widespread uncertainty, fear, media fragmentation and hyper-partisanship. Belief in the drug's potential to cure patients infected with the virus followed an extraordinary trajectory from a small study conducted in France (Trump's \"very good test\") to Silicon Valley social media influencers, Fox News, and the largest bully pulpit: the White House.\n\nBut it's also a story as old as medicine itself. When an epidemic killed thousands in ancient Rome, said Aaron Shakow, a research associate at Harvard Medical School and historian of medicine, the chief physician of the emperor Nero circulated a recipe for an old miracle cure.\n\n\"It was an attempt by Nero to sustain his legitimacy in the midst of this catastrophic event,\" Shakow said. \"Epidemics are dangerous to rulers.\"\n\nA deeply flawed study\n\nIn early March, as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated its spread around the globe, a group of scientists in Marseilles, France, launched an experiment to see whether hydroxychloroquine, a well-known old malaria drug, could be what everyone was searching for: a cure.\n\nMost small scientific studies live and die within the rarified domain of academic journals, but the French trial had a much more auspicious debut. Before the study was even published, in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (IJAA), a lawyer falsely claiming an affiliation with Stanford University appeared on Fox News's Tucker Carlson Tonight to declare the results: a \"100% cure rate against coronavirus\". From Fox News, it was only a matter of time (hours, in fact) before the drug was being hailed as a \"game changer\" by the president of the United States.\n\nTrump made his first endorsement of hydroxychloroquine on 19 March. Export controls, shortages, overdoses, and scientific recriminations rapidly ensued, but the controversy could not extinguish the power of presidentially endorsed hope. Across the globe and throughout diverse communities on the internet, hydroxychloroquine had been anointed the miracle cure for Covid-19.\n\nThe only problem? The study that all this fervid hope is based on doesn't show what its authors claim it does.\n\nThe gold standard for a clinical trial is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). What this means in plain English is that the study has been designed to reduce biases that would render its results meaningless. Neither the physician nor the patients knows whether they received the drug (\"double-blinded\"), a safeguard that reduces the possibility that the doctor will treat the two groups differently. The researchers also do not get to choose which patients go into which group (\"randomized\") and the makeup of the two groups is roughly equivalent (\"controlled\").\n\nThe French hydroxychloroquine study did not follow any of these rules.\n\nThe treatment group and the control group were drawn from separate populations: the treatment group were all patients at the institution where the researchers worked, the M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection University Hospital Institute in Marseille, while the control patients came from other hospitals in the south of France. The treatment group (mean age 51.2) was significantly older than the control group (mean age 37.3), introducing another variable that could undermine the meaning of the results. The study was \"open label\", meaning the physicians and patients knew which treatment they were receiving. The French researchers also treated some but not all of the treatment group patients with azithromycin, a common antibiotic, another complicating factor that was not randomized.\n\nBut even more important than these shortcomings in the design of the study is how the researchers chose to measure and report their results. Forty-two patients were initially included in the study. Three were transferred to the intensive care unit; one died, one left the hospital, and one stopped taking the treatment due to nausea. The other 36 eventually recovered, and those who received the drug cleared the virus from the system faster than those who did not.\n\nIf you had only heard about this study from the Fox News assertion of a \"100% cure rate\", you might assume that the four patients with poor clinical outcomes (the three ICU visits and one death) had been unlucky enough to be in the group that did not receive the \"cure\".\n\nAnd yet, those four patients, as well as the patient with nausea and the one who left the hospital early, were all part of the treatment group. They were excluded from the topline results of the study because of the way that the researchers chose to measure and report the results: strictly based on the measurable presence of viruses in nasal swabs taken each day of the study. Since the patients were in the ICU or dead, their samples could not be taken and they were left out of the final analysis. Based on the nasal swabs of just the 36 patients who completed the study, those who received the drug cleared the virus from their systems faster than those who did not.\n\nThis is how an experiment in which 15% of the treatment group and 0% of the control had poor clinical outcomes could end up being reported as showing a \"100% cure rate\".\n\nOn 3 April, two weeks after the study was first published online, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the IJAA, said in a statement that the group's board \"believes the article does not meet the Society's expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety\".\n\nDidier Raoult, the corresponding author for the French study, did not respond to questions from the Guardian.\n\nAndrew Noymer, a professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, described the results of the French study as \"meaningless\". \"They should have done an RCT,\" he said.\n\n\"This idea that we're all manning the lifeboats and there's no time for that is just absurd,\" Noymer added. \"They could have already done it. They could have had the answer by now ... Doctors have always gone with their guts and saved many lives, but I don't know. If they had done RCTs on Thalidomide\" - a drug that caused birth defects - \"they would have figured out its dangers a lot sooner.\"\n\nFrom Silicon Valley to Fox News\n\nSo how did one interesting but flawed study out of the south of France make its way to Fox News's prime time and the White House?\n\nIt was not surprising that scientists were interested in testing hydroxychloroquine (and its close relative, chloroquine), a well-known and understood drug, as a potential treatment against Covid-19. It is one of a number of possible treatments that scientists in China and South Korea looked at in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, including with in vitro (ie lab-based) experiments that showed promising (though not conclusive) results. The drug was also selected as one of four that the World Health Organization included in its large-scale international clinical trial.\n\nBut while hydroxychloroquine was garnering some interest in the early days of the pandemic, other possible treatments, such as Gilead's antiviral Remdesivir, were drawing more. Google trends data shows that people were searching for Remdesivir more than hydroxychloroquine throughout most of February.\n\nWhat Remdesivir lacked that hydroxychloroquine had, however, was a team of dedicated hype men who appeared more interested in publicizing the drug as a cure than they were in discovering whether the drug was effective.\n\nAmong these is Raoult, the French physician who co-authored the hydroxychloroquine study in Marseille. Before Raoult had even begun his clinical trial, in late February, he appeared in the press to promote the idea of chloroquine as a treatment, researchers with First Draft News found. A video of the appearance received more than a quarter-million views on Facebook.\n\nRaoult also found a dedicated and effective English-language publicist in Gregory Rigano, the lawyer who appeared on Fox News with a chyron that falsely labeled him an \"adviser\" to Stanford Medical School. Rigano wrote a Google document promoting the use of chloroquine with James Todaro, a blockchain investor who received a medical degree from Columbia University but does not appear to practice. (The document initially listed a third co-author, a retired biochemist who disclaimed any knowledge of it when contacted by Wired.)\n\nThe Google document, which was formatted in a way that made it appear to be a scientific paper, found an audience among Silicon Valley's elite. It was shared on Twitter by a number of influential investors before it hit the virality motherlode: on 16 March, the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted the link to the document to his nearly 33m followers.\n\n\"When someone who is newsworthy or notable that has an enormous network on social media tweets about something that could be as path-breaking as a medicine that could treat coronavirus, everyone is going to pay attention no matter if that person has expertise or not,\" said Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change research project at Harvard's Shorenstein Center. \"Elon Musk elevating and giving voice to this Google doc does act as a validating mechanism. Elon Musk is a tech entrepreneur best known as a car salesman, but nevertheless people look to him for what's new, what's next.\"\n\nMusk's tweet received more than 13,000 retweets. (He did not respond to questions from the Guardian about his promotion of the document.) Search interest in chloroquine soared. Mainstream media outlets covered his apparent endorsement of the drug. An 85-year-old medication was well on its way to becoming a Covid-19 meme.\n\nAmerica's right wing piles on\n\nOnce Trump declared himself a proponent of hydroxychloroquine, the scientific debate over the drug was drowned out by a decidedly partisan one.\n\nRightwing media outlets have followed Fox News's lead (an analysis by Media Matters found that the cable news channel promoted using the drug 109 times between 23 March and 25 March) to become staunch proponents of the drug, from digital outrage factories such as the Daily Caller and the Daily Wire to the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"These drugs are helping our coronavirus patients,\" declared the headline of the Journal op-ed, which was written by two physicians from Kansas, Jeff Colyer and Daniel Hinthorn. The pair wrote that they had been treating patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and encouraged others to do so too \"as a matter of clinical practice\" once a patient tests positive. They also recommended using the drug prophylactically for healthcare workers.\n\nThe doctors did not provide any data from their own patients, but referenced the French study, writing: \"Researchers in France treated a small number of patients with both hydroxychloroquine and a Z-Pak, and 100% of them were cured by day six of treatment.\"\n\nHinthorn, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Kansas Medical Center, responded to queries from the Guardian about the op-ed's mischaracterization of the French study: \"You are correct. Any patient left out of any analysis makes us suspicious. But what this study told us was that this was a combination that might merit further evaluation.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that it is unknown whether the drug is beneficial or harmful for Covid-19 patients, but said that since no drug has as yet been proven effective, \"if there is any medication that might give hope, we prefer to try it\" as long as it is safe. \"We should know in the next few weeks whether such a regimen was a wise decision or not.\"\n\nHinthorn did not respond to a follow up question about whether the op-ed should be corrected to more accurately reflect the degree of uncertainty around hydroxychloroquine. Colyer, the former governor of Kansas and a plastic surgeon, did not respond to requests for comment. He has since written a second op-ed for the Journal, also promoting hydroxychloroquine.\n\nThe idea that hydroxychloroquine is \"the cure\" has taken off within certain online communities, including among anti-vaxxers and followers of QAnon, a rightwing conspiracy theory. The drug has also found support from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a small, ultra-conservative organization that advocates against government involvement in medicine. The group launched a texting campaign to bombard physicians with demands to sign a petition against \"red tape\" that might prevent them from prescribing the drug, Reuters reported.\n\nCalls for further research\n\nAway from the rancor of the partisan media, scientists and physicians continue to study the effects of the drug. In some states, including the hard-hit New York, hospitals are following Hinthorn's rationale and using the drug since no proven therapy exists.\n\nA group of French researchers published a refutation of the Raoult study in M\u00e9decine et Maladies Infectieuses on 30 March. The researchers, at Saint Louis Hospital in France, followed the same regimen of hydroxychloroquine for 11 patients, and did not have similar results. \"We found no evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical benefit of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of our hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19,\" they wrote. \"Ongoing randomized clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine should provide a definitive answer regarding the alleged efficacy of this combination and will assess its safety.\"\n\nBut another study - this time a randomized controlled trial - out of Wuhan, China, has sparked hope since it was circulated ahead of publication on 31 March. The trial of 62 patients found that patients with mild cases of Covid-19 who were treated with hydroxychloroquine recovered faster than those who did not - and none of them progressed to \"severe\" illness. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.\n\nThe authors of the study urged further research and large-scale clinical trials to better understand how the drug operates and how best to use it.\n\nThe danger of presidential misinformation\n\nThe hype around hydroxychloroquine has not been without casualties.\n\nHeightened demand for the drug has left longtime patients - including lupus patients who have long used it as an anti-inflammatory - forced to go without. Overdoses have also been reported in the US and Nigeria as frightened individuals attempt to self-medicate.\n\nSocial media companies, who have been proactive about policing misinformation about coronavirus, have taken some steps to counter the spread of false claims. Google took down the Google document by Rigano , though the company has not responded to numerous requests for an explanation. Twitter has also deleted tweets by the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, and the Fox News personality Laura Ingraham that touted the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.\n\nBut it's hard to see how these small enforcement actions by internet platforms can have much of an impact when the president of the United States continues to use his platform to promote the drug, as he did during his daily briefings on Saturday and again on Sunday.\n\nTrump's promotion of the drug has raised questions about his motivation, and on Monday the New York Times reported that the president holds \"a small personal financial interest\" in Sanofi, the company that makes a brandname version of hydroxychloroquine. (The drug's patent has expired so other pharmaceutical companies can manufacture generic versions.)\n\nAs a piece of viral misinformation, the hydroxychloroquine meme has amassed an extraordinary list of validators, starting with its placement in a respectable peer-reviewed journal. (Though misinformation stemming from academia is not without precedent; the paper that touched off the false belief in a link between autism and the measles vaccine was published in one of the most respected publications in medicine, and only retracted 12 years later.) It's also very difficult to refute, because none of the hydroxychloroquine narrative's critics can or will say anything definitive about its efficacy. Uncertainty and a call to await further study is a weak sword to bring to a fight against an overly confident propagandist.\n\nTrump's unscientific embrace of hydroxychloroquine is not common, but there are historical examples of heads of state spreading misinformation during pandemics. One recent, tragic example is the HIV-denialism of the South African president Thabo Mbeki, who rejected the use of antiretroviral drugs for his country's citizens and instead promoted nutritional remedies such as beetroot juice and garlic. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health ultimately placed the death toll of Mbeki's policies at approximately 330,000.\n\nNoymer, the UC Irvine epidemiologist, said that the two situations were not quite analogous, since hydroxychloroquine has a \"plausible mechanism\" to combat the coronavirus, while beetroot juice never did.\n\nStill, Noymer said that the influence that a president can have over a population's attitude toward a medicine or drug is significant. He recalled President Gerald Ford publicly receiving a flu shot in 1976, amid fear that a new swine flu could lead to a pandemic.\n\n\"There was a photograph of him rolling up a sleeve and getting a shot, and the uptake on the flu shot was enormous,\" Noymer said. \"When the president of the United States does something, it's quite the endorsement.\"\n\nAs for Trump, it does not appear likely that he will stop hyping the drug anytime soon, nor that he will take responsibility if anything goes wrong.\n\n\"What do you have to lose?\" he said Sunday. \"They say, take it. I'm not looking at it one way or the other ... If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn't do it early. I've seen things that I sort of like, so what do I know?\n\n\"I'm not a doctor.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

decision - latest news", "body": "At the high court in Brisbane, the situation is surreal.\n\nWe're told two or three journalists will be allowed into the courtroom; there are going on 20 sitting (a few metres apart) in a quiet foyer inside the courthouse.\n\nThe contrast between previous hearings of this case couldn't be more stark. There are no protesters or supporters on the doorstep; not even folks socially distancing. Just a bank of television cameras with no one to film coming in or out.\n\nIt looks certain that the high court will read its most anticipated criminal decision in history to a near-empty room.\n\nIt is worth noting that a third outcome is possible in today's judgment, as AAP reports today.\n\nThat could involve the initial Victorian appeal decision being reconsidered, either by the high court or by being sent back to the court of appeal.\n\nMy colleague Melissa Davey has been reporting on Pell's time in court from the start. She has filed this preview of what promises to be a momentous day for the Catholic church, and the nation.\n\nAs Melissa writes, Pell's legal team took his case to the high court after his appeal at Victoria's appellate court failed in August.\n\nOver two days in March, the full bench heard arguments from Pell's barrister Bret Walker SC and the director of the Office of Public Prosecutions, Kerri Judd.\n\nYou can read Melissa's piece below.\n\nToday, Cardinal George Pell will either walk free or remain in jail to serve the remainder of his six-year sentence for child sexual abuse.\n\nThe high court of Australia will at 10am deliver its decision in Pell's appeal against his conviction for sexually assaulting two 13-year-old choir boys in 1996.\n\nIn August, Victoria's court of appeal upheld his conviction by a majority of two to one. Pell has always maintained his innocence.\n\nThe decision will be delivered in open court in Brisbane. But due to Covid-19 and travel restrictions, it will be difficult for media to be present for the decision.\n\nThe judgment delivery will not be livestreamed, which means we may first learn the outcome when a summary is posted on the court's website.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_henriques_gomes@theguardian.com", "name": "Luke Henriques-Gomes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ben_smee@theguardian.com", "name": "Ben Smee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victoria (Australia)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria (Australia)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Pell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bret Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Choir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4a82c673a24eae55a174b88b555b67be830eb62/0_0_2660_1597/master/2660..jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&s=26e865db5ac08b98a8b5b3ad956d1b1f", "eventUri": "eng-5662498", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 11040}, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 11040, "relevance": 2}, {"uri": "6023000783", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-07", "time": "05:15:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-07T05:15:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-07T05:00:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-coronavirus-can-teach-us-about-hope-rebecca-solnit", "title": "'The impossible has already happened': what coronavirus can teach us about hope", "body": "Disasters begin suddenly and never really end. The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible - extending workers' rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US - have already happened.\n\nThe word \"crisis\" means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word \"emergency\" comes from \"emergence\" or \"emerge\", as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word \"catastrophe\" comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning.\n\nWe have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now - especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties - is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.\n\nA disaster (which originally meant \"ill-starred\", or \"under a bad star\") changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of \"we\" might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are.\n\nAs the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you're recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you're working all the time, especially when it appears you're doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world.\n\nThe first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems - political, economic, social, ecological - in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what's strong, what's weak, what's corrupt, what matters and what doesn't.\n\nI often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it's as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo - it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it's unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both.\n\nThose who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life - as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power - as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at suspending constitutional rights - and the rich seek more riches: two Republican senators are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing).\n\nDisaster scholars use the term \"elite panic\" to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe \"panic\" and \"looting\" in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it's wise to move rapidly from danger; sometimes it's altruistic to gather supplies to share.\n\nSuch elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a \"shoot to kill\" proclamation against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans's police and white vigilantes did the same thing: shooting black people in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided.\n\nThe mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers' levees had failed; the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush's administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition said of Brazil's rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: \"He represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn't care less about people's lives. They're worried about maintaining their profitability.\" (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.)\n\nThe billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed divine guidance in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now closed all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a memo sent to Wisconsin workers said: \"please do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms & your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.\" The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, said: \"The damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.\" (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.)\n\nHistorically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status.\n\nThe idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them - this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one's whims. \"This denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,\" wrote the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times.\n\nOur rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US - a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions.\n\nWhen a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future.\n\nFor many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: \"Let us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.\" We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant.\n\nMy friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: \"We are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.\"\n\nWhen we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables.\n\nAlthough staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff - medicine, medical equipment - made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all.\n\n\"Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers,\" Wordsworth wrote, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all - and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and basic income. In the aftermath of disaster, a change of consciousness and priorities are powerful forces.\n\nA dozen years ago I interviewed the Nicaraguan poet and Sandinista revolutionary Giocondo Belli for my book on disaster, A Paradise Built in Hell. What she told me about the aftermath of the 1972 earthquake in Managua - that, despite the dictatorship's crackdown, it helped bring on the revolution - was unforgettable. She said: \"You had a sense of what was important. And people realised that what was important was freedom and being able to decide your life and agency. Two days later you had this tyrant imposing a curfew, imposing martial law. The sense of oppression on top of the catastrophe was really unbearable. And once you had realised that your life can be decided by one night of the Earth deciding to shake, [you thought]: 'So what? I want to live a good life and I want to risk my life, because I can also lose my life in one night.' You realise that life has to be lived well or is not worth living. It's a very profound transformation that takes place during catastrophes.\"\n\nI have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good.\n\nI have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe's population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights. Lots of things we were assured were impossible - housing the homeless, for example - have come to pass in some places.\n\nIreland nationalised its hospitals, something \"we were told would never happen and could never happen,\" an Irish journalist commented. Canada came up with four months of basic income for those who lost their jobs. Germany did more than that. Portugal decided to treat immigrants and asylum seekers as full citizens during the pandemic. In the US, we have seen powerful labour agitation, and results. Workers at Whole Foods, Instacart and Amazon have protested at being forced to work in unsafe conditions during the pandemic. (Whole Foods has since offered workers who test positive two weeks off on full pay; Instacart says it has made changes to safeguard workers and shoppers, while Amazon said it is \"following guidelines\" on safety.) Some workers have gained new rights and raises, including almost half a million Kroger grocery store workers, while 15 state attorneys-general told Amazon to expand its paid sick leave. These specifics make clear how possible it is to change the financial arrangements of all our societies.\n\nBut often the most significant consequences of disasters are not immediate or direct. The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011's Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the individual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible.\n\nWe are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There's a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have plummeted. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco took over a new beach, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land.\n\nThere's another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it's a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells - for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It's a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid - full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change.\n\nBut this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often divide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be divided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one's own interior life and the suffering around us - and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed - well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory.\n\nSeven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: \"Provide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.\" It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless.\n\nHope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it. It is, I believe, what many of us are preparing to do.\n\n* Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_solnit@theguardian.com", "name": "Rebecca Solnit", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jair_Bolsonaro", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jair Bolsonaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Golisano", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Golisano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labor rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Global warming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Katrina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paychex", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paychex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_ice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drift ice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misnomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chimney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweatshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweatshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firebreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_Lobby", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hobby Lobby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Corps of Engineers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Critical thinking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calculus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

by everyone from the United Nations to Donald Trump that the US is a 'developed' economy. The statistics suggest otherwise\n\nWhen Susan Finley developed flu-like symptoms, she didn't go to the doctor because she was frightened about the cost. Finley's grandparents later found her dead in her apartment. She was 53.\n\nFinley did not die as a result of Covid-19. She died in 2016 as a result of America's healthcare system - a system that led her to avoid treatment for the common flu in order to avoid debt. It is that same system that is currently creaking under the pressure of a pandemic that experts warned was coming but governments failed to prepare for. It is a system that does not qualify for the term \"developed\".\n\nThe United States of America, we are told by everyone from the president to the United Nations, is a developed economy. That term, \"developed economy\", sounds like an endpoint, like man standing upright after a series of hunched and hairy iterations. It's the contrast that makes the definition - developed economies can only really exist if they are compared to their poorer \"developing\" counterparts. Covid-19 has merely shown the cracks in a very successful marketing campaign about which category the US falls into.\n\nThere are 2.9 hospital beds for every 1,000 people in the United States. That's fewer than Turkmenistan (7.4 beds per 1,000), Mongolia (7.0), Argentina (5.0) and Libya (3.7). In fact, the US ranks 69th out of 182 countries analyzed by the World Health Organization. This lack of hospital beds is forcing doctors across the country to ration care under Covid-19, pushing up the number of preventable deaths.\n\nAmerica's numbers are similarly unimpressive when it comes to medical doctors. The United States has 2.6 doctors per 1,000 people, placing it behind Trinidad & Tobago (2.7), and Russia (4.0 doctors per 1,000, for a country that is described as being \"in transition\"). Life expectancies at birth are lower in the US than they are in Chile or China. The US has a higher maternal mortality rate than Iran or Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt's not just health. Access to the internet is better in Bahrain and Brunei (two countries the UN does not consider developed economies) than it is in the US. Inequality scores are higher in America than they are in Mali and Yemen. A closer country to America in inequality is Israel, a country which functions as an apartheid state.\n\nAnd the US ranks 81st in the world in terms of women's political representation. So, you've got a better chance of making it into office as a woman if you live in Vietnam, or Albania. Sub-Saharan Africa is most comparable to America - 24% of seats in the region's parliaments are held by women, the same figure as in the US.\n\nIn the United States, 83% of students graduate high school. That figure is higher in Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Barbados, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Montenegro. None of those countries are considered \"developed economies\" by the United Nations.\n\nSo why does the United Nations consider the US as a developed economy when its own statistics so clearly suggest otherwise? One might argue that it's about simple wealth, or gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of the economy, per capita.\n\nBut if that were the measure of development then European countries such as Romania, Hungary and Slovakia should not qualify for the term \"developed economy\" while Bermuda, Qatar, Singapore and China should all make the list. Besides, GDP per capita is no reliable measure of wellbeing in a country like the US where the richest 5% of people own two-thirds of the national wealth.\n\nThe facts are as exhaustive as they are exhausting. There's one simple conclusion from all of this. We've been tricked. We've been told that America, like most other majority-white countries, deserves the title \"developed economy\". It does not. You can not charge a woman $39.95 to hold the baby that she has just given birth to. You can not constantly operate hospitals at close to capacity in order to maximize profits. The pursuit of private money in systems built for public good has not worked ethically or practically.\n\nWhy does it matter whether a country is defined as developing or not? Because it means that policymakers here can distract voters into thinking that crises are constantly diplomatic, military or trade based when actually the problems that America needs to fix most urgently are right here - they're the crises of health and education. Had those problems been better addressed, the nation would not be struggling as desperately as it is right now.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},
