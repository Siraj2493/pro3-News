Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some - such as the one that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, Mers - are far more severe.\n\nThe Japanese patient returned from Wuhan this month with a fever and was hospitalised. He was released yesterday after the symptoms subsided, the health ministry said.\n\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronaviruses.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

Passengers will be examined for symptoms of the pneumonia-like virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, with an additional 100 health workers deployed at the airports.\n\n\"Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation,\" said Martin Cetron, the head of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.\n\n\"On arrival to the United States, travellers from Wuhan may undergo health screening, including having their temperature taken and filling out a symptom questionnaire,\" CDC said on its website. Travellers with additional symptoms such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing will have an additional health assessment.\n\nAuthorities in Hong Kong have also stepped up detection measures, including temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers.\n\nThailand has been monitoring incoming passengers at four airports receiving daily flights from Wuhan, including Bangkok, Phuket, Don Mueang and Chiang Mai, since 3 January.

It suggests anyone with a respiratory illness should \"seek medical attention and share travel history with their health care provider\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco International Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

first time", "body": "WHO is working with Thai officials after woman who travelled from China is hospitalised with new strain of coronavirus\n\nHealth authorities have confirmed that a woman travelling from China to Thailand has been infected with a new strain of the coronavirus linked to a worrying outbreak in Wuhan.\n\nThe World Health Organisation said on Monday it was working with Thai officials after the case was identified and the woman hospitalised on 8 January, marking the first case the mystery illness has been detected outside China.\n\nThe WHO said in a statement: \"The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected, and reinforces why WHO calls for ongoing active monitoring and preparedness in other countries.\"\n\nA total of 41 people have been diagnosed with the pathogen, which appears to come from a new type of coronavirus, the Wuhan municipal health commission said in a statement at the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday one of those cases, a 61-year-old man, died from the pneumonia illness. Seven patients have been discharged and six remain in critical condition, according to the commission.\n\nResidents and observers are particularly wary of an outbreak in China after the Sars outbreak in 2002 and 2003, which spread to at least 37 countries and killed more than 800 people. Initial efforts by officials to cover up the epidemic is believed to have worsened its impact.\n\nChinese authorities have said that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Hundreds of contacts with patients, including health workers, have not contracted the virus.\n\nBut ahead of China's spring festival when China celebrates lunar new year and millions of people travel across the country to go home, authorities have cautioned residents to be on the lookout for symptoms such as fevers, difficulty breathing or body aches.\n\nCoronaviruses come from the same family of viruses that circulate among animals and have given rise to outbreaks such as Sara and Mers. Authorities believe it is linked to a seafood market in Wuhan that also sells wild animals.\n\nThe Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said the risk posed by the outbreak depends on \"whether and how well it spreads between people, the severity of resulting illness\", and medical and other countermeasures available to contain the virus.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lily_kuo@theguardian.com", "name": "Lily Kuo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transmission (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/392cba7928a78ab6d0b4e50ff76891d672d6ec83/0_678_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a03f0b4fd39fd22b8e0c938a73fcc550", "eventUri": "eng-5419948", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 69}, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 69, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1415049838", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-18", "time": "19:23:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-18T19:23:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-18T19:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/18/no-airport-screening-for-new-sars-like-virus-yet-china", "title": "No screening for new Sars-like virus at UK airports - yet", "body": "Experts decide no need for checks as member of Coronavirus family infects up to 1,700 in China\n\nHealth officials have ruled out introducing screening for passengers at UK airports, despite mounting fears over a deadly new virus from China. Three big US airports yesterday announced they would introduce screening.\n\nExperts warned that the outbreak of the Sars-like virus is likely to be on a larger scale than officially admitted. But Public Health England and the country's chief medical officer decided that such measures were not yet required in the UK.\n\nThe risk to the country is described as \"very low\", although officials stressed that they were monitoring events in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the disease has killed at least two and infected a further 45. However, scientists at the Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis in London believe the number of cases in Wuhan could be closer to 1,700.\n\nJeremy Farrar, an expert on emerging diseases, said: \"We are starting to hear of more cases in China and other countries, and it is likely that there will be many more.\"\n\nScientists say the virus is a member of the coronavirus family, six members of which are known to infect humans; this would be the seventh.\n\nMild coronaviruses cause the common cold, but more deadly strains can trigger severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 800 of the 8,000 people infected in an outbreak in 2002. Fears this virus could spread similarly have risen as China prepares to celebrate its new year, with hundreds of millions of people moving around the country and visiting family overseas. Farrar said: \"Wuhan is a major hub, and with travel a huge part of Chinese new year, the concern must remain high.\"\n\nNew York's JFK airport, and San Francisco and Los Angeles international airports have started to screen passengers arriving from Wuhan. Chinese authorities introduced exit-screening on flights leaving Wuhan, and authorities in Hong Kong are running temperature checks for travellers from the mainland.\n\nThailand - which has confirmed cases of the virus - announced that it was already screening passengers arriving in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket, and would soon introduce controls in the beach resort of Krabi. Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines have all stepped up screening as well.\n\nThe outbreak was still spreading, said Mike Turner of the Wellcome Trust, adding: \"We are more concerned than three days ago. One consequence of a more connected world is that outbreaks have the potential to spread internationally much more rapidly.\" But Farrar said that global measures to fight emerging diseases have improved significantly. \"The speed with which this virus has been identified, and the sharing of that information by China, has been amazing - a testament to the changes in public health in China since Sars, and the global coordination through the World Health Organisation. That has meant that the world is much better prepared to identify and treat patients.\"\n\nThe Foreign Office said it had updated its travel advice for the Wuhan region, but guidance on visiting China remains unchanged. Most people with the infection are believed to have contracted it at a market that sells seafood and meat in Wuhan. \"It is probable that we are looking at patients being affected over a number of days from multiple animal sources and with some degree of human-to-human transmission,\" said Farrar.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robin_mckie@theguardian.com", "name": "Robin McKie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "mark_townsend@theguardian.com", "name": "Mark Townsend", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Health England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wellcome Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

health official says there is 'no current need' to enhance airport screening", "body": "Australia's top health official says there is \"no current need\" to enhance existing airport screening measures to target an unknown Sars-like virus that has infected nearly 50 people in China and killed two since it was reported on New Year's Eve.\n\nAustralia's chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said authorities in Australia were \"watching developments very closely\" but had not issued a travel warning.\n\n\"There is no current need for any travel advisory in Australia, which is consistent with recommendations from the World Health Organisation,\" he said in a statement on Saturday evening.\n\nThe outbreak of the previously unknown coronavirus has been linked to a fish market at Wuhan, the capital of China's central Hubei province.\n\nThe Wuhan South China Seafood City market, which also sells chickens, bats, marmots and other animals, has been closed since 1 January.\n\nLaboratory tests performed in China found the virus was not Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome).\n\nMost of the cases were detected within days of the market being closed but Chinese authorities reported that four new patients had been diagnosed with viral pneumonia on Thursday.\n\nThree major airports in the United States have announced they will screen passengers arriving from Wuhan and screening has also been increased in airports in Thailand, which has reported two cases of the mystery virus, as well as airports in Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nA case has also been detected in Japan.\n\nOne of the cases in Thailand was detected by the thermal surveillance equipment at Bangkok airport.\n\nMurphy said the four new cases reported this week were \"of concern\".\n\n\"Whilst there is no clear evidence of human to human transmission, the identification of recent cases several days after the closure of the fish market, initially identified as the likely source, raises this as a possibility,\" he said.\n\n\"Importantly, however, there have been no cases of infection in the several hundred healthcare workers who have been exposed to the patients in China.\"\n\nMurphy said Australia already had mechanisms in place to screen for unwell travellers, including laws requiring that airlines report passengers who are showing signs of an infectious disease, such as fever, sweats, or chills. Planes that report unwell passengers are met on arrival and assessed by biosecurity officers.\n\nThe Australian Medical Association said it was also monitoring the situation.\n\n\"The AMA is in regular contact with the chief medical officer and we will obviously seek further briefings should the current level of advice change,\" the AMA president, Dr Tony Bartone, said.\n\nDoctors in Australia have been advised to ask anyone presenting with pneumonia-type symptoms if they have recently travelled to Wuhan.\n\nAlerts issued by the New South Wales and Victorian health departments urged doctors to \"consider novel coronavirus infection in patients with fever and respiratory symptoms and travel to Wuhan City, China in the 14 days before illness onset\".", "source": {"uri":

"We don't know enough yet to be sure of catching infectious carriers, says Wellcome Trust head\n\nMedical staff at airports trying to screen for carriers of the newly discovered coronavirus face a major problem. Its exact impact inside a human is still not known.\n\n\"At an airport, the thing you are screening for is temperature,\" said Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. \"A camera is used to identify if a person has a fever. If so, they may be infectious.\"\n\nBut in many conditions - such as influenza - a person often becomes infectious before their temperature starts to rise and they develop other symptoms. As a result, screening for such conditions at airports may miss infectious individuals and that means the technique has limited value.\n\n\"You use up a lot of resources for only marginal benefit,\" said Farrar. \"The point is that we do not know yet if a person who has been infected with this new virus will have a high temperature when they are at their most infectious and ready to pass on the virus. They may have. It is equally possible they may not have. We urgently need to know that information. The answer will tell us whether screening at airports has any value or not.\"\n\nOn the other hand, screening at airports is a highly visible sign that somebody is doing something about a disease outbreak, Farrar acknowledged. \"It can be reassuring. It suggests authorities are doing their best to contain an outbreak. So, to that extent, screening has some value. On balance, I think it is perfectly reasonable the UK has decided at this stage not to screen at airports.\"\n\nAs to the source of the new disease, Farrar said he thought bats would probably prove to be the final vector that brought the virus out of the animal kingdom to infect humans. \"Bats are sold in many markets across Asia as a delicacy and food, and they also have this ability to host viruses and not get sick. They are a remarkable source of viruses that can jump into humans, as we have seen with Sars, Ebola and Nipah fever in recent years. There are huge populations of them and they come into close proximity with humans.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robin_mckie@theguardian.com", "name": "Robin McKie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wellcome Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vector (epidemiology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henipavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ebola virus disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2786317d63891c738cdc698d9492a4ea04380bf7/0_182_5451_3271/master/5451.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=fa83b5e2724f203c402b74fc59913ed9", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 6}, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 6, "relevance": 52}], "totalResults": 8, "page": 1, "count": 8, "pages": 1}}
