U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.95, or 3.7%, to settle at $51.43 a barrel.\n\n\"The reports of the coronavirus spreading is raising more fears of demand destruction,\" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. \"When we saw the big move down in the stock market, oil traders were selling first and asking questions later.\"\n\nThe coronavirus has infected nearly 77,000 people and killed more than 2,500 in China, most of them in Hubei.\n\nSouth Korea's fourth-largest city, Daegu, was increasingly isolated as the number of infections there rose rapidly.\n\nEurope's biggest outbreak is in Italy, which reported a seventh death from the flu-like virus and 220 infections.\n\nKuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Iraq on Monday recorded their first new coronavirus cases, all involving people who had been in Iran, which raised its toll from the disease to 12 dead and 61 infected.\n\nAfghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey imposed travel and immigration curbs on Iran.\n\nStill, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that using the word \"pandemic\" did not fit the facts.\n\n\"We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,\" he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.\n\nSaudi Aramco expects the coronavirus impact on oil demand to be short-lived and for consumption to rise in the second half of the year, Chief Executive Amin Nasser told Reuters.\n\nOn Monday, local health officials in China said that four provinces had lowered their virus emergency response measures.\n\nGoldman Sachs said commodity prices could fall sharply before any rebound on the back of Chinese stimulus efforts.\n\n\"The promise of stimulus has made commodity markets act like equity markets, building up risks of a sharp correction,\" the bank said in a note.\n\nBank of America Global Research kept its 2020 forecast for the price of Brent crude steady at $62 a barrel, citing voluntary and involuntary declines in OPEC supply and the resilience of markets to geopolitical shocks.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to step up a sanctions campaign on Venezuela's oil sector and will be more aggressive in punishing people and companies that violate them, the top U.S. envoy to the Latin American country said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

had its worst daily percentage decline in about three weeks on Friday as a spike in new coronavirus cases and data showing a stall in U.S. business activity in February fueled investors' fears about economic growth.\n\nDeclines were led by the technology sector for a second straight session. Tech-related heavyweights Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) were the biggest drags on the S&P 500.\n\nThe S&P technology index .SPLRCT dropped 2.3%. Chipmakers, which have strong ties to China, also fell sharply. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX ended down 3%.\n\nChina reported a jump in new cases on Friday, while South Korea became the latest hot spot, with 100 new cases, and more than 80 people tested positive for the virus in Japan.\n\n\"It's creating a wild card\" for companies and investors, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. \"Going into a weekend not so long after the stock market was hitting highs, people are taking some money off the table.\"\n\nApple earlier this week issued a sales warning, citing the impact of the virus outbreak.\n\nThe worries pushed up Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index , and caused investors to seek safe-haven assets. The VIX hit its highest closing level since Feb. 3.\n\nGold and bond prices rose and some defensive equity sectors, including staples .SPLRCS, ended the day higher.\n\nThe IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' index of services sector activity dropped to its lowest level since October 2013, signaling a contraction for the first time since 2016. The manufacturing sector also clocked its lowest reading since August.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 227.57 points, or 0.78%, to 28,992.41, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 35.48 points, or 1.05%, to 3,337.75 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 174.38 points, or 1.79%, to 9,576.59.\n\nFor the week, the Dow was down 1.4% and the S&P 500 lost 1.3%. The Nasdaq shed 1.6%, its biggest weekly percentage decline in three weeks.\n\nHopes of monetary easing by major central banks had propelled the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to all-time highs earlier this week.\n\nAlso on Friday, Dropbox Inc (DBX.O) jumped 20% after it raised its outlook for operating margin, and Deere & Co (DE.N) rose 7% after an unexpected rise in first-quarter profit.\n\nSprint Corp (S.N) climbed 6% as it announced new merger terms with T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) showing a reduction in the stake of major Sprint shareholder SoftBank. T-Mobile shares dipped 0.9%.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.25-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 59 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 8.28 billion shares, compared with the 7.66 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index_future", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index future"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scrambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Time Zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_(psychology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mood (psychology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Kaplan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert D.

and the strong dollar got stronger on Thursday, rising to a three-year high against a basket of trading partner currencies, after a steep slide in the Japanese yen called into question its safe-haven status.\n\nGold prices hit their highest in seven years as investors sought safe-haven assets after a rise in the number of new coronavirus cases in South Korea. Oil prices rose, supported by China's efforts to bolster its virus-weakened economy.\n\nThe dollar has surged almost 2% since Tuesday against the yen, reaching its highest in almost 10 months, and the greenback climbed to near three-year highs against the euro.\n\nThe dollar index of the world's most-traded currencies was up 0.17% to its highest level since April 2017.\n\nThe index is up 3.6% this year. It also gained to its best levels of the year against China's offshore yuan.\n\nA host of reasons were cited for the dollar's move, ranging from the outperformance of the U.S. economy and corporate earnings to potential recessions in Japan and the euro zone.\n\nA run of dire economic news out of Japan has stirred talk the country is already in recession and that Japanese funds were dumping local assets in favor of U.S. shares and gold.\n\n\"The strongest explanation (for the yen's decline) is a widespread selling by Japanese asset managers amid growing fears about the health of Japan's economy,\" said Raffi Boyadijian, investment analyst at XM.\n\nThe yen's slide is unusual because the exchange rate with the dollar has been shedding its close correlation to the price of gold and U.S. Treasury yields, a development to be watched, he said.\n\n\"This raises question marks about whether the yen is losing some of its shine as the world's preferred safe-haven currency,\" Boyadijian said.\n\nInvestors are looking to buy U.S. assets and those stories that would be relatively unaffected by the cyclical environment, said Jason Draho, head of Americas asset allocation at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nChina reported a drop in new virus cases and announced an interest rate cut to buttress its economy. But South Korea recorded an increase in new cases, Japan reported two deaths and researchers said the pathogen seemed to spread more easily than previously believed.\n\nA rally that had lifted major U.S. and European stock indexes to record highs this week lost steam, as investors fretted about the spread of the coronavirus outside of China.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.68% and emerging market stocks lost 0.90%.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.86%. Paris' main index fell 0.8% as luxury stocks, which derive a chunk of their demand from Chinese customers, fell after the number of coronavirus cases outside China spiked.\n\nLVMH, Kering and spirits maker Pernod Ricard slid between 2.2% and 3.5%.\n\nAnalysts cited a Global Times report that said a central Beijing hospital recorded 36 new cases among hospital staff and patients' families, causing U.S. stocks to drop further on fear infections could be rising rapidly in the capital.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 181.47 points, or 0.62%, to 29,166.56, the S&P 500 lost 20.03 points, or 0.59%, to 3,366.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 91.57 points, or 0.93%, to 9,725.61.9,725.61\n\nE*Trade jumped 22.1% after Morgan Stanley offered to buy it in a $13 billion stock deal, the biggest acquisition by a Wall Street bank since the financial crisis.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.5% overnight, led by drops in Hong Kong's Hang Seng and South Korea's KOSPI.\n\nU.S. gold futures settled up 0.5% at $1,620.50 an ounce.\n\nSpot gold rose 0.3% to $1,616.74 an ounce, after hitting its highest since February 2013 at $1,622.19.\n\nOil prices rose further after a U.S. report showed a draw in gasoline inventories and a much smaller-than-anticipated rise in crude stocks. U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell 2 million barrels in the week to Feb. 14. Analysts had estimated an increase of 400,000 barrels. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed that crude inventories rose only 414,000 barrels last week, compared with a 2.5 million-barrel rise that analysts had expected in a Reuters poll.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 19 cents to settle at $59.31 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate gained 49 cents to settle at $53.78 a barrel.\n\nDemand for safe-haven U.S. Treasury debt was robust, driving the 30-year bond yield below the psychologically significant 2% level to its lowest since September 2019.\n\nThe 30-year bond last rose 36/32 in price to push its yield down to 1.9661%.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes last rose 15/32 in price to yield 1.5203%.\n\nLonger-dated euro zone government bonds led a broad rally as concerns about an economic slowdown in the region and virus-related damage to Asian growth boosted demand for government debt.\n\nThe 10-year German government bond yield slid 3 basis points to -0.44%, close to 3-1/2-month lows reached earlier in February.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

eases, led by tech decline on mounting fears coronavirus...", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday, led by declines in technology heavyweights, after reports of new coronavirus cases in China and other countries intensified fears over its spread and impact on the global economy.\n\nInvestors were unnerved by a sharp late-morning drop that took the S&P 500 briefly down more than 1% on the day, with some traders attributing the move to a Global Times report that a central Beijing hospital had reported 36 new cases. This raised worries about a potential increase in infections in the Chinese capital.\n\nInvestors were already skittish after Japan reported two new deaths and South Korea reported a rise in new infections. Research suggested the virus was spreading more quickly than previously thought.\n\n\"The overlying question is the uncertainty over the coronavirus and whether it's going to spread further and impact global economic activity before things stabilize and ultimately get better,\" said Michael Sheldon, executive director and CIO at RDM Financial Group at Hightower in Westport, Connecticut.\n\nHe said it appeared investors were taking profits in some high-flying technology names and buying shares of other groups, including small caps. The Russell 2000 index ended up 0.2% on the day.\n\nThe S&P 500 technology index lost 1% on the day. The index has led gains in the S&P 500 so far this year and is still up more than 10% since Dec. 31. Shares of Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc fell and were among the biggest drag on the S&P 500 on Thursday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 128.05 points, or 0.44%, to 29,219.98, the S&P 500 lost 12.92 points, or 0.38%, to 3,373.23 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 66.22 points, or 0.67%, to 9,750.97.\n\nRecent policy easing by China, a largely better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings season and hopes that the economic jolt from the coronavirus will be short-lived have pushed Wall Street's main indexes to new highs in recent weeks.\n\n\"In my opinion, what is happening is the market got well ahead of itself. The coronavirus thing is not over by any stretch,\" said Ken Polcari, senior market strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in Jupiter, Florida.\n\nE*Trade jumped 21.8% after Morgan Stanley offered to buy it in a $13 billion stock deal, the biggest acquisition by a Wall Street bank since the financial crisis.\n\nIn other corporate news, ViacomCBS Inc slumped 17.9% as its earnings fell short of revenue and profit expectations in its first quarterly earnings results since closing its merger.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 138 new highs and 56

investors into safe havens, with gold hitting a fresh seven-year high and the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond sliding to an all-time low.\n\nThe virus spread to hundreds of people in Chinese prisons, contributing to a jump in reported cases beyond the epicenter in Hubei province, including 100 more in South Korea.\n\nCases of the disease have turned up in 26 countries and territories outside mainland China, killing 11 people, according to a Reuters tally. According to data, mainland China had 892 new confirmed cases and 118 deaths, with most of those in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, which remains under virtual lockdown.\n\nThe CBOE market volatility index, the market's \"fear gauge,\" rose just shy of 10% in the biggest single-day jump since late January. The VIX closed at its highest level since Feb. 3.\n\nCrude oil prices slid about 1% and the U.S. dollar fell across the board.\n\nHeading into the weekend, investors decided to book profits on the possibility of more coronavirus news, said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.\n\nThe coronavirus has become this year's worry, much as the U.S.-China trade war was in 2019, he said.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.75% and emerging market stocks lost 1.05%.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.49% as shares fell from record highs on Thursday. A raft of disappointing earnings added to fears about the global impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAuto stocks led losses in Europe, down 1.9% in their worst session in four weeks. The sector is the worst performing among major regional sectors, off more than 8% so far this year.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 227.57 points, or 0.78%, to 28,992.41. The S&P 500 lost 35.48 points, or 1.05%, to 3,337.75 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 174.38 points, or 1.79%, to 9,576.59.\n\nU.S. stocks were beaten down by concerns about the virus and after data showed American business activity stalled in February, signaling a contraction for the first time since 2016.\n\nU.S. chipmakers fell sharply.

hitting a fresh seven-year high and the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond sliding to an all-time low.\n\nThe virus spread to hundreds of people in Chinese prisons, contributing to a jump in reported cases beyond the epicenter in Hubei province, including 100 more in South Korea.\n\nCases of the disease have turned up in 26 countries and territories outside mainland China, killing 11 people, according to a Reuters tally. According to data, mainland China had 892 new confirmed cases and 118 deaths, with most of those in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, which remains under virtual lockdown.\n\nThe CBOE market volatility index , the market's \"fear gauge,\" rose just shy of 10% in the biggest single-day jump since late January. The VIX closed at its highest level since Feb. 3.\n\nCrude oil prices slid about 1% and the U.S. dollar fell across the board.\n\nHeading into the weekend, investors decided to book profits on the possibility of more coronavirus news, said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.\n\nThe coronavirus has become this year's worry, much as the U.S.-China trade war was in 2019, he said.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.75% and emerging market stocks .MSCIEF lost 1.05%.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.49% as shares fell from record highs on Thursday. A raft of disappointing earnings added to fears about the global impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAuto stocks .SXAP led losses in Europe, down 1.9% in their worst session in four weeks. The sector is the worst performing among major regional sectors, off more than 8% so far this year.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 227.57 points, or 0.78%, to 28,992.41. The S&P 500 .SPX lost 35.48 points, or 1.05%, to 3,337.75 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 174.38 points, or 1.79%, to 9,576.59.\n\nU.S. stocks were beaten down by concerns about the virus and after data showed American business activity stalled in February, signaling a contraction for the first time since 2016.\n\nU.S. chipmakers fell sharply. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX slid 2.99%, on track for its worst one-day drop since Jan 31, when fears about the health crisis pummeled markets.\n\nA flash reading of the IHS Markit services sector Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to its lowest level since October 2013.

slowing virus, dollar gains", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained while U.S. and European equity indexes scaled fresh peaks on Wednesday after China reported another decline in new coronavirus cases and on expectations of Chinese stimulus to counter a slowdown in growth.\n\nBig manufacturing hubs on the Chinese coast are loosening curbs on the movement of people and traffic while local governments prod factories to restart production, a sign of reviving economic activity investors are watching closely.\n\nChina is widely expected to cut its benchmark lending rate on Thursday, according to a survey of traders and analysts, after the country's central bank lowered the interest rate on medium-term loans earlier this week.\n\nThe death toll from the coronavirus climbed above 2,000, but the number of newly reported cases fell for a second day to the lowest since January, news that lifted Asian shares and spurred U.S. and European stocks to new highs.\n\n\"The coronavirus is the top headline these days and the growth in new cases, evidently, has slowed,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel.\n\n\"Perhaps we've seen the worst of it, at least in terms of the growth rate of new cases,\" he said.\n\nA couple of auto companies evidently restarted production in China, which is another good sign for the economy as it means workers are heading back to factories, Ghriskey said.\n\nA index of equity performance across the globe, the main indexes on Wall Street and two pan-regional indexes in Europe all climbed to new highs, as did the key index in Canada.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.48% while its emerging market index rose 0.69%.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.76%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 138.99 points, or 0.48%, to 29,371.18, the S&P 500 gained 19.34 points, or 0.57%, to 3,389.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 90.99 points, or 0.93%, to 9,823.73.\n\nOvernight, MSCI's index of Asian shares outside Japan rose 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei benchmark gained almost 1%, helped by the retreat of the Japanese yen.\n\nThe dollar climbed to near a three-year high against a basket of other currencies and the safe-haven yen sank to a nine-month low on news of an apparent decline in the infection rate for the coronavirus and strong U.S. data.\n\nU.S. homebuilding fell less than expected in January while permits surged to a near 13-year high, pointing to sustained housing market strength that could help keep the longest economic expansion in American history on track.\n\nThe dollar index rose 0.21%, with the euro up 0.02% to $1.0793.\n\nThe yen weakened 1.20% versus the greenback at 111.22 per dollar.\n\nThe price of Brent crude rose for a seventh consecutive day after demand worries eased with a slowing of new coronavirus cases in China and supply was curtailed by a U.S. move to cut more Venezuelan crude from the market.\n\nBrent rose $1.41 to $59.16 a barrel. The global benchmark is up nearly 10% since falling last week to its lowest this year. U.S. oil gained $1.08 to $53.13 a barrel.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields edged higher as expectations China will take more steps to bolster its economy boosted risk taking, and after U.S. economic data beat economists' expectations.\n\nEdward Park, chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald, cited President Xi Jinping's latest commitment to meeting 2020 growth targets.\n\n\"This in itself implies there will be more fiscal and monetary stimulus,\" Park said. \"That's the real carrot for markets today.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [],

alert\" on Sunday after a surge in coronavirus infections and two more deaths, while China state media warned the outbreak there had yet to reach a turning point despite some signs of easing.\n\n* China has reported a total of 76,936 cases of the disease caused by the virus, known as COVID-19, including 2,442 deaths.\n\n* Mainland China had 648 new confirmed cases on Saturday, up from 397 a day earlier. The death toll was up by 97 from the previous day. The virus epicenter of Hubei province reported 96 new deaths, of which 82 were in the provincial capital Wuhan.\n\n* South Korea raised its infectious disease alert to its highest level on Sunday as confirmed coronavirus cases in the country jumped to 602 and the death toll rose to five.\n\n* Italy's northern Lombardy region reported 89 cases on Sunday, from 54 a day earlier, bringing the total number of cases in the country to more than 100. Veneto, the other worst hit area, said it had 19 cases, up seven from Saturday. Two people have died. Authorities have banned public events and told workers in affected areas to stay home.\n\n* Iran confirmed 15 new cases of the new coronavirus, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on Sunday, taking the total to 43 with a death toll of eight.\n\n* France said it currently had one patient with the virus but new cases were very likely and it was particularly watchful of the situation in Italy.\n\n* Japan's health minister has apologized after a woman who was allowed to leave a coronavirus-infected cruise ship docked near Tokyo tested positive for the virus. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe instructed government agencies on Sunday to draft a comprehensive plan to curb the spread of the virus, after it reported 27 more cases a day earlier.\n\n* The World Athletics Indoor Championships, scheduled for Nanjing from March 13-15, were postponed until next year. Soccer matches in northern Italy and China were among other sporting events postponed.\n\n* The World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link, although the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, its director general said on Saturday.\n\n* Outside China, there have been more than 1,200 cases in 26 countries, the WHO said. That includes one confirmed case on the African continent, in Egypt.\n\n* The International Monetary Fund predicted on Saturday the outbreak would lower China's growth this year to 5.6% and shave 0.1 percentage points from global growth.\n\n* Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Saturday the yen's recent declines were largely driven by a strong dollar, shrugging off some market views that the virus epidemic is triggering an outflow of funds from Asia.\n\n* Japan's factory activity suffered its steepest contraction in seven years in February, reinforcing the risk of a recession in the world's third-largest economy.\n\n* Two elderly passengers from aboard a cruise ship moored near Tokyo died, as hundreds more disembarked after two weeks in quarantine.\n\n* Two Australians evacuated from the cruise ship have tested positive after returning to their home country, whose prime minister plans to extend a ban on arrivals from mainland China into a fourth week.\n\n* Tokyo Metropolitan Government said it would either cancel or postpone major indoor events it has sponsored for the next three weeks.\n\n* China's banking sector may face a surge of non-performing loans in 2020 if the virus doesn't peak until April.\n\n* Beijing's containment measures look set to delay the rollout of 5G as tenders for six big projects have been postponed since Jan.31.\n\n* Asian shares were under water on Friday as coronavirus fears sent funds fleeing into the safety of U.S. assets, lifting the dollar to three-year highs.

virus warning, euro near three-year low", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled and global equity markets slid on Tuesday after Apple Inc said it was unlikely to meet its sales guidance because of the coronavirus outbreak in China, a warning highlighting the epidemic's threat to global growth and corporate profits.\n\nChina reported its fewest new coronavirus infections since January and its lowest daily death toll in a week, but the World Health Organization said data suggesting the epidemic had slowed should be viewed with caution.\n\nApple said on Monday that manufacturing facilities in China that produce its iPhone and other electronics had begun to reopen, but were ramping up more slowly than expected.\n\nThe disruption in China will result in fewer iPhones available for sale around the world, making Apple one of the largest Western firms to be hurt by the outbreak.\n\nGold climbed more than 1% to a two-week high as investors sought safety in the wake of Apple's warning and the price of Brent, the global crude benchmark, fell below $57 a barrel.\n\nForecasters, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), have cut 2020 oil demand estimates because of the virus.\n\nEquity markets around the world fell, with MSCI's all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS slipping 0.72%.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.38% and emerging market stocks lost 1.28%.\n\nHSBC Holdings PLC's (HSBA.L) announcement that it would shed $100 billion in assets, shrink its investment bank and revamp its U.S. and European businesses in a drastic overhaul added to concerns about the impact of the coronavirus.\n\nThe UK-based bank, whose huge Asian operations are headquartered in Hong Kong, said the coronavirus epidemic had significantly impacted staff and customers. HSBC shares fell 6.35%, leading the FTSE 100 index .FTSE to close down 0.69%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 252.29 points, or 0.86%, to 29,145.79, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 21.49 points, or 0.64%, to 3,358.67 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 45.93 points, or 0.47%, to 9,685.25.\n\n\"We're seeing some renewed weakness in the stock markets following the announcement by Apple,\" said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen. \"It's having a global impact on supply chains and shipments - this will have a negative impact on growth expectations.\"\n\nOvernight in Asia, China's CSI300 blue chip stocks index .CSI300 lost 0.5% after gaining sharply on Monday, encouraged by a central bank rate cut and government stimulus hopes.[.T][.SS]\n\nJapan's Nikkei .N225 lost 1.40%.\n\nThe dollar rose to nearly a three-week high against the euro after Germany's ZEW survey of economic sentiment showed slumping investor confidence in Europe's largest economy.\n\nThe euro EUR= was down 0.2% to $1.0812, while the dollar index .DXY rose 0.3%. The Japanese yen JPY= strengthened 0.03% versus the greenback at 109.85 per dollar.\n\nThe ZEW research institute said in its monthly survey that investors' mood deteriorated far more than expected in February on worries the coronavirus would crimp world trade.\n\nThe survey added to expectations the German economy will lose more momentum in the first half as slumping exports keep manufacturers mired in a recession.\n\nSafe-haven German 10-year bond DE10YT=RR yields fell to -0.43% at one point. Other 10-year bond yields in Europe NL10YT=RR FR10YT=RR fell similarly.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields also fell. The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR rose 12/32 in price, pushing its yield down to 1.5474%.\n\nThe slide in oil prices was pressured by concerns over the impact on crude demand from the coronavirus outbreak in China and a lack of further action by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies to support the market.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 fell 74 cents to $56.93 a barrel after rallying in the previous five sessions. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 fell 53 cents to $51.52 a barrel.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

possible' - govt spokesman\n\n* Total infection cases at 520, most from cruise liner\n\n* U.S., other countries evacuating nationals from Diamond Princess (Adds theft of masks; paragraph 9)\n\nBy Sakura Murakami and Ju-min Park\n\nTOKYO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Japan plans to trial HIV medications to treat patients infected with coronavirus as its growing number of cases poses an increasing threat to the economy and public health, the government's top spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nThe government was making \"preparations so that clinical trials using HIV medication on the novel coronavirus can start as soon as possible,\" Yoshihide Suga told a briefing, but added he could not say how long a new drug would take to be approved.\n\nJapan had 520 confirmed infections by Monday, including 454 cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the port of Yokohama, the health ministry said, with one death from the virus.\n\nOn Tuesday, there was three more cases confirmed with the virus in Wakayama Prefecture, local media reported.\n\nAs the contracting economy fuels a risk of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on the size of public gatherings while some companies are telling employees to work from home.\n\nThe HIV trials come as those drugs have been touted as a potential cure for the coronavirus around the world. With no therapy yet proven 100% effective, the epidemic has killed close to 1,900 people in mainland China.\n\nPeople in China have begun exploring unorthodox ways to get treated, with some appealing to HIV patients and unauthorised importers for medicine.\n\nIn Thailand, doctors said they appeared to have had some success in treating severe cases of the virus with a combination of medications for flu and HIV.\n\nAs demand for masks skyrockets, police are investigating a theft of 6,000 surgical masks reported by the Kobe Red Cross Hospital in the central Japanese city, a hospital official told Reuters.\n\nJapanese officials have vowed to work hard to avoid disruptions to the Olympic Games, which start in Tokyo in July. But growing concern over the virus spurred Mongolia's Olympics archery team to cancel training in Japan, the Kyodo news agency said.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. government evacuation flights flew home more than 300 Americans who had been on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\n\nWith more than 3,000 passengers and crew, the ship has been in quarantine since early this month, after a passenger who had left it in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus.\n\nAbout half of those aboard are Japanese and the rest foreign nationals, many of whom have expressed frustration over the quarantine.\n\nThe liner will receive meals from World Central Kitchen, a non-profit set up by celebrity chef Jose Andres, in a bid to reduce the burden on crew, said Rai Caluori, vice president of vessel operator Princess Cruises.\n\nForeign governments including Australia, Canada, Italy and South Korea also plan to take citizens off the cruise liner.\n\nA plane chartered by the Canadian government has left for Japan to evacuate its nationals, TV Asahi said. Canada has said 14 days of quarantine await them on their return.\n\nSouth Korea is also sending a government charter flight on Tuesday to take home four citizens, and a Japanese spouse, who have no symptoms, a South Korean official said.\n\nJapanese who test negative will begin disembarking as early as Wednesday, health minister Katsunobu Kato said.\n\n\"Everyone wants to return home as soon as possible, so considering that feeling, we are making preparations,\" Kato told reporters.\n\nDisembarkation was set for Feb. 19 to 21, Japan's vice health minister said, according to a copy of a letter circulated on Twitter by a passenger using the handle @daxa-tw.\n\nThe letter told passengers that Yokohama health authorities would take their temperatures before they left the ship.\n\nJapan's health ministry could not immediately be reached for confirmation.

"Coronavirus spreads in China prisons, Korean church as fears weigh...", "body": "BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in Chinese prisons, authorities said, as cases climbed outside the epicenter in Hubei province, including 100 more in South Korea and a worsening outbreak in Italy where officials announced the country's first death.\n\nA total of 234 infections among Chinese prisoners outside Hubei ended 16 straight days of declines in new mainland cases. Another 271 cases were reported in prisons in Hubei - where the virus first emerged in December in its now locked-down capital, Wuhan.\n\nU.S. stocks sold off and the Nasdaq had its worst daily percentage decline in about three weeks on Friday as the spike in new coronavirus cases and data showing a stall in U.S. business activity in February fueled investors' fears about economic growth. The rise in coronavirus cases sent investors scrambling for safe havens such as gold and government bonds.\n\nChinese state television quoted Communist Party rulers as saying the outbreak had not yet peaked amid a jump in cases in a hospital in Beijing. Online site for coronavirus news - here Graphic: Tracking the novel coronavirus - here Reuters graphics on the new coronavirus - here\n\nTotal cases of the new coronavirus in the Chinese capital neared 400 with four deaths.\n\nChina has reported a total of 75,567 cases of the virus to the World Health Organization (WHO) including 2,239 deaths. In the past 24 hours, China reported 892 new confirmed cases and 118 deaths.\n\nU.S. activity in the manufacturing and services sectors stalled over growing concern of the potential toll of the virus, a survey of purchasing managers showed on Friday.\n\nThe IHS Markit flash services sector Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to its lowest since October 2013, signaling that a sector accounting for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy was in contraction for the first time since 2016.\n\nData also showed Japan's factory activity suffered its steepest contraction in seven years in February, underlining the risk of a recession there as the impact of the outbreak spreads. Asian and European stocks also fell. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\nThe impact of the outbreak on global growth \"may be large\" given China's role in the world economy, and may stress financial markets just as tensions over a U.S.-China trade war did in 2019, Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro said on Friday.\n\nThe outbreak may curb demand for oil in China and other Asian countries, depressing prices to as low as $57 a barrel and clouding growth prospects across the Middle East, the Institute of International Finance said.\n\nThe WHO warned that the window of opportunity to contain the international spread of the epidemic was closing after cases were reported in Iran and Lebanon.\n\nAn outbreak of coronavirus in northern Italy worsened on Friday as officials announced and 78-year-old man was the first Italian to die after being infected. The man was among 17 confirmed cases, including the country's first known cases of local transmission.\n\nThe virus has emerged in 26 countries and territories outside mainland China, killing 11 people, according to a Reuters tally.\n\n\"There still is a chance we can focus principally on containment, but it's getting harder because we're getting secondary chains of transmission in other countries now,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a U.S. infectious disease expert from Vanderbilt University.\n\nThe spike in cases in jails in the northern province of Shandong and Zhejiang in the east made up most of the 258 newly confirmed Chinese infections outside Hubei province on Friday.\n\nAuthorities said officials deemed responsible for the outbreaks had been fired and the government had sent a team to investigate the Shandong outbreak, media reported.\n\nHubei, adding to case-reporting confusion, doubled the number of new cases it initially reported on Wednesday to 775 from 349. The lower number was a result of going back to counting only cases confirmed with genetic tests, rather than including those detected by chest scans.\n\nSouth Korea is the latest hot spot with 100 new cases doubling its total to 204, most in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million, where scores were infected in what authorities called a \"super-spreading event\" at a church, traced to an infected 61-year-old woman who attended services.\n\nSouth Korean officials designated Daegu and neighboring Cheongdo county as special care zones where additional medical staff and isolation facilities will be deployed. Malls, restaurants and streets in the city were largely empty with the mayor calling the outbreak an \"unprecedented crisis\".\n\nAnother center of infection has been the Diamond Princess cruise ship held under quarantine in Japan since Feb. 3, with more than 630 cases accounting for the biggest infection cluster outside China. Australia said on Saturday that four more of its nationals evacuated from the cruise ship tested positive for coronavirus in addition to two individuals previously identified.\n\nSome 35 British passengers were due to arrive back home on Saturday after spending more than two weeks stuck on the quarantined.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday that of 329 Americans evacuated from the ship, 18 have tested positive for the virus.\n\nA second group of Chinese citizens from Hong Kong who had been aboard the Diamond Princess have been flown home from Japan, Xinhua News reported.\n\nIn the Iranian city of Qom, state TV showed voters in the parliamentary election wearing surgical masks after the country confirmed 13 new cases, including two deaths. Health officials on Thursday called for all religious gatherings the holy city of Qom to be suspended.\n\nUkraine's health minister joined evacuees from China for two weeks' quarantine in a sanatorium on Friday in a show of solidarity after fears over the possible spread of coronavirus led to clashes between protesters and police.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose to record closing highs on Wednesday as optimism that China would take more measures to prop up its economy eased concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nStocks held gains following the release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meeting, which showed policymakers were cautiously optimistic about their ability to hold interest rates steady this year while acknowledging new risks caused by the virus outbreak.\n\nThe number of new coronavirus cases dropped for a second straight day in China.\n\nChina is widely expected to cut its benchmark lending interest rate on Thursday, which would add to measures aimed at limiting the impact from business shutdowns and travel curbs on the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"It sounds as though investors are breathing a sigh of relief that they believe the worst of the coronavirus is behind us,\" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago.\n\n\"Investors are feeling emboldened because central banks have got their back,\" he added.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) rose 1.4%, recouping most of the losses in the previous session after a surprise sales warning that highlighted concerns about the coronavirus' impact on global supply chains.\n\nThe S&P 500 technology sector .SPLRCT also rose, ending up 1.1%. Among sectors, it was the second-biggest percentage gainer after energy .SPNY, which rose 1.3%.\n\nOil prices overall gained 2% on the back of slowing coronavirus cases.\n\n\"There seemed to be a number of high-profile companies that were talking about coronavirus and the potential for it to impact earnings. Today, investors are perhaps looking at markets with more thoughtfulness, recognizing (there's) policy support and some good news coming from the infection rates,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 115.84 points, or 0.4%, to 29,348.03, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 15.86 points, or 0.47%, to 3,386.15 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 84.44 points, or 0.87%, to 9,817.18.\n\nAlso helping the technology sector was a 6.1% gain in chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) after Bernstein raised its shares to \"outperform.\"\n\nAmong other stocks, Garmin Ltd (GRMN.O) jumped 6.7% after the wearable fitness device maker forecast full-year revenue above analysts' estimates.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 77 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 169 new highs and 57 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 7.22 billion shares, compared to the 7.57 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

Korea's fourth-largest city were abandoned on Thursday, with residents holed up indoors after dozens of people caught the new coronavirus in what authorities described as a \"super-spreading event\" at a church.\n\nThe deserted shopping malls and cinemas of Daegu, a city of 2.5 million people, became one of the most striking images outside China of an outbreak that international authorities are trying stop from becoming a global pandemic.\n\nNew research suggesting the virus is more contagious than previously thought added to the alarm.\n\nIn China, where the virus has killed more than 2,100 people and infected nearly 75,000, officials changed their methodology for reporting infections, creating new doubt about data they have cited as evidence their containment strategy is working.\n\nU.S. stocks fell on Thursday and gold prices hit their highest in seven years as investors sought safe havens over worries about the coronavirus' economic impact. [MKTS/GLOB] U.S. manufacturers are scrambling for alternative sources as supply chains in China, the workshop of the world, dry up.\n\n\"If you look at today's chain of supply, if China suffers, everyone in the world will suffer as well,\" China's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Chen Xu, told reporters. Online site for coronavirus news - here\n\nIn South Korea, Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin told residents to stay indoors after 90 people who worshipped at one church showed symptoms and dozens of new cases were confirmed.\n\nThe church had been attended by a 61-year-old woman who tested positive, known as \"Patient 31.\" South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described the outbreak there as a \"super-spreading event.\"\n\n\"We are in an unprecedented crisis,\" Kwon told reporters, adding that all members of the church would be tested. \"We've asked them to stay at home isolated from their families.\"\n\nDescribing the abandoned streets, resident Kim Geun-woo, 28, told Reuters by telephone: \"It's like someone dropped a bomb in the middle of the city. It looks like a zombie apocalypse.\"\n\nSouth Korea now has 104 confirmed cases of the flu-like virus, and reported its first death.\n\nIn China, officials have been pointing to evidence that new cases are declining as proof they are succeeding in keeping the virus largely contained to Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan, where the virus initially emerged.\n\n\"We are encouraged by this trend but this is no time for complacency,\" World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing in Geneva.\n\nSome 25 other countries have reported 1,076 cases to the WHO, including five in Iran, the latest affected, he said. As a result, Kuwait Airways has suspended flights to Iran.\n\nIranian health officials urged all religious gatherings to be suspended in Qom, news agency ISNA said on Thursday, after two more people tested positive for the coronavirus in the holy city, where two died of it this week.\n\nGraphic: Tracking the novel coronavirus - here\n\nJapan reported the deaths of two elderly passengers from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship on Thursday, the first fatalities from aboard the ship where more than 630 cases account for the biggest cluster of infection outside China.\n\nJapan, due to host the Olympics in July, began allowing passengers who test negative to leave and hundreds disembarked on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nChina's Global Times newspaper reported 36 new cases at one Beijing hospital as of Thursday, a sharp increase from nine cases two weeks earlier. It said this had led \"many to fear a potential explosion of infection numbers in the capital.\"\n\nChina has imposed severe controls in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, to halt the spread of the virus, and has taken urgent steps to keep the overall economy from crashing.\n\nOn Thursday, its central bank cut a borrowing rate, while the authorities extended an order for businesses in Wuhan to shut down until March 11. Schools in the city, which had been due to re-open on Friday, will also stay shut.\n\n\"The economic and social impact of course is obvious, to what extent I cannot pre-judge. It is safe to say the cost will be very much,\" said China's U.N. ambassador Chen, adding that masks, protective gear and respiratory machines are needed.\n\nRevisions to China's methodology for confirming cases have raised doubts about its data. Under the latest methodology, which excludes cases identified by chest X-rays, China reported fewer than 400 new cases over the past day, less than a quarter of the number it had been finding in recent days under the previous broader method.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

were buoyant on Monday as the promise of further policy stimulus from China to counteract the economic hit from a coronavirus outbreak calmed nervous investors.\n\nTrading was light, with U.S. stocks and bond markets shut for a public holiday.\n\nBoth the pan-European STOXX 600 index and Germany's DAX reached record highs before paring some gains. [.EU] The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was flat on the day.\n\nIn Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.14% to near last week's peak of 558.30, its highest since late January.\n\nThe gains were led by China, whose blue-chip index climbed 2.25% after the country's central bank lowered a key interest rate and injected more liquidity into the system.\n\nAlso whetting risk appetite was an announcement by China's finance minister on Sunday that Beijing would roll out tax and fee cuts.\n\n\"Traders are mindful of the fact the Chinese authorities intervened in the financial markets at the beginning of the month, when the domestic stock markets reopened after the Lunar New Year celebrations,\" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets in London.\n\n\"Some dealers hold the view that Beijing will intervene in the markets again should the situation get much worse, which could explain the resilience of equity markets.\"\n\nFears about the jolt to the world economy from the coronavirus lingered, though, as the number of reported new cases in China rose to 2,048 as on Sunday from 2,009 the previous day.\n\n\"The latest numbers from the Hubei province still suggest that the infection pace is slowing after the sudden jump following the methodology changes last week,\" Danske Bank said in a research note, highlighting that the number of new cases within China is the lowest since Jan. 23.\n\nRestrictions were tightened further in Hubei over the weekend. Most vehicles were banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice.\n\nJapan's Nikkei fell 0.7% after its economy shrank at the fastest pace in almost six years in the December quarter. The slowdown in the world's third-largest economy came amid concern the coronavirus effects will hurt output and tourism, stoking fears Japan may slump into recession.\n\nThe coronavirus also led trade-dependent Singapore to downgrade its 2020 economic growth forecast. China's economy is widely expected to slow sharply as well.\n\nSouth Korea's KOSPI index ended mostly flat. Australian, Singapore and Malaysian share indexes weakened.\n\nAsia's woes have yet to spread to the United States, though. Wall Street indexes scaled record highs on Friday. [.N]\n\nTalk of a middle class tax cut and a proposal to encourage Americans to invest in stocks boosted equity markets late last week, Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said.\n\nBassanese had misgivings about the plan, saying it reminded him of former U.S. President George Bush encouraging Americans to buy a home during a housing boom.\n\n\"It adds to my suspicion that this decade-long bull market could eventually end via a blow-off bubble, driven by central bank persistent low interest rate policy,\" he said in a note.\n\nLater in the week, flash manufacturing activity data for February are due for the euro zone, the United Kingdom and the United States. They are likely to capture some of the early impact of the viral epidemic.\n\nAction was relatively muted in currency markets, with the dollar up against the yen at 109.90 and the pound at $1.3015. It gained against the euro to $1.0840.\n\nThe risk-sensitive Aussie, which is also played as a liquid proxy for Chinese assets, ticked up 0.1% to $0.6721.\n\nThat left the dollar index flat at 99.135.\n\nIn commodities, gold fell 0.22% to $1,581.25 an ounce. [GOL/] Brent crude was flat at $57.31 a barrel and U.S. crude added 0.1% to $52.09.

The more-active second-month WTI benchmark CLc2 was up 95 cents, or 0.7%, at $54.44 a barrel.\n\nImmediately after the EIA data, Brent front month, front month WTI and second month WTI touched their highest in February.\n\n\"The overall (EIA) numbers were kind of bullish...

However, overall U.S. refinery utilization rates rose 1.4%, primarily as the refiners came out of maintenance.\n\nChina's move to cut its benchmark lending rate helped ease some worries about slowing demand in the world's second-biggest oil consumer and largest crude oil importer.\n\nAlso supporting oil prices were U.S. sanctions this week on a trading unit of Russian oil giant Rosneft for its ties with Venezuela's state-run PDVSA and conflict in Libya that has led to a blockade of its ports and oilfields.\n\nBrent could extend gains to $60.22 a barrel, as suggested by its wave pattern and

"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-apple-idUSKBN20B1Y4", "title": "Apple warns sales to fall short of target due to coronavirus impact", "body": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) warned on Monday it was unlikely to meet its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago as the world's most valuable technology firm became one of the biggest corporate casualties of China's coronavirus epidemic.\n\nThe rapidly spreading virus has killed nearly 1,900 in China and stricken some 72,000 people, confining millions to their homes, disrupting supply chains and delaying reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break.\n\nManufacturing facilities in China that produce Apple's iPhone and other electronics have begun to reopen, but they are ramping up more slowly than expected, Apple said. That will mean fewer iPhones available for sale around the world, making Apple one of the largest Western firms to be hurt by the outbreak.\n\nSome of its retail stores in the country remain closed or are operating at reduced hours, which will hurt sales this quarter. China accounted for 15% of Apple's revenue, or $13.6 billion, last quarter, and supplied 18% of revenue in the year-ago quarter.\n\nIn late January, Apple had forecast $63 billion to $67 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, which it said was a wider than normal range due to the uncertainty created by the virus. It did not offer a new revenue estimate nor provide a profit forecast on Monday.\n\n\"The magnitude of this impact to miss its revenue guidance midway through February is clearly worse than feared,\" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note.\n\nApple, worth $1.4 trillion by market capitalization, could face a torrid market reaction on Tuesday, when Wall Street reopens after the Presidents Day holiday, analysts said.\n\n\"If Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell,\" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\nShares of its Asian suppliers fell on the news, with Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) losing 2.4%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (2330.TW) down 1.8% and SK Hynix (000660.KS) shedding 3.3%.\n\nAnalysts have estimated that the virus may slash demand for smartphones by half in the first quarter in China, the world's biggest market for the devices.\n\nSHORT-TERM IMPACT?\n\nApple said it will reopen China stores \"as steadily and safely as we can,\" while global supplies of iPhones will be limited as manufacturers work toward operating plants at full capacity. It plans to provide more information in April, when it releases first-quarter results.\n\nWedbush said it remained optimistic that Apple would be able to recover from the coronavirus setback.\n\n\"While trying to gauge the impact of the iPhone miss and potential bounce back in the June quarter will be front and center for the Street, we remain bullish on Apple for the longer term,\" Ives said.\n\nThe disruption follows a strong December quarter for iPhone sales, which were up for the first time in a year.

world's top 20 economies vowed to monitor the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global growth and act if needed, as they said loose monetary policy and easing trade tensions would prompt a pick-up in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe Group of 20 (G20) finance ministers and central bank heads faced a sober presentation by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which predicted the epidemic would shave 0.1 percentage points off global growth.\n\n\"We will enhance global risk monitoring, including of the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We stand ready to take further action to address these risks,\" the statement from the financial leaders said, using the medical acronym for the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n\"Global growth is expected to pick up modestly in 2020 and 2021,\" they predicted. \"The recovery is supported by the continuation of accommodative financial conditions and some signs of easing trade tensions.\"\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said central bankers would look at options to respond to the epidemic if needed, while Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was ready to ease policy if necessary.\n\nChina was represented at the G20 meeting by its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, as senior officials stayed away due to the growing crisis over the virus.\n\nChinese state television quoted China's President Xi Jinping as saying on Sunday Beijing would step up policy adjustments to help cushion the blow on the economy from the outbreak.\n\n\"The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,\" Xi said, though he added the effects would be short-term and controllable.\n\nSaudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told a news conference at the meeting: \"We have discussed the outbreak of coronavirus in China and other countries and all the G20 countries agreed collectively on being ready to intervene with necessary policies.\"\n\nThe epidemic, which originated in China, has since spread to nearly 30 countries and territories.\n\nSouth Korea raised its infectious disease alert to its highest level on Sunday but the European Union saw \"no need to panic\" over an outbreak in Italy.\n\n\"In our current baseline scenario, announced policies are implemented and China's economy would return to normal in the second quarter,\" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Saturday.\n\n\"As a result, the impact on the world economy would be relatively minor and short-lived.\"\n\n\"But we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally, and the growth consequences are more protracted,\" she added.\n\nThe ministers and central bankers also encouraged further work by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on global rules to tax digital giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook.\n\nIntergovernmental group the OECD is to prepare technical assumptions by July that would allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.\n\nThe group's efforts were stalled late last year by last-minute changes demanded by Washington, including a proposed \"safe harbor\" regime which critics say would let multinationals choose whether to abide by the new set of rules or stick to existing regulations.\n\n\"I told my counterparts that Japan is very concerned about the 'safe harbor' proposal,\" Japan's Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters, joining a chorus of criticism by France and other nations over the U.S. proposal.\n\n\"It would extremely diminish the regulatory effect of what we're trying to do. That is a view expressed by various countries,\" he said.\n\nMnuchin warned, however, that he opposed discriminatory taxes on digital services, the providers of which are mostly from the United States.\n\nHe said Washington would respond with investigations and potential retaliatory tariffs if countries decided to go it alone, outside the OECD deal.\n\nA final agreement on the global rules is to be ready by the end of this year to avoid a proliferation of different digital tax regimes all over the world.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"},

drop in new coronavirus infections on Thursday although scientists warned the flu-like pathogen may spread even more easily than previously believed, while more passengers disembarked a quarantined cruise ship off Japan.\n\nTwo elderly passengers from the quarantined Diamond Princess ship had died of the disease, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. The passengers were a man and a woman in their 80s, NHK said, citing an unidentified government source.\n\nSouth Korea reported a spike in infections, with 23 new cases linked to a church congregation, up from 14 on Wednesday, in what health officials called a \"super-spreading event\".\n\nA 61-year-old woman known as \"Patient 31\" is suspected of passing the disease to others who attended religious services at a church in the central city of Daegu.\n\nHundreds of people are believed to have attended services with the woman in recent weeks at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, a religious movement founded in 1984 by South Korean Lee Man-hee, who is revered as a messiah by followers.\n\nScientists in China who studied nose and throat swabs from 18 patients infected with the new coronavirus say it behaves much more like influenza than other closely related viruses, and could be passed on by people before they show symptoms.\n\nThe preliminary findings published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine offer evidence that the novel coronavirus is not like other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n\n\"If confirmed, this is very important,\" said Dr. Gregory Poland, a sinologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved with the study.\n\nWhile the latest numbers on infections in mainland China suggest the epidemic there is slowing, it is unclear how much the fall in new cases is due to changes in diagnostic methodology or because fewer people are contracting the disease.\n\nChina's central Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, reported 349 new confirmed cases, down from 1,693 a day earlier and the lowest since Jan. 25. The death toll in the province rose by 108, bringing to total in China to over 2,100 deaths and 74,500 cases.\n\nTwo people died of the disease in Iran on Wednesday, Iranian officials said, bringing the death toll outside mainland China to eight. If the reported deaths on the quarantined ship are confirmed the toll outside mainland China would stand at 10.\n\nIn Japan, the government has come under intense criticism for its handling of an outbreak on a cruise ship carrying about 3,700 people, that was placed in quarantine off Yokohama on Feb. 3.\n\nA second group of about 600 Japanese and foreign passengers from the Diamond Princess was set to disembark on Thursday, after the first batch were released from quarantine a day earlier.\n\nHundreds of people who left the chip on Wednesday were placed in quarantine again in their home countries, with Australia and Hong Kong putting their returned citizens in supervised isolation for another two weeks.\n\nPassengers arriving in Hong Kong were taken straight into quarantine at a new public housing estate. A contingent of Australian evacuees were placed in quarantine at an old mining camp outside Darwin in the country's far north.\n\nEven as the first passengers disembarked on Wednesday, Japanese authorities announced 79 new cases had been discovered on board, bringing the total to at least 620, over half of the known infections outside mainland China.\n\nFrom the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers were not confined to rooms until Feb. 5. The day before, as passengers were being screened, ship events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Japan's efforts \"may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship.\"\n\nJapanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato defended Tokyo's efforts.\n\n\"Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases,\" Kato said in a report by state broadcaster NHK.\n\nWith China's Hubei province, home to some 60 million people, in virtual lockdown, strict limits on movement in several major Chinese cities, and bans on travel to and from the mainland, economists expect the world's second-biggest economy to take a short-term hit from the epidemic.\n\nFinancial leaders of the world's 20 largest economies (G20) said the coronavirus epidemic was a downside risk for the global economy, according to a draft communique prepared for a meeting on Feb. 22-23.\n\nAustralia's Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX) said on Thursday it will ground the equivalent of 18 planes, freeze recruitment and ask its 30,000 staff to use up annual leave as it grapples with falling demand in Asia due to the epidemic.\n\nAbout 80% of scheduled airline capacity to, from and within China has been cut this week, with Chinese airlines the hardest hit.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type":

International concern about the spread of coronavirus outside China grew on Sunday with sharp rises in infections in South Korea, Italy and Iran.\n\nThe government in Seoul put the country on high alert after the number of infections surged over 600 with six deaths. A focal point was a church in the southeastern city of Daegu, where a 61-year-old member of the congregation with no recent record of overseas travel tested positive for the virus.\n\nIn Italy, the number of cases jumped to above 130 from just three before Friday. Authorities sealed off the worst affected towns and banned public gatherings in much of the north, including halting the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases, to try to contain the biggest outbreak in Europe.\n\nItalian health authorities were struggling to find out how the virus started. \"If we cannot find 'patient zero' then it means the virus is even more ubiquitous than we thought,\" said Luca Zaia, the regional governor of the wealthy Veneto region.\n\nIran, which announced its first two cases on Wednesday, said it had confirmed 43 cases and eight deaths, with most of the infections in the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Qom.\n\nChina, which has seen the vast majority of cases, reported 648 new infections. But only 18 were outside of Hubei province, the lowest number outside the epicenter since authorities began publishing data a month ago and locked down large parts of the country.\n\n\"At present, the epidemic situation is still severe and complex, and prevention and control work is in the most difficult and critical stage,\" President Xi Jinping said.\n\nState run television urged people to avoid complacency, drawing attention to people gathering in public areas and tourist spots without wearing masks.\n\nThe virus has killed 2,442 people in China, which has reported 76,936 cases, and has slammed the brakes on the world's second largest economy. It has spread to some 26 other countries and territories, with a death toll of around two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.\n\n\"Despite the continuing decline in reported cases from China, the last two days have seen extremely concerning developments elsewhere in the world,\" said Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia.\n\nThe coronavirus has been fatal in 2% of reported cases, with the elderly and ill the most vulnerable, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which said on Saturday it was worried by the detection of infections without a clear link to China.\n\nIn South Korea, Catholic churches in Daegu and Gwangju have suspended services and other gatherings, while churches elsewhere saw declines in attendance on Sunday, especially among the elderly.\n\n\"If the situation gets worse, I think we'll need to take more measures,\" said Song Gi-young, 53, wearing a face mask at church.\n\nHeo Young-moo, 88, expressed frustration.\n\n\"Devotees shouldn't go to any risky places ... Hasn't it become so widespread because those people didn't get checked?\",\" he said.\n\nSouth Korea's president said raising the disease alert to the highest level allowed authorities to send extra resources to Daegu city and Cheongdo county, which were designated \"special care zones\" on Friday.\n\nIt also enables the government to forcibly prevent public activities and order the temporary closure of schools, the Yonhap News Agency said, although the government gave no immediate details on what steps could be taken.\n\nHealth officials reported 169 new infections, bringing the total to 602.\n\nConcern about the reach of the coronavirus also grew in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nIn Italy, schools and universities were closed and some soccer matches postponed in the affected northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the country's industrial heartland.\n\nAlmost a dozen towns in Lombardy and Veneto with a combined population of some 50,000 have effectively been placed under quarantine, with locals urged to stay home and special permission needed to enter or leave the designated areas.\n\nThe European Union said it had confidence in the Italian authorities. \"We share concern for possible contagion (but) there is no need to panic,\" the bloc's Economic Affairs Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told reporters.\n\nIran reported a total of 43 infections, with eight deaths - all since Tuesday. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey and Afghanistan imposed travel and immigration restrictions on Iran.\n\nThe potential economic impact of the disease was prominent at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Riyadh.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund chief said China's 2020 growth would likely be lower at 5.6%, down 0.4 percentage points from its January outlook, with 0.1 percentage points shaved from global growth.\n\nXi highlighted the importance of fighting the epidemic in the capital Beijing, which has recently required people arriving from elsewhere in China to be quarantined at home for 14 days.\n\nHe said it would have a relatively big, but short-term impact on the economy and that Beijing would step up policy adjustments to help cushion the blow.\n\nIn Japan, where the government is facing growing questions about whether it is doing enough to counter the virus, authorities had confirmed 773 cases by early Sunday evening.\n\nMost of them were from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo, the Diamond Princess. A third passenger, a Japanese man in his 80s, died on Sunday.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe instructed government agencies to urgently prepare medical provisions and draft a comprehensive plan to curb the spread.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

dies", "body": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italy raced on Sunday to contain the biggest outbreak of coronavirus in Europe, sealing off the worst affected towns and banning public events in much of the north as a third patient died of the illness.\n\nAuthorities in the wealthy regions of Lombardy and Veneto, which are the focal point of the flare-up, ordered schools and universities to close for at least a week, shut museums and cinemas and called off the last two days of the Venice Carnival.\n\nThe civil protection unit said the number of cases of the highly contagious virus totaled 152, all but three of them coming to light since Friday.\n\n\"I was surprised by this explosion of cases,\" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told state broadcaster RAI, warning that the numbers would likely rise in the coming days. \"We will do everything we can to contain the contagion,\" he said.\n\nThe latest death was an elderly woman from the town of Crema, some 45 km (28 miles) east of Italy's financial capital Milan. Like at least one of the other people who have died, she had been suffering from serious underlying health issues, officials said.\n\nThe number of certified cases of the illness in Lombardy rose to 110 from 54 a day earlier, while in Veneto some 21 people were diagnosed with the virus, including two people in Venice, which was packed with tourists for carnival season.\n\nHealth officials reported isolated cases in the neighboring regions of Piedmont and Emilia Romagna.\n\nThe regional governor of Veneto, Luca Zaia, said he had dealt with numerous natural disasters during his long career, including floods and earthquakes. \"But this is the absolutely worst problem that Veneto has faced,\" he told reporters.\n\nAlmost a dozen towns in Lombardy and Veneto with a combined population of some 50,000 have effectively been placed under quarantine, with locals urged to stay home and special permission needed to enter or leave the designated areas.\n\nIn Milan, residents rushed to stock up on essentials, while some parents decided to take their children out of the city.\n\n\"Today is madness. It feels like we're in Baghdad. We can't restock shelves quick enough,\" said a shop assistant at the Esselunga Solari supermarket in Milan, declining to give her name because she was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nLombardy and Veneto together account for 30% of Italy's gross domestic output. Any prolonged disruption there is likely to have a serious impact on the whole economy, which is already close to recession.\n\nTourism looks certain to take an immediate hit, with schools across the country calling off trips, including traditional week-long skiing holidays.\n\nMilan's famous La Scala opera house canceled performances and bars and discos in Lombardy were told to close by 6 p.m. (1700 GMT). Some major sporting events were postponed, including four Serie A soccer matches scheduled for Sunday.\n\nHealth authorities are trying to work out how the outbreak in the north started.\n\nInitial suspicion in Lombardy fell on a businessman recently returned from China, the epicenter of the new virus, but he has tested negative. In Veneto, doctors tested a group of eight Chinese visitors who had been to the town that was home to the first fatality, but again, they tested negative.\n\n\"We are (now) even more worried because if we cannot find 'patient zero' then it means the virus is even more ubiquitous than we thought,\" Zaia said.\n\nBefore Friday, Italy had reported just three cases of the virus - all of them people who had recently arrived from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the illness emerged late last year.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said it was concerned by the upsurge in new cases and a lack of clarity over its spread.\n\n\"I am sending a ... team to Italy to work together to learn about virus spread and (how to) contain it,\" the WHO's European Regional Director Hans Kluge said on Twitter.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lombardy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lombardy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_48_(Weimar_Constitution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attilio_Fontana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attilio Fontana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Veneto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Sala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giuseppe Sala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regions of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Armani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giorgio Armani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Preparedness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Emergency Preparedness", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number_Theory", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number Theory", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200223&t=2&i=1494085187&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG1M0D8", "eventUri": "eng-5537595", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 8325, "pinterest": 3}, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 8328, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1451563534", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-02-18", "time": "01:42:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-18T01:42:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-18T01:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-idUSKBN20C03X", "title": "Coronavirus cases in China's Hubei fall for second day, Apple and...", "body": "BEIJING/GENEVA (Reuters) - New coronavirus cases in the Chinese province at the epicenter of the outbreak fell for a second straight day, but deaths rose after the World Health Organization had cautioned there was not yet enough data to know if the epidemic had slowed.\n\nHubei reported 1,693 new cases as of Tuesday, down from 1,807 the previous day and the lowest number in the province since Feb. 11. But deaths rose by 132, up from 93 the previous day. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to over 74,000 with about 2,000 deaths.\n\nThe head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the novel virus first appeared at the end of last year.\n\nIllustrating the impact of the outbreak on worldwide growth and corporate profits, oil prices tumbled and equity markets slid after Apple Inc (AAPL.O) issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the disease is causing to global supply chains.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data \"appears to show a decline in new cases\" but any apparent trend \"must be interpreted very cautiously.\"\n\nOutside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, known as COVID-19, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.\n\nTedros said there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China.\n\n\"We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,\" he said.\n\nRussia, however, was taking no chances. Starting on Thursday, it will suspend entry of many Chinese citizens.\n\nBy the end of this week, the WHO said, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are due to have the ability to detect COVID-19.\n\n\"Many of these countries have been sending samples to other countries for testing, waiting several days for results. Now they can do it themselves within 24-48 hours,\" Tedros said.\n\nChina says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.\n\nThe WHO's Mike Ryan said China had success with \"putting out the fire\" first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored.\n\n\"Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,\" Ryan said\n\nThe numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious.\n\nChinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients.\n\nDespite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China's ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be \"limited, short-term and manageable\" and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed.\n\nChinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.\n\nEconomists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.\n\n\"The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we'll see a big round of layoffs,\" said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast.\n\nBritain's biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.\n\nComponents made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world, and Hubei province is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods.\n\nSingapore announced a $4.5 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact.\n\nJapan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

Germany's auto heartlands in peril as 'golden...", "body": "BAMBERG, Germany (Reuters) - When Kristin and Thomas Schmitt took out a mortgage and bought a house last summer, the German couple's dream looked as if it was coming true. Two months later, they learned that the tire factory where both work would be shut down early next year.\n\nA malaise in Germany's mighty automobile industry, caused by weaker demand from abroad, stricter emission rules and electrification, is starting to leave a wider mark on Europe's largest economy by pushing up unemployment, eroding job security and hitting pay.\n\n\"It's a nightmare. This is pulling the rug out from under our feet,\" said Kristin Schmitt, 40, of the plant closure in the Bavarian region of Bamberg, one of Germany's auto supplier hubs.\n\nThe couple, who have three children, still hopes managers at their Michelin tire factory change their mind, but the risk of unemployment looms large - and not only for the Schmitts.\n\nThe German auto sector is expected to cut nearly a tenth of its 830,000 jobs in the next decade, according to the VDA industry association.\n\nSome think-tanks and government officials fear that the toll will be higher as electric cars provide less assembly work than combustion engine vehicles, simple work steps are replaced by automation and companies relocate production.\n\nThis is not yet 1970s Detroit, a U.S. car center that was plagued by urban decay as factory relocations, cheaper imports and higher fuel prices destroyed jobs.\n\nBut the danger is growing, automotive companies, workers, as well as regional and labor leaders, told Reuters.\n\nDifferent firms are taking different steps. At the Schmitts' plant in Hallstadt, workers are trying to avoid forced layoffs; at a Bosch factory in nearby Bamberg, pay cuts and reduced hours have been agreed, as has investment in new fuel cell technology.\n\nWith pockets of rising joblessness in the affluent, auto-producing heartlands of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg in southern Germany, there are serious implications for a country which relies on the car industry for roughly 5% of its economic output and, and an important part of its national identity.\n\n\"Germany is entering uncharted waters. The transition could well mark the end of the golden age for cars as a mass employer,\" said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management, a German research institute.\n\n\"For politics, it's a ticking time bomb.\"\n\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus is adding to the crisis by disrupting global supply chains and dampening passenger car sales in China, an important market for German manufacturers.\n\nThreats of mass lay-offs will be a defining feature of upcoming wage negotiations in the metalworking industry where unions are focusing more on job security than pay hikes.\n\n\"It could well be that we have passed the peak of automotive production,\" Volkmar Denner, CEO of Germany's largest car supplier Robert Bosch, said in January when he announced massive job cuts and a business review to cope with plunging profits.\n\nThe Schmitts live north of the city of Bamberg, whose medieval and baroque architecture has been lovingly restored since the 1950s. It is typical of the well-heeled cities that prospered during the \"economic miracle\" of Germany's post-war reconstruction.\n\nYet this region, which heavily depends on combustion engine technology, is facing a challenge that will have repercussions for Germany as a whole.\n\n\"We're talking here about some 25,000 jobs in the region; that's roughly 15% of the overall workforce,\" Bamberg mayor Andreas Starke told Reuters. \"This shows how dependent the region is on combustion engines.\"\n\nFor the Schmitts - Thomas works on the assembly line and Kristin in the stockroom - and their more than 850 colleagues at the Michelin tire factory, the chances of keeping their jobs are looking grim.\n\nWorks council head Josef Morgenroth is trying to convince the management that the company can't pull out of an earlier agreement which ruled out forced lay-offs until the end of 2022.\n\nThe local Michelin management declined to comment, saying it was still in talks with the works council.\n\nTo help workers affected by the car industry disruption, politicians, companies and labor unions have called on the government to support the shift to alternative technologies such as electric cars or hydrogen-powered fuel cells.\n\nIn a rare joint statement, automakers and unions said in January that Berlin must expand state-backed employment schemes, known as Kurzarbeit, to cover a longer pay subsidy period of up to 24 months as well as retraining in new skills such as building electric vehicle parts.\n\nThe German cabinet is expected to approve the more flexible Kurzarbeit rules next month. Under the scheme, companies can apply for state aid to avoid lay-offs and keep skilled workers for a limited time of currently up to 12 months.\n\nDepending on agreements between company and works council, employees work reduced hours or even stay at home, with the government paying two-thirds of the lost net income.\n\nFor the economy as a whole, this means consumers have less money to spend, eroding Germany's most important pillar of economic support in recent years as exports falter. That in turn could become an issue for the European Central Bank as it seeks to stimulate the wider euro zone economy with a limited arsenal.\n\nResearch institute GfK expects German household spending to grow by 1% in 2020, down from roughly 1.5% last year.\n\nEven without the planned changes, the number of employees already forced to work in Kurzarbeit schemes jumped to 96,000 in November, up from about 20,000 two years before, and surpassing levels last seen during the euro zone debt crisis in 2012/13, according to the Federal Labour Office.\n\nProjections suggest that the number will rise to 117,000 this month, with the increase mainly due to the problems in the car industry, said Detlef Scheele, head of the state agency.\n\nSome auto suppliers have cut pay without applying for state aid under the short-time schemes.\n\nAt the Bosch factory, management and the works council sealed a deal to avoid forced lay-offs until 2026 under the condition that all 7,000 employees reduce working hours and accept a pay cut of nearly 10% from April 2020.\n\n\"Of course, this is causing mixed feelings,\" said Sven Bachmann, production manager at the plant, which is 100% focused on combustion engine parts. \"For me personally, the relief prevails that my job is safe for the next six years.\"\n\nIn addition, the company pledged to invest in fuel cells, which could become an important alternative energy source for trucks and buildings over the next 10 years.\n\n\"This pledge is really important because it shows Bosch is not only thinking about cutting costs, but also about securing future growth and jobs,\" works council head Mario Gutmann told Reuters.\n\nThe city of Bamberg is complementing the efforts by building a new district on an old U.S. military base where stationary fuel cells, powered with hydrogen, will provide electricity, heating and warm water for up to 1,000 apartments.\n\nMayor Starke is hoping that Bamberg's efforts to diversify its local economy can help cushion the negative effects of the car crisis on the regional labor market.\n\nThere's a lot at stake for people like the Schmitts.\n\n\"We canceled our holidays, we also told the children that we have to scale back special treats,\" Kristin said. \"Now, we all pray that we can keep the house.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"},
