But it's not enough from an equity market perspective,\" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. \"What we now need is leadership out of Congress to pass some sort of stimulus bill, because what the Fed's doing is relieving some problems, but it doesn't do enough to solve to solve what's out there.\"\n\nInvestors had hoped the U.S. Senate would clear a $1 trillion-plus coronavirus stimulus package over the weekend, but Democrats and Republicans were still scrambling to come to an agreement.\n\nMaryland, Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware joined New York and California in asking people to stay home, foreshadowing a near halt in economic activity and more pain for U.S. equities, and prompting several analysts to slash their growth forecasts.\n\nGoldman Sachs expects an outright contraction in global real gross domestic product in 2020 on the back of a 24% plunge in U.S. real GDP in the second quarter: two-and-a-half times as large as the previous post-war record.\n\nThe S&P 500 has experienced a $9 trillion wipeout to its value since the benchmark index hit a record high last month. A rush for safe-haven assets like government bonds caused U.S. Treasury yields to fall on Monday.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down about 34% from its February record high, its lowest level since fears of the coronavirus swept across Wall Street.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI dropped 3.12% to end at 18,576.04 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost 2.96% to 2,236.7.

The U.S. Senate on Wednesday unanimously backed a $2 trillion bill aimed at helping unemployed workers and industries hurt by the coronavirus epidemic, as well as providing billions of dollars to buy urgently needed medical equipment.\n\nAfter bitter negotiations, the deeply divided Senate came together and passed the bill by a 96-0 vote, which sent the massive stimulus package to the House of Representatives for a vote on Friday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, whose top aides helped negotiate the bipartisan measure, promised to sign it into law as soon as it reaches his desk. \"I will sign it immediately,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe rescue package - which would be the biggest ever passed by Congress - includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount for direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to millions of U.S. families.\n\nThe legislation will also provide $350 billion for small-business loans, $250 billion for expanded unemployment aid and at least $100 billion for hospitals and related health systems.\n\nSenate leaders noted the historic nature of the challenge posed by the coronavirus, which the Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called \"a strange and evil disease.\"\n\nThe package is intended to flood the economy with cash in a bid to stem the impact of an intensifying epidemic that has killed more than 900 people in the United States and infected at least 60,000.\n\nOnly two other nations, China and Italy, have more coronavirus cases and the World Health Organization has warned the United States looks set to become the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTop aides to Trump and senior senators from both parties announced that they had agreed on the unprecedented stimulus bill in the early hours of Wednesday after five days of talks.\n\nBut it was delayed by criticism from both the right and left on Wednesday, pushing the final vote on passage almost another full day.\n\nSeveral Republican senators had insisted the bill needed to be changed to ensure that laid-off workers would not be paid more in unemployment benefits than they earned on the job. However, an amendment that would have changed the unemployment provision failed just before the Senate approved the measure.\n\nThere had been criticism of the bill from the most progressive wing of the Democratic-led House. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called it \"a historic corporate giveaway\" on Twitter.\n\nHowever, House leaders hoped the bill would pass by voice vote on Friday, without representatives having to return to Washington. Bringing more than 400 lawmakers from as far away as Hawaii and Alaska would be difficult because a few are in self-quarantine and several states have issued stay-at-home orders.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hoped the bill would pass quickly, and that Congress would pass further legislation if necessary to ease the crisis going forward.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo had criticized the bill, saying the $3.8 billion allocated to his state would not cover tax revenue it will lose from reduced economic activity. New York accounts for roughly half of all U.S. coronavirus cases.\n\nPelosi expressed sympathy, but wanted the rescue package to move on. \"We (Congress) do have to do more, but that would be no reason to stop this step that we are taking,\" she told CNN.\n\nThe stimulus package follows two others that became law earlier this month. The money at stake amounts to nearly half of the $4.7 trillion the U.S. government spends annually.\n\nInvestors were cheered by the news of the deal. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX rallied for a second straight day, closing up 1.15%.\n\n\"Our nation obviously is going through a kind of crisis that is totally unprecedented in living memory,\" Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said shortly before the vote on passage.\n\nMcConnell also announced that, after passing the bill, the Senate would leave Washington and be in recess at least until April 20. He said he would give senators 24 hours notice if they needed to come back to Washington for another vote before then.\n\nMissing from Wednesday's votes was No. 2 Senate Republican John Thune, who said in a statement he did not feel well when he woke up on Wednesday and decided to take a charter flight home to South Dakota \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\n\nThune did not say whether he had coronavirus symptoms, although he said he was not advised to self-quarantine.\n\nAnother Republican senator, Rand Paul, announced on Sunday he had tested positive for the illness, and a handful of others have self-quarantined after being exposed to Paul or others who have had it.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

respectively.\n\nBoeing surged 24%, bringing its gain over the past three sessions to almost 70%, as investors bet on government support for the aerospace industry as well as airlines. American Airlines Group (AAL.O), United Airlines Holding (UAL.O) and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) each jumped more than 10%.\n\nBoeing, long a symbol of U.S. manufacturing strength, remains down by more than 50% since mid-February.\n\nWednesday marked the first time since Feb. 12 that S&P 500 climbed two days in a row. Even after its late-day retreat from its highs, the Dow's 14% gain over two sessions was its strongest two-day percent performance since 1987.\n\n\"What the fiscal and monetary stimulus has done is to allow the market to recover,\" said Justin Hoogendoorn, head of fixed income strategy at Piper Jaffray in Chicago. \"It's not because the main street community is coming back. It's the institutional crowd being able to say, 'the world isn't falling apart'.\"\n\nTop aides to Republican President Donald Trump and senior Senate Republicans and Democrats said they had agreed on the unprecedented stimulus bill, which includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount for direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to millions of U.S. families.\n\nHowever, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he was prepared to put a hold on the bill unless a group of Republican senators drop their objections to language on jobless benefits in the legislation.\n\nTop House Republican Kevin McCarthy said he wanted House members to have at least 24 hours after the Senate vote to review the bill.\n\nWith fears of a global recession and corporate defaults running high, and expectations of a continued surge in cases of the illness caused by the new coronavirus in the United States, many investors remained reluctant to call an end to Wall Street's recent, staggering selloff.\n\n\"We are still in a phase where we need to be cautious,\" warned Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \"We don't yet know when these social distancing measures will end, and the evidence for now is that they will continue to expand.\"\n\nData due on Thursday is likely to show U.S. weekly jobless claims surging to 1 million as companies announce layoffs and as state-wide lockdowns force businesses to shutter stores.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) fell late in the session, closing down 0.55% after Nikkei reported the company could delay the launch of an iPhone with 5G wireless technology.\n\nThe S&P 500 remains down about 27% from its February record high, a loss of more than $7 trillion in stock market value.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises (RCL.N) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH.N) each rallied about 23%. Both companies have been among the hardest hit from the pandemic.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.55-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 4 new highs and 57 new lows.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ-100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASDAQ-100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Mini-Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Mini-Basketball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200325&t=2&i=1507934831&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2O0VG", "eventUri": "eng-5629226", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "shares": {"facebook": 17940}, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 17940, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "6005333375", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-03-24", "time": "03:58:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-24T03:58:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-24T03:58:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mexico-president-idUSKBN21B0DL", "title": "Mexican president vows to bail out the poor, not big companies, in...", "body": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday he would focus his response to the coronavirus outbreak on helping the poor rather than major companies as the virus spreads in Mexico, and that he would unveil more details on Tuesday.\n\nOfficials counted 367 cases on Monday, up from 316 the day before, with a total of four deaths, including two people who had diabetes.\n\nAlthough the government has yet to take drastic measures to slow the contagion, such as issuing travel bans or requiring self-isolation, it has banned large events, suspended classes in primary schools and recommended people keep distance from others.

The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote to approve the measure Friday and President Donald Trump has promised to sign it into law.\n\nSenate Republicans had fought what they called a give away to airlines and initially offered only loans, while airlines had threatened to start laying off tens of thousands within days if they did not get cash.\n\n\"This is not a corporate bailout; it's a rescue package for workers,\" said Association of Flight Attendants Sara Nelson, who spearheaded the idea of direct payroll grants for employees ranging from janitorial staff and gate agents to mechanics and pilots.\n\nReuters reported Chao worked the phones late into the night talking to air carriers about what they needed to ensure they could maintain payrolls, a person briefed on call on Tuesday that lawmakers were nearing agreement on a deal for cash grants for payroll and other employee costs, after airlines made a last-minute effort to convince lawmakers they needed the cash to prevent furloughing tens of thousands of workers.\n\nU.S. airline shares extended a Tuesday rally on hopes for cash relief and under the bill airlines are set to get cash assistance in as little as two weeks.\n\nRepublican Senator Pat Toomey, whose party had proposed $58 billion in loans, said on Wednesday the grants were a key sticking point. He said Democrats insisted \"we give away money to airlines and never get it back.\"\n\nIn a win for labor, companies receiving funds cannot lay off employees before Sept. 30 or change collective bargaining agreements.\n\nThe bill has restrictions on stock buybacks, dividends and executive compensation, and allows the government to take equity, warrants or other compensation as part of the rescue package, but does not require it.\n\nAirlines would also receive tax relief on fuel purchases and, in a move that may bring down passenger fares, a temporary suspension on ticket taxes.\n\nAs the coronavirus has spread around the world, travel demand has plummeted, with airlines drastically reducing flights and warning of more cuts to come.\n\nAirlines keep canceling flights, borrowing money and slashing costs as demand falls.\n\nAlaska Airlines said Wednesday it would cut its flights by 70% in April and May, while United Airlines said Wednesday would now cut 52% of U.S. flights and overall capacity by 68%. On Tuesday, 279,018 people were screened at all U.S. airport checkpoints, down 87% over last year.\n\nAirlines accepting loans may have to ensure certain air services in order to maintain health care and pharmaceutical supply chains, including to remote communities, but other consumer and environmental protections sought by many Democrats did not make it into the bill.\n\nAirlines and unions won crucial support for the grants from U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who worked the phones late into the night, telling lawmakers and others in the administration she was concerned about the impact of job losses and a decline in the U.S. aviation sector on competition, people briefed on the matter said.\n\n\"Without grants, airlines may be forced to choose bankruptcy over federal loans, if loan conditions are too inflexible,\" Chao warned in a memo seen by Reuters.\n\nAirlines have argued that they are key to restarting the economy once the coronavirus outbreak subsides.\n\nU.S. airports, whose concourses have been nearly empty, are set to receive $10 billion in grants.\n\nThe government will also provide $25 billion in grants for U.S. transit systems and $1 billion for U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak, that have seen ridership fall dramatically as states ordered tens of millions of Americans to stay home and avoid non-essential travel.\n\nBoeing Co could receive government loans under a $17 billion fund set aside for direct national security-related loans, Toomey said, adding that many companies could qualify. Boeing could also qualify under the broader $454 billion loan program.\n\n\"It is not meant to be exclusively for Boeing... You should not think of it as a Boeing allocation,\" Toomey said.\n\nBoeing had sought at least $60 billion in government loan guarantees for itself and the entire aerospace manufacturing sector.

Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI wrapped up its strongest three days in nine decades on Thursday as record weekly U.S. jobless claims came in below investors' worst fears and the focus stayed on an unprecedented $2 trillion stimulus awaiting approval by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe Dow finished up 21% from its Monday low, establishing it in a bull market, according to a widely used definition. It was the index's strongest three-day percentage increase since 1931.\n\nThe number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to 3.28 million last week as state-wide lockdowns brought the U.S. economy to a halt and unleashed a wave of layoffs.\n\nThe median expectation of analysts polled by Reuters was for 1 million claims, but the top end of the forecast was as high as 4 million.\n\nExpectations are high that the House will pass the stimulus measure to support distressed industries, including airlines, after the Senate cleared the proposal. It would flood the country with cash in an effort to stem the crushing economic impact of an intensifying pandemic that has killed about 1,000 and infected nearly 70,000 people in the United States.\n\nThe S&P 500 .SPX benchmark index also logged a third straight day of gains for the first time since mid-February, before coronavirus fears stopped Wall Street's 11-year bull market. Since Monday, the S&P 500 has surged about 17%, although it remains down 22% from its Feb. 19 record high.\n\n\"It's encouraging to see people buying a day after a big up day because we hadn't seen that in a month,\" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading & derivatives at Charles Schwab. \"That doesn't guarantee that the bottom is in, but it is indicative of a bottoming process.\"\n\nWhile the Dow's surge may be viewed as birth of a new bull market after just six week in a bear market, many investors fear Wall Street could plunge again as coronavirus infections increase and more people die.\n\n\"The price swings we have seen, both to the upside and to the downside, have been really exaggerated over the past month. So getting a big bounce now is more a function of the weakness we have seen than an indicator of what lies ahead,\" warned Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Robert W.

Infections were now doubling every three days in New York and the worst could still be two to three weeks away, said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nNationwide, COVID-19, which broke out late last year in Wuhan, China, has infected more than 53,000 people and killed at least 720.\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared major disasters for New York and Washington state, the nation's first hot spot and accounting for at least 117 deaths, and said he would soon do the same for California.\n\n\"We are enduring a great national trial,\" Trump said. The president softened a vow to reopen the nation's economy by Easter, saying he'll listen to experts first, including Birx and Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nIn California, where 51 people have died and 2,200 tested positive, Governor Gavin Newsom said fully half the confirmed cases were between the ages of 18 and 49, figures he said are \"a reminder for everybody to take this seriously.\"\n\nNewsom cited the death of a teenage boy in Los Angeles County, although health officials there said the case was complex and an \"alternate explanation\" is possible.\n\nNewsom, who warned that half of Californians - or about 25 million people - could potentially be infected in the coming two months, said the next six to eight weeks would be pivotal in determining whether a clampdown on residents has slowed the spread of coronavirus.\n\nCalifornia also desperately lacks the hospital beds it needs to care for so many critically ill patients, Newsom has said, although Tesla co-founder Elon Musk \"came through on his promise\" to deliver over 1,000 badly needed hospital ventilators, and the state brought another 3,000 online.\n\nThe U.S. Navy hospital ship Mercy was expected to arrive at in Los Angeles on Friday with 1,000 hospital beds to ease the burden on the state's healthcare system.\n\nDespite the crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933 after U.S. lawmakers said they were close to a deal for a massive economic rescue package in response to the outbreak.\n\nThe World Health Organization said on Tuesday the United States had the potential to become the global epicenter of the pandemic, citing a \"very large acceleration\" in coronavirus infections.\n\nDemocrats, including Governor Cuomo, have criticized Trump, a Republican, for suggesting he would reopen the nation's economy by mid-April.\n\n\"If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it's no contest. No American is going to say accelerate the economy at the cost of human life,\" Cuomo said earlier in the day.\n\nNewsom did not criticize Trump but said April would be \"sooner than any of the experts that I've talked to would believe is possible\" for California to lift its restrictions.\n\nThe governors of at least 18 states in recent days have issued stay-at-home directives. The sweeping orders, unprecedented in their breadth and depth, encompass about half the nation's population.\n\nThe rules are based on social distancing principles designed to put more space between individuals in order to slow the spread of the highly contagious and potentially lethal virus.\n\nEven before the first statewide controls went into effect last week in California, the coronavirus pandemic had virtually paralyzed sectors of the U.S. economy and upended daily lives of Americans as school districts and colleges canceled classes.\n\nAmericans reported frayed nerves after days of working from home, unable to take part in many activities and looking after children with no schools to attend.\n\nTerri Gilbert Thompson, 44, and her husband Scott, both teachers in Hilltown, Pennsylvania juggled teaching remotely with homeschooling their own three children.\n\n\"It has been a challenge, but we are willing to make it work to ensure that the virus doesn't spread,\" Thompson said. \"We're doing our best to keep our students engaged in learning, monitor and enrich our own kids' learning, while maintaining our own sanity during this challenging time.\"", "source": {"uri":

Global airlines urged the world's major economies to act quickly to prevent irreversible damage to an industry that has seen demand decimated almost overnight by the coronavirus crisis.\n\nSeveral states have already stepped in to help airlines hammered by the travel slump, with the United States offering $58 billion in aid, Singapore announcing support for aviation and Australia easing competition rules.\n\nAs leaders from the Group of 20 nations met for a video summit, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) asked governments to provide or facilitate financial support for the major carriers it represents.\n\n\"The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe and the resulting government-mandated border closings and travel restrictions have led to the destruction of air travel demand,\" IATA Chief Executive Alexandre de Juniac said in an open letter.\n\nUnderlining the industry's plight, AirAsia, the region's biggest budget carrier, became the latest to announce sweeping schedule cuts and said some of its businesses would halt flights altogether for a period.\n\nSingapore Airlines said it would tap existing investors for up to S$15 billion ($10.5 billion) through the sale of shares and convertible bonds to offset the shock to its business from the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIt also arranged a S$4 billion bridge loan.\n\n\"Many airlines have been paying out more in refunds than they have received in new booking revenues,\" de Juniac, a former head of Air France-KLM, said.\n\n\"The average two-month cash reserves held by airlines are rapidly being exhausted,\" de Juniac added, calling for direct financial support, loans or tax relief.\n\nIn a desperate bid to preserve some revenues and keep global supply chains operating, U.S. Delta Air Lines, Air New Zealand and Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways joined a list of carriers that have offered to charter passenger planes as freight transporters, using their spacious cargo holds.\n\nAbout half of the world's air cargo normally travels in the bellies of passenger planes, so the cancellation of passenger flights has led to a sharp reduction in capacity, with knock-on effects on food, industry and other trade.\n\nU.S. airlines, like others around the globe, have been reeling from the slide in passenger numbers and on Wednesday the U.S. Senate passed a $58 billion rescue package, half in the form of grants to cover some 750,000 airline staff wages.\n\nThose receiving funds cannot lay off employees before Sept. 30 or change collective bargaining pacts. [L1N2BI0XW]\n\nThe bill has restrictions on stock buybacks, dividends and executive pay, and allows the government to take equity, warrants or other compensation as part of the package.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives is expected to back the move on Friday. President Donald Trump has promised to sign it.\n\nIATA, which estimates the pandemic will cost the global industry $252 billion in lost revenues this year, said earlier it had written to 18 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including India, Japan and South Korea for emergency support.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have joined other governments in announcing some financial relief. But this has not stopped carriers from putting staff on leave and grounding planes.\n\nVirgin Australia plans to permanently cut more than 1,000 jobs among the 8,000 staff that have already been stood down. Australia's Flight Centre Travel Group said it would cut 6,000 travel agent roles globally.\n\nIn a move unthinkable under normal conditions, Australia's competition regulator said it would allow Virgin, Qantas Airways and Regional Express to temporarily coordinate schedules and share revenue on 10 regional routes.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"},

Prince Charles, the 71-year-old heir to the British throne, has tested positive for coronavirus but is in good health and is now self isolating in Scotland with mild symptoms.\n\nCharles, eldest son of Queen Elizabeth, is displaying what Clarence House said were mild symptoms but remains in good health and has been working from his Birkhall residence in Scotland. His wife, Camilla, 72, tested negative.\n\n\"The Prince of Wales has tested positive for coronavirus,\" Clarence House said. \"He has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.\"\n\n\"The Duchess of Cornwall has also been tested but does not have the virus,\" Clarence House said. Queen Elizabeth who is currently at Windsor Castle is in good health, Buckingham Palace said.\n\nA royal source said the Prince of Wales, who was tested on Monday and got the results on Tuesday, was advised the condition was unlikely to escalate into a more serious case.\n\nCharles has spoken to both Queen Elizabeth and to his sons, Prince William and Harry.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson wished the prince a speedy recovery and was due to hold his weekly audience with the queen by telephone, Johnson's spokesman said. The United States wished Prince Charles a speedy recovery, a senior Trump administration official said.\n\nCharles last saw the 93-year-old monarch on the morning of March 12 following an investiture, before the earliest time he is likely to have been infectious.\n\n\"Her Majesty The Queen remains in good health,\" Buckingham Palace said. \"The Queen last saw The Prince of Wales briefly after the investiture on the morning of 12th March and is following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare.\"\n\nA royal source said that the earliest Charles would have been infectious was March 13. Charles and Camilla went to Highgrove House, his residence in west England, on March 13 and then travelled to their Birkhall residence on the Balmoral estate in Scotland on Sunday.\n\nScotland's chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said both Charles and Camilla had been tested for \"clinical reasons\" and that both were in good health.\n\nQueen Elizabeth left London for Windsor Castle on March 19. She is with her 98-year-old husband, Philip. When asked if the queen or Philip had been tested for coronavirus, Buckingham Palace declined to comment.\n\n\"It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks,\" Clarence House said.\n\nCharles met Prince Albert of Monaco, who later tested positive, at a charity event in London on March 10.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George IV of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmoral_Castle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balmoral Castle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windsor Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Test_and_Measurement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Test and Measurement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200325&t=2&i=1507959778&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2O11I", "eventUri": "eng-5628861", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 13882}, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 13882, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6008435396", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-26", "time": "10:09:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-26T10:09:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-26T10:08:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4313725531101227, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress-idUSKBN21D1A7", "title": "U.S. House leaders determined to pass $2.2 trillion coronavirus bill", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives are determined to pass a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill on Friday, or at the very latest on Saturday, hoping to provide the quickest help possible as deaths mount and the economy reels.\n\nOn a call with fellow Democrats on Thursday afternoon, Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged House members not to do anything to delay the unprecedented economic aid package that the U.S. Senate backed unanimously on Wednesday night, lawmakers and aides said.\n\nBut there were warnings later on Thursday that at least one Republican might act to delay the vote into the weekend.\n\nRepresentative Madeleine Dean said the message on Pelosi's two-hour call was \"Let's get this done tomorrow if we possibly can. If not, at the very latest Saturday.\"\n\nDean said she would drive to Washington from her Pennsylvania district for the debate, due to start on Friday morning. \"It was so obvious from everyone's conversation on the call, we know what we have to do. We have to get relief to the American people now,\" Dean said.\n\nThe Senate bill - which would be the largest fiscal relief measure ever passed by the U.S. Congress - will rush direct payments to Americans within three weeks if the Democratic-controlled House backs it and Republican President Donald Trump signs it into law.\n\n\"The House of Representatives must now pass this bill, hopefully without delay. I think it's got tremendous support,\" Trump said at a daily coronavirus briefing.\n\nThe $2.2 trillion measure includes $500 billion to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount for payments of up to $3,000 to millions of families.\n\nThe legislation will also provide $350 billion for small-business loans, $250 billion for expanded unemployment aid and at least $100 billion for hospitals and related health systems.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate approved it 96-0 late on Wednesday. The unanimous vote, a rare departure from bitter partisanship in Washington, underscored how seriously members of Congress are taking the global pandemic as Americans suffer and the medical system threatens to buckle.\n\nPelosi told a weekly news conference she expected the bill would have strong support from House Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe United States surpassed China and Italy on Thursday as the country with the most coronavirus cases, according to a Reuters tally. The number of U.S. cases passed 82,000, and the death toll reached almost 1,200.\n\nThe crisis has dealt a crushing blow to the economy, with thousands of businesses closing or cutting back. The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to 3.28 million, the highest level ever.\n\nPelosi said there was no question more money would be needed to fight the coronavirus. She said House committees would work on the next phase in the near term, even if the full chamber is not in session.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy also backs the relief plan. But he wants it to be allowed to work before deciding on more legislation.\n\n\"This will be probably the largest bill anybody in Congress has ever voted for,\" he told reporters. McCarthy predicted the measure would pass on Friday morning.\n\nThe $2.2 trillion bill follows two others that became law this month. The money at stake amounts to nearly half of the total $4.7 trillion the federal government spends annually.\n\nPelosi said House leaders planned to fast-track the rescue plan by passing it via a voice vote on Friday.\n\nThere could be opposition. Republican Representative Thomas Massie said he opposed the bill, and was uncomfortable with the idea of allowing it to pass on a voice vote, rather than recording how each House member voted.\n\n\"I'm having a real hard time with this,\" Massie, an outspoken fiscal conservative, said on 55KRC talk radio in Cincinnati.\n\nHouse leaders said late on Thursday that an unnamed House Republican might suggest a quorum is not present on Friday morning and call for a recorded vote for final passage. Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer encouraged members to be at the Capitol by 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) on Friday.\n\n\"We will see if the bill can pass by voice vote or if a Republican forces a recorded vote,\" Hoyer's office said in a statement.\n\nThe House has 430 members, most of whom have been out of Washington since March 14.\n\nIt would be difficult for all of them to return, given that two have tested positive for the respiratory disease, a handful are in self-quarantine and several states have issued stay-at-home orders. There are five vacant House seats.\n\nThe Capitol has laid out special procedures - including barring members from sitting beside one another - to minimize the threat of infection, both to members and staff.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Friday after a historic three-day run-up, with indexes poised to close the month and quarter with starkly negative performances, while the dollar was on track for its biggest weekly decline in over a decade.\n\nShares on Wall Street pared losses and the dollar fell further after the U.S. House of Representatives, as expected, approved a $2.2 trillion stimulus package, the largest in U.S. history. The bill, already passed by the Senate, will now go to the president, who is expected to promptly sign it into law.\n\nThe weakening in the dollar was seen partly as a sign that central bankers have been successful in easing stress in the money markets.\n\nThe market volatility is expected to continue as the coronavirus pandemic that triggered closures in economies worldwide remains very much a threat.\n\nThe United States surpassed two grim milestones on Thursday as virus-related deaths soared past 1,000 and it become the world leader in confirmed cases. Worldwide, confirmed cases rose above 551,000 with nearly 25,000 deaths.\n\nThe stimulus \"is not necessarily enough to make people say, 'I've got to run out and buy stocks,'\" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey. \"That's going to take more time.\"\n\nThe uncertainty over the overall human and economic toll was reflected in financial markets. MSCI's gauge of global stocks was on track to post both its largest weekly percentage gain since 2008 and its largest monthly and quarterly drops since 2008.\n\nThe infection rate for the coronavirus is driving much of the market at a time of great uncertainty, said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone Financial Inc in New York.\n\n\"My big hang-up here is when the curve does start to flatten, that doesn't mean we can return to normal human and economic behavior,\" he said. \"If we do return to normal human and economic behavior, we risk the chance the curve goes parabolic again. Just from the perspective of how long this potentially can last, there's still a great deal of uncertainty.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 602.06 points, or 2.67%, to 21,950.11, the S&P 500 lost 56.88 points, or 2.16%, to 2,573.19 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 169.11 points, or 2.17%, to 7,628.43.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 3.26%, and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.56%. Emerging market stocks lost 0.90%.\n\nStock markets have rallied over the past week on trillions of dollars of enacted and pledged economic stimulus by policymakers worldwide, from central banks to governments. Policymakers may need to offer more stimulus as the virus slams the brakes on economic activity and increases healthcare spending.\n\n\"Next week, markets will likely continue to focus on the spread of COVID-19 - whether European cases are reaching a peak, how much of the U.S. will be put in lockdown, and whether China can avoid a second wave,\" said Ga\u00e9tan Peroux, strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nThe $2.2 trillion stimulus package passed by the U.S. Congress will flood the world's largest economy with money to stem the economic damage from the pandemic.\n\nAmid the avalanche of stimulus, the U.S. dollar extended its daily decline and remained on track for its biggest weekly decline since early 2009. The dollar index fell 0.753% on Friday.\n\nThe euro was up 0.63% to $1.1098, the Japanese yen strengthened 1.59% versus the greenback at 107.90 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2432, up 1.89% on the day.\n\nThe U.S. currency's fall after two weeks of steep gains suggests the Federal Reserve's efforts to relieve a crunch in the dollar funding market are working, some analysts said.\n\n\"What we are seeing is abating stress in the money markets. Action by central banks has been successful so far and a shortage of dollars has been taken off the table,\" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and EM research at Commerzbank.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields were headed for a weekly decline, though the range of trading was far less volatile than in the previous two sessions.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes last rose 21/32 in price to yield 0.7424%, from 0.808% late on Thursday. The 30-year bond last rose 1-26/32 in price to yield 1.3291% from 1.395%.\n\nOil prices continued their fall on demand concerns as the virus slowed economies to a crawl, which outweighed the stimulus efforts. U.S. crude recently fell 4.07% to $21.68 per barrel and Brent was recently at $24.98, down 5.16% on the day.\n\nGold market participants remained concerned about a supply squeeze after a sharp divergence between prices in London and New York. The virus has grounded planes used to transport gold and closed precious metal refineries.\n\nSpot gold dropped 0.8% to $1,615.92 an ounce. The metal was on track to post its largest weekly advance since 2008.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity benchmarks rose on Monday despite a drop in oil prices to their lowest levels since 2002, as central banks and the United States tried to contain damage from the rapidly spreading coronavirus that has upended the global economy.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday extended the government's stay-at-home guidelines until the end of April, dropping a sharply criticized plan to get the economy up and running by mid-April after a top medical adviser said more than 100,000 Americans could die from the outbreak.\n\nJPMorgan now predicts that global gross domestic product (GDP) - the total monetary value of all goods and services produced - could contract at a 10.5% annualized rate in the first half of the year. As a result, central banks have mounted an all-out effort to bolster activity with interest rate cuts and massive asset-buying campaigns, which have at least eased liquidity strains in markets.\n\nChina on Monday became the latest to add stimulus, with a cut of 20 basis points to a key reverse repo rate, the largest in nearly five years.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.13% following broad gains in Europe and declines in Asia.\n\nIn midday trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 401.95 points, or 1.86%, to 22,038.73, the S&P 500 gained 55.27 points, or 2.17%, to 2,596.74 and the Nasdaq Composite added 190.13 points, or 2.53%, to 7,692.51.\n\n\"I have been in this business almost 30 years and this is the fastest correction I have seen,\" Swiss private bank Lombard Odier's chief investment officer, Stephane Monier, said of this year's plunge in global markets.\n\nIn oil markets, Brent futures were down 8%, or $2, at $22.50 a barrel - their lowest in 18 years. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell as far as $19.92, near a 2002 low hit this month.\n\nInvestors continued to seek the perceived safety of bonds, with bond yields falling in Europe and in the United States. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 31/32 in price to yield 0.6477%, from 0.744% late on Friday.\n\nThe drop in yields has combined with efforts by the Federal Reserve to pump more U.S. dollars into markets, dragging the dollar off recent highs.\n\nRodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank (NAB), said the main question for markets was whether all the stimulus would be enough to help the global economy withstand the shock from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"To answer this question, one needs to know the magnitude of the containment measures and for how long they will be implemented,\" he added.\n\n\"This is the big unknown, and it suggests markets are likely to remain volatile until this uncertainty is resolved.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

global equity markets marched higher on Wednesday and were poised for a second day of gains following a coronavirus-induced selloff, though investors remained concerned about the pandemic's economic impact.\n\nHopes that an incoming $2 trillion U.S. fiscal stimulus will ease the economic devastation caused by virus lockdowns lifted world equity indexes .MIWD00000PUS for a second day after historic gains on Tuesday, but investors refrained from calling a bottom.\n\nEurope's main markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris were struggling to stay positive after ripping 4%-5% higher and oil prices swung from 3% up to 3% down. Wall Street also teetered though it mostly remained more than 1% higher.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI soared more than 11% on Tuesday in its biggest single-day percentage gain since 1933 and the benchmark S&P 500 jumped 9.4% - its tenth best day on record out of 24,067 trading sessions since a daily data series started in 1927.\n\nThe stimulus package marks progress but the devil's in the details, said Ron Temple, head of U.S. equity at Lazard Asset Management in New York. The legislation is not available to read to know how it will be executed or when money arrives at households and small businesses gain access to funding, he said.\n\n\"This is not the all-clear, it's just material progress,\" Temple said.\n\n\"Until we know we can go back to work safely, that we can go to restaurants and go to stores and engage with other humans in close proximity, I don't think you can make an economic or a market call. It's premature to be trying to call the bottom.\"\n\nThe stimulus includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount for direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to millions of U.S. families.\n\nIt will also include $350 billion for small-business loans, $250 billion for expanded unemployment aid and at least $100 billion for hospitals and related health systems.\n\nU.S. senators will vote Wednesday. Top aides to Republican President Donald Trump and senior Republican and Democrat senators agreed on the unprecedented bill, which amounts to nearly half the $4.7 trillion the U.S. government spends annually, after five days of marathon talks.\n\nData pointed to a fast-slowing economy that analysts said signaled the United States already was in recession.\n\nNew orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell sharply in February as demand for machinery and other products slumped, suggesting a deepening contraction in business investment.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 is still nearly $8 trillion below its mid-February high, and investors expect more sharp swings. Wall Street's fear gauge eased overnight but was on the rise again ahead of Wednesday's open.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS surged 2.65% and emerging market stocks rose 4.32%.\n\nIn the currency markets, the dollar slipped for a third straight session as a scramble for liquidity was soothed by the super-sized U.S. stimulus plan, though it was starting to look a little stronger again.\n\nBond markets were also calmer. Benchmark U.S. Treasuries were yielding 0.7987% while in Europe Germany's 10-year yield DE10YT=RR edged a basis point higher to -0.296%, tailed by other higher-rated government debt. NL10YT=RR, AT10YT=RR\n\nEuropean Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde asked euro zone finance ministers during a videoconference on Tuesday to seriously consider a one-off joint debt issue of \"coronabonds\", officials told Reuters.\n\nIn metals markets, gold changed hands at $1,608.78 an ounce XAU=, retaining most of Tuesday's gains of almost 5%, its biggest jump since 2008.\n\nOil prices fell despite the massive pending U.S. economic stimulus package as the coronavirus pandemic hurt U.S. fuel demand, with traders bracing for further declines.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 was down 17 cents, or 0.6%, to $26.98 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 futures fell 21 cents, or 0.9%, to $23.80 a barrel.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Federal Reserve failed to lift global stock markets on Monday as investors continued to fret over the economic and human toll of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTraditional safe-havens like U.S. Treasuries and gold rose as investors fleeing riskier and higher-yielding assets looked for a place to park their money.\n\nThe Fed's move includes new programs that will lend against student loans, credit card loans and U.S. government backed-loans to small businesses, as well others to buy bonds of larger employers and extend them loans.\n\n\"While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions,\" the Fed said in a statement.\n\nAlthough S&P 500 futures rose sharply after the announcement, stocks traded in the red from the opening bell, dropping almost 5% at one point. The Nasdaq was recently in positive territory.\n\n\"It's their bazooka moment. It's their 'We'll do whatever it takes' moment,\" said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Troy, Michigan.\n\n\"But quite frankly the market is just in a waiting period right now until the virus runs its course and some of the therapies and other treatments are able to improve outcomes.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts said on Monday they expect global growth to dip close to global financial crisis lows and U.S. growth to drop to a 74-year low in 2020. Goldman Sachs sent a similar warning.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 267.93 points, or 1.4%, to 18,906.05, the S&P 500 lost 31.46 points, or 1.36%, to 2,273.46 and the Nasdaq Composite added 20.31 points, or 0.3%, to 6,899.82.\n\nThe Dow at one point traded below its closing level on November 8, 2016, effectively erasing all the gains since the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 4.30% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 2.27%.\n\nEmerging market stocks lost 5.38%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 5.66% lower, while Japan's Nikkei rose 2.02%.\n\nGlobally, analysts are dreading data on weekly U.S. jobless claims due on Thursday amid forecasts they could balloon by 750,000 and possibly by more than a million.\n\nThe Fed's moves put pressure on the U.S. dollar, which has risen sharply as the panic-selling drives investors toward the liquidity of the greenback and to dollar-denominated assets.\n\nThe buying continued in U.S. Treasuries, for example, and yields fell sharply.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the Fed's injections announced Monday are designed to backstop liquidity in market functioning but cannot avert the economic calamity that's already underway,\" said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.\n\n\"It really is just trying to make sure markets work and companies and municipalities can access markets when needed, but that doesn't mean layoffs aren't coming, it doesn't mean that a recession is not coming. And if you're the equity market, it's really hard to rally even on that news.\"\n\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 1-29/32 in price to yield 0.7452%, from 0.938% late on Friday. The 30-year bond last rose 4-30/32 in price to yield 1.3719%, from 1.562%.\n\nThe dollar index was little changed after falling as much as 0.84% after the Fed's announcements. The dollar fell 0.302%, with the euro up 0.69% to $1.0768.\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.42% versus the greenback at 111.23 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.1522, down 1.02% on the day.\n\nInvestors are waiting on the U.S. government to pass stimulus to support the economy.\n\n\"I think the one thing we really need to see is more fiscal ammunition coming to the fore,\" said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York. \"You've got to think about those that are asked to be socially distant and stay home from work and not earn a paycheck and they're taking their time to make them whole. They need to speed it up.\"\n\nU.S. crude recently fell 0.22% to $22.58 per barrel and Brent was recently at $26.50, down 1.78% on the day.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news",

sources", "body": "(Reuters) - Senior officials in the Trump administration agreed to new measures to restrict the global supply of chips to China's Huawei Technologies, sources familiar with the matter said, as the White House ramps up criticism of China over coronavirus.\n\nThe move comes as ties between Washington and Beijing grow more strained, with both sides trading barbs over who is to blame for the spread of the disease and an escalating tit-for-tat over the expulsion of journalists from both countries.\n\nUnder the proposed rule change, foreign companies that use U.S. chipmaking equipment would be required to obtain a U.S. license before supplying certain chips to Huawei. The Chinese telecoms company was blacklisted last year, limiting the company's suppliers.\n\nOne of the sources said the rule-change is aimed at curbing sales of chips to Huawei by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, a major producer of chips for Huawei's HiSilicon unit, as well as the world's largest contract maker.\n\nIt is unclear if President Donald Trump, who appeared to push back against the proposal last month, will sign off on the rule change. But if finalized, it could deal a blow to Huawei and TSMC, hurting U.S. companies as well, sources said.\n\n\"This is going to have a far more negative impact on U.S. companies than it will on Huawei, because Huawei will develop their own supply chain,\" trade lawyer Doug Jacobson said. \"Ultimately, Huawei will find alternatives.\"\n\nA person familiar with the matter said the U.S. government has gone to great lengths to ensure impacts on U.S. industry will be minimal.\n\nThe move could anger Beijing, which has spoken out against a global campaign by the United States to compel allies to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks over spying concerns. Huawei has denied the allegations.\n\nMost chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials, according to a report last year from China's Everbright Securities.\n\nThe equipment makers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe decision came when U.S. officials from various agencies met and agreed on Wednesday to alter the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which subjects some foreign-made goods based on U.S. technology or software to U.S. regulations, the sources said.\n\nAttendees likely included top officials from the National Security Council and the U.S. Departments of State, Defense, Energy and Commerce. None of them responded to requests for comment.\n\nHuawei declined to comment. TSMC said it \"is unable to answer hypothetical questions and does not comment on any individual customer.\"\n\nOne of the sources said the rule-change is aimed at restricting the sale of sophisticated chips to Huawei and not older, more commoditized and widely available semiconductors.\n\n\"It's impossible to tell the impact until we know the technical thresholds that may apply,\" said Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce Department official.\n\n\"Different foundries make different chips at different capabilities so you wouldn't know which foundries are affected the most until you know the technical thresholds,\" he said.\n\nU.S.-CHINA TENSIONS\n\nThe United States placed Huawei on a blacklist in May last year, citing national security concerns. The entity listing, as it is known, allowed the U.S. government to restrict sales of U.S.-made goods to the company and some more limited items made abroad that contain U.S. technology.\n\nBut under current regulations, key foreign supply chains remain beyond the reach of U.S. authorities, fueling frustration among China hawks in the administration and prompting a push to toughen up export rules for the company, Reuters reported in November.\n\nThe hawks' efforts appeared in jeopardy last month when Trump reacted strongly against the proposed crackdown, after Reuters and the Wall Street Journal reported that a move to block global chip sales to Huawei was under consideration.\n\n\"I want our companies to be allowed to do business. I mean, things are put on my desk that have nothing to do with national security, including with chipmakers and various others. So we're going to give it up, and what will happen? They'll make those chips in a different country or they'll make them in China or someplace else,\" Trump said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Huawei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Export"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200326&t=2&i=1508493149&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2P1D7", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 12458}, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 12458, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "6005670679", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-24", "time": "10:07:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-24T10:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-24T10:07:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-idUSKBN21B187", "title": "Dow soars over 11% in strongest one-day performance since 1933", "body": "(Reuters) -

Its shares have lost nearly two-thirds of their value so far in 2020.\n\nData on Monday showed U.S. business activity hit a record low in March, bolstering expert views that the economy was already in a recession.\n\nTraders were still weighing the uncertainty of the path of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"We don't know how long it's going to take to peak. We don't know how to treat it. We don't have a vaccine.

A lot of New Yorkers are going down. We don't want that,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nSince the virus first appeared in the United States in late January, Trump has vacillated between playing down the risks of infection and urging Americans to take steps to slow its spread.\n\nHe also appeared to soften his previous comments calling for the U.S. economy to be reopened by mid-April. \"We'll see what happens,\" he said.\n\nIt was not clear whether Trump would be able to block road, air and sea travel out of a region that serves as the economic engine of the eastern United States, accounting for 10 percent of the population and 12 percent of GDP.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he had no details on a possible quarantine order.\n\n\"I don't even know what that means.

The number of cases in the United States eclipsed those of China and Italy on Thursday.\n\nEven if it were possible, a New York-area lockdown might come too late for the rest of the country.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Southern California was on track to match New York City's infection figures in the next week.\n\nIn New Orleans, where Mardi Gras celebrations late last month fueled an outbreak, the number of coronavirus patients \"have been staggering,\" said Sophia Thomas, a nurse practitioner at DePaul Community Health Center.\n\nAmerican healthcare workers are appealing for more protective gear and equipment as a surge in patients pushes hospitals to their limits.\n\nOn Saturday, nurses protested outside the Jacobi Medical Center in New York, saying supervisors asked them to reuse their masks, putting their own health at risk.\n\n\"The masks are supposed to be one-time use,\" one nurse said, according to videos posted online.\n\nOne medical trainee at New York Presbyterian Hospital said they were given just one mask.\n\n\"It's not the people who are making these decisions that go into the patients' rooms,\" said the trainee, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nDoctors are also especially concerned about a shortage of ventilators, machines that help patients breathe and are widely needed for those suffering from COVID-19, the pneumonia-like respiratory ailment caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus.\n\nHospitals have also sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, oxygen tanks and trained staff.\n\nDr. Alexander Salerno of Salerno Medical Associates in northern New Jersey said he picked up masks and other equipment at an abandoned warehouse, paying $17,000 for gear that should have cost about $2,500.\n\n\"You don't get any names. You get just phone numbers to text,\" Salerno said. \"And so you agree to a term. You wire the money to a bank account.

said. \"We hide it all in drawers in front of the nurses' station.\"\n\nIn Michigan, equipment shortages could soon lead to loss of life, one emergency-room doctor warned.\n\n\"We have hospital

U.S. Treasury secretary and the Senate Democratic leader voiced confidence late on Monday for a deal to be reached soon on a far-reaching coronavirus economic stimulus package that had been stalled in the U.S. Senate as lawmakers haggled over it.\n\nNegotiators made great progress on the bipartisan, $2-trillion stimulus measure on Monday, but without striking a final pact as they had hoped, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters.\n\n\"There are still a couple of open issues,\" Mnuchin said, just before midnight. \"I think we are very hopeful that this can be closed out tomorrow.\"\n\nSchumer said he thought the Senate could vote as soon as Tuesday, adding, \"It's a huge bill of $2 trillion with many different moving parts.\"\n\nThey gave no specifics about remaining obstacles, but Democrats have said the stimulus plan originally proposed by Republicans contained too little money for states and hospitals and not enough restrictions on a fund to help big businesses.\n\nTwo attempts to advance a Republican measure in the Senate failed in the past two days, despite the party's majority.\n\nIn the second attempt, on Monday, the 49-46 vote fell short of the 60 needed to advance, as only one Democrat voted with Republicans.\n\nCongress has already passed two packages of legislation to blunt the economic toll of the pandemic, which has killed more than 550 people in the United States and sickened more than 43,800, thrown millions out of work and led state governors to order nearly a third of the nation's population to stay at home.\n\nTempers have frayed as Republicans accused Democrats of obstruction during a national emergency, even as talks continued for days.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump lashed out on Twitter just as Mnuchin and Schumer spoke, accusing Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi of taking an \"extended vacation\" and then making demands he would never agree to.\n\n\"The Democrats want the virus to win?\" Trump said in the Twitter post. \"They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies.\"\n\nDemocrats insist any agreement must include more oversight provisions for a $500 billion fund for large businesses, to avoid giving corporate leaders a blank check. Asked about that, Trump responded to reporters, \"I'll be the oversight.\"\n\nMnuchin, the Trump administration's point person on coronavirus legislation, said he would return to the Capitol at 9:30 a.m. EDT (1330 GMT) on Tuesday to resume discussions.\n\nHe told reporters Trump would like to have a deal and was hopeful it could be concluded on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration launched a major push last week for action to blunt the economic impact from the pandemic, and an accompanying steep decline in the stock market, after Trump himself spent several weeks dismissing the virus' risks.\n\nThe Senate measure includes financial aid for ordinary Americans, small businesses and critically affected industries, such as airlines.\n\nRepublicans said Democrats were seeking to add unrelated provisions, such as expanded tax credits for wind and solar power and increased leverage for labor unions.\n\nDemocrats said provisions sought by Republicans would exclude nonprofit groups from receiving small-business aid, and extend a sexual abstinence-education program due to expire in May.\n\nPelosi, who has been involved in the Senate talks, also released her own counterproposal, which would add billions of dollars to help states conduct elections by mail.\n\nRepublicans hold a slim 53-47 majority in the chamber, short of the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation. But the coronavirus has trimmed their ranks, giving Democrats more leverage.\n\nOn Sunday, Republican Senator Rand Paul said he tested positive for coronavirus. But since he kept circulating on Capitol Hill after getting tested, three other Republicans decided to self-quarantine as a precaution.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Laboratories said on Friday it won U.S. marketing approval for a diagnostic test for the coronavirus that can deliver results to patients within minutes and be used in physicians offices and urgent care clinics, as well as hospitals.\n\nThe United States now has more cases of the coronavirus than any other country, and hospitals have struggled to meet the demand to test thousands of people for the often-deadly virus.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted the approval under its Emergency Use Authorization.\n\nAbbott said in a statement that it plans to begin distributing the test next week and will ramp up manufacturing to 50,000 tests per day.\n\n\"This is a significant leap forward,\" John Frels, vice president of research and development at Abbott, said in an interview with Reuters. \"You can get a positive result in five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes. You can walk into a clinic and literally get results while you are there.\"\n\nThe portable test will run on Abbott's ID NOW platform.\n\nIt is the second test to be approved by the FDA that can be used directly in physicians' offices and other community healthcare settings and promptly provide results to patients. Last week, the FDA approved a test made by Cepheid that can be used at the point of care.\n\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic will be fought on multiple fronts, and a portable molecular test that offers results in minutes adds to the broad range of diagnostic solutions needed to combat this virus,\" said Robert Ford, president and chief operating officer at Abbott, in a statement.\n\nAbbott received approval last week for a high volume, automated diagnostic test that can be used in laboratories and said at the time it would immediately distribute 150,000 of the tests around the country.\n\nBetween the two platforms, Abbott said it plans to produce 5 million tests per month.\n\nThe FDA has been rushing to approve tests for the coronavirus on an emergency basis and has approved others made by companies including Roche Holding AG and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\n\nWith the expansion of testing has come a surge in confirmed cases of COVID-19. Reuters reported on Friday that the United States now has more than 100,000 cases.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abbott Laboratories"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Use_Authorization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency Use Authorization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-of-care_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point-of-care testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermo_Fisher_Scientific", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermo Fisher Scientific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffmann-La_Roche", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoffmann-La Roche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200328&t=2&i=1509145009&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2R00E", "eventUri": "eng-5637914", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 11905}, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 11905, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6008152535", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-26", "time": "05:15:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-26T05:15:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-26T05:14:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4823529422283173, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-jobless-idUSKBN21D0FE", "title": "Newly jobless Americans worry about making ends meet", "body": "(Reuters) - Optician Ali Nelson sent the final few orders of eyeglasses to clients last week before her Washington D.C.-based store closed to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWithout a paycheck indefinitely, Nelson is one of potentially tens of millions other Americans whose livelihoods are now in doubt because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday is set to offer the clearest evidence yet of the coronavirus' devastating impact on the economy.\n\nBehind the numbers, which are expected to hit a new record, are worried workers like Nelson.\n\nShe has already filed to receive unemployment benefits, a relatively painless process that took minutes online. But Nelson is unsure of how much money she might receive, and worries how she'll support a family of six on the amount.\n\nThe maximum offered in the District of Columbia - just about $450 a week - won't be enough to cover her rent in Fairfax County, Virginia, much less health insurance, groceries and utilities.\n\n\"This is not sustainable,\" said Nelson, 52, the primary breadwinner in her household, which includes her veteran husband who is in school and two working kids.\n\nMany of the millions of Americans bracing for life on unemployment benefits are doing so for the first time in their lives as retail stores, movie theaters, restaurants and other small business shut their doors amid the outbreak.\n\nCongress is finalizing a stimulus bill that would boost unemployment payments by $600 a week for people affected by the virus. It could also expand access to the program for self-employed workers and freelancers, who are not typically covered by the traditional program.\n\nHow much money out-of-work Americans should get remained a stumbling block to the bill passing on Wednesday. Currently, U.S. unemployment benefits usually amount to half of a worker's previous pay, less than in most other developed countries.\n\nEven if the bill does pass this week, it is not clear when consumers will get cash. The surge in unemployment claims overwhelmed some states and led to processing delays. Payments of $1,200 per low and mid-income adult, promised by the White House, may take the tax agency months to process.\n\nThe uncertainty is leaving at least some in this newly-unemployed set of Americans increasingly anxious.\n\nScott Thomas, 34, lost his job as co-creative director for The Ride, a tour of Manhattan last week. As he jumped through hoops to file for unemployment this week, he said he had put aside his goals to vacation in Las Vegas this summer. \"I don't want to take the financial risk,\" he said.\n\nUnemployment benefits are meant to help tide workers over financially while they look for a new job. They can also help the economy rebound more quickly from a downturn by providing households with money so they can keep spending.\n\nHowever, the generosity of the U.S. program, which is administered by states, varies across the country.\n\nEach state determines the level of wages that are subject to unemployment insurance taxes as long as it's above the federal minimum of $7,000, according to a report by the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. But many states collect taxes off a low base and some states pay lower benefits, the report found.\n\nThe U.S. program offers unemployed people benefits for a shorter time and with more conditions to meet than many advanced countries, an October 2019 report from the United Nations' International Labor Office shows.\n\nThe average weekly benefit was $377 in the fourth quarter of 2019, with averages ranging from slightly above $200 in some states to more than $500 in others.\n\nFor some U.S. households with little to no savings, that may not be enough to cover their essential bills. Half of U.S. households have no emergency savings, and nearly 40% would struggle to afford an unexpected expense of $400, according to a survey here by the Federal Reserve.\n\nBlack and Hispanic workers are more likely to struggle with their monthly bills, as are people with a high school degree or less, according to the study.\n\nThe changes being considered this week, which broaden access to the program and increase payments, highlight the holes in the economic safety net, economists say.\n\n\"As important as these programs are, they're not going to be sufficient in a lot of cases,\" said Dave Cooper, senior economic analyst for the Economic Policy Institute in Washington D.C. \"Unfortunately, unemployment benefits may not be enough for some folks to pay their bills.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the benefits for workers can be low if the program is not adjusted.\n\nLouis DeAngelis, 26, worked as a bar tender in Plymouth, New Hampshire, until early last week, when the governor closed all bars and restaurants because of the virus. After applying without any problems, he found out he will receive $159 a week, or slightly less than half of his weekly income.\n\nThat won't be enough to cover the rent, said DeAngelis, who was supposed to move to a new apartment in April. For now he is now looking into staying with friends or family. The money he saved for his security deposit will likely need to be used to help pay for his phone, car payment, insurance, utilities and food.\n\n\"I'm fortunate to have some family who are willing to help,\" said DeAngelis, who also worked as a substitute teacher. \"I've got options, but a lot of folks don't.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Restaurant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_County,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fairfax County, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fairfax County, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._Upjohn_Institute_for_Employment_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "W.

Financial markets rebounded on Tuesday, with stocks and oil jumping about 4% in Europe, while the safe-haven dollar recoiled as unprecedented global stimulus efforts gained traction.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Federal Reserve's offer of unlimited bond-buying was not expected to mitigate the devastating impact of the coronavirus alone, investors hoped it would help avert a global depression with the help of other state rescue packages.\n\nThe Fed's action had not cheered Wall Street for long on Monday, with losses of 2%-3% on major indexes, but the mood improved on Tuesday, as other governments and central banks stepped in.\n\nWall Street S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq indexes were expected to bounce 4%, the main European bourses were up similar amounts and oil, gold and copper had all swung 3%-5% higher.\n\n\"Today there is a strong recovery connected to the move that the Fed has introduced this massive weapon,\" said Francois Savary, CIO of wealth manager Prime Partners, adding the Fed needed to prioritise fixing the seize-ups in funding markets.\n\n\"The key issue at the end of the day is that we need to deal with a credit markets that is completely closed. First they needed to stop this increase in bond yields... second, they needed to make sure that there is a return of liquidity in the credit then it will be equities - in that sequence.\"\n\nAlongside buying unlimited amounts of assets, the Fed will also expand its mandate to corporate and municipal bonds and backstop a series of other measures that analysts estimate will deliver $4 trillion-plus in loans to non-financial firms.\n\nThere were also signs of progress in Congress on a $2 trillion U.S. stimulus deal, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hoped was \"very close\".\n\nOther countries are unveiling their own measures. South Korea's ravaged market climbed 8.6% after the government doubled a planned economic rescue package to 100 trillion won ($80 billion).\n\nIn China, mainland stocks posted their biggest gain in three weeks with a rise of almost 3%, while Japan's Nikkei soared 7%, its biggest daily rise since February 2016.\n\nBut investors were still wary, as global coronavirus infections have topped 350,000 and China posted a rise in new infections brought in from abroad.\n\nJapan said it was postponing the Olympics, General Motors became the latest to abandon its outlook for the year , while Ford had been the latest corporate giant to have its credit rating cut to the brink of 'junk' on Monday.\n\n\"Markets are continuing to bounce up on the latest policy announcements and then sliding back down as the economic reality of the situation re-emerges,\" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said.\n\nEuro zone business activity data collapsed to a record low on Tuesday and suffered by far its biggest one-month fall since the survey began in 1998.\n\nBut government and central bank financial support helped calm nerves in bond markets, where yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries hit their lowest since 2013. Ten-year yields were at 0.8339%, from last week's peak of 1.28%.\n\nGermany's 10-year yield was up 2 basis points on the day at -0.36%, compared with a 4 bps rise before the purchasing managers index (PMI) releases, all small moves when compared to record lows hit at -0.90% earlier in March.\n\n\"I think we have reached some kind of equilibrium trading range in safe havens,\" said DZ Bank strategist Rene Albrecht.\n\n\"Given the prospect for the economic downturn and much more (debt) issuance going forward, I think the level where yields are settling down is the place for them to be.\"\n\nThe impact of the virus on the global economy is evident in a series of growth forecast downgrades and advance readings of PMIs across the world's biggest economies.\n\nGerman activity plunged to the lowest since the 2009 crisis, driven by a record services contraction, while French activity hit all-time lows. Japan posted its biggest-ever services fall.\n\n\"Economies around the world are going offline and that is devastating for economic activity, it's creating the most robust dislocation in financial markets in living memory,\" said George Boubouras, head of research at K2 Asset Management in Melbourne.\n\nHowever, the prospect of massive Fed funding pushed the greenback 0.8% lower against rivals, off three-year peaks , falling against the yen and sliding 1% versus the euro.\n\nCommodity and emerging market currencies benefited, with the Australian dollar up as much 2% to $0.59315 and well off 17-year lows.\n\nThere was less market volatility too. A gauge of expected euro-dollar swings eased below 12%, from above 14% on Monday , and a measure of U.S. equity volatility slipped to one-week lows around 55 points.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",
