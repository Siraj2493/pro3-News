"(Reuters) - The United States will begin screening efforts at three U.S. airports to detect travelers from the central Chinese city of Wuhan who may have symptoms of a new respiratory virus that so far has killed two people and infected 45 more, public health officials said on Friday.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the screening at the San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles airports would begin on Friday and focus on travelers to the United States via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan.\n\nSo far, the new virus has spread outside of China to Japan and Thailand, and CDC officials said in a conference call with reporters that they expect more cases will be reported outside of China. The risk to Americans is deemed to be low, the CDC said.\n\nDr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said the CDC will be sending about 100 additional staff to the three airports -- Los Angeles International, San Francisco International and New York's John F. Kennedy International -- to supplement existing staff at quarantine stations located at those airports.\n\nUnder the screening procedures, travelers from Wuhan will be taken to a separate area in the airport, where they will complete a questionnaire and be checked for fever. Those with symptoms will be asked additional health- and exposure-related questions, and those needing more follow-up will be referred to a designated healthcare facility for more testing.\n\nThe CDC said it may adjust screening procedures as the outbreak investigation continues.\n\nThe Chinese virus is a coronavirus, a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a highly infectious virus that originated in China in 2002 and eventually traveled to 37 countries, killing 774 people.\n\nSo far, health officials do not consider the new virus from China to be as lethal as SARS, but the investigation is evolving and much is still not known about whether the virus can spread easily from person to person.\n\n\"This is the stage of the investigation where we need to proceed cautiously and be prepared for any eventuality,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a CDC expert in respiratory diseases, said on the conference call.\n\n\"It's highly plausible\" that there will be a case in the United States, Messonnier said. \"That is why we are moving forward with this screening.\"\n\nChina health officials report that most of the patients infected with the virus have had exposure to a large market where live animals were present, suggesting the virus is new and has jumped from animals to humans.\n\nIt is still not clear how well the virus can be transmitted, but there are indications of some limited spread from person-to-person, CDC officials said.\n\nThe World Health Organization this week provided guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but antivirals are being considered.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Health authorities are concerned that a virus originating in central China could spread when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during next week's lunar new year festival, but residents said there were was little anxiety in the city at the epicenter.\n\nChinese officials are cracking down on those who spread news about the disease online, some people said.\n\nAs of Friday, two people in the city of Wuhan had died following an outbreak of pneumonia linked to a new strain of coronavirus that authorities suspect originated in a seafood market.\n\nWuhan's health authority said on Saturday that a further four people were confirmed to have the virus, bringing the total number of known cases to almost 50.\n\nTwo cases have been reported in Thailand and one in Japan, all people who had traveled from Wuhan recently.\n\nA report published by London's Imperial College said there could be as many as 1,723 infections in Wuhan city alone.\n\n\"It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported,\" said the report.\n\n\"Self-sustaining human-to-human transmission should not be ruled out.\"\n\nChinese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCurrently the World Health Organisation and Wuhan health authorities have not concluded that the virus can be passed from person to person.\n\nAccording to official statistics released on Saturday, 763 people who came in contact with victims were identified by authorities, and 98 remain under observation.\n\nThe United States and most Asian countries have stepped up screenings of travelers from Wuhan and the WHO has warned hospitals worldwide that a wider outbreak is possible.\n\nIn 2002/03, the SARS virus which originated in China killed nearly 800 people worldwide.\n\nPeople in Wuhan who spoke to Reuters said that while many are reviewing travel plans as a precaution, general anxiety over the virus is low. Businesses are operating normally in the city, which has a population of over 8 million, they said.\n\nGyms, pools, transport hubs and food markets contacted by Reuters said they had not made changes or taken extra precautions.\n\nMore than 400 million Chinese people are expected to make 3 billion trips over the new year beginning on January 24, mostly migrant workers returning to their home towns. However, many Chinese also use the holiday to go overseas.\n\nA person who works for China's official train ticketing service told Reuters on Friday that there were no additional health screening measures or temperature checks in place at Wuhan train stations.\n\nSince Wednesday, people traveling from Wuhan's Tianhe International airport have been subject to temperature tests before boarding flights, according to an official notice.\n\nTwo flight attendants staffing separate domestic flights in and out of the city said they had not received additional training or warnings about the virus.\n\nBut people who have been affected are worried.\n\n\"I look at a public handrail or food or people standing close together and it makes me feel anxious,\" said a 33-year-old woman surnamed Peng, who lives roughly one km (a half-mile) from the seafood market where the virus is suspected to have originated and says her elderly aunt was hospitalized with flu-like symptoms late last week.\n\nThe illness is not a confirmed case of coronavirus, she told Reuters by phone, but two relatives canceled plans to visit the pair for the new year.\n\nPeng declined to share her full name because hospital authorities and police have warned Wuhan residents against speaking about the virus online or to media.\n\n\"There is no holiday for me ... only worry,\" she said.\n\nOne woman, whose elderly parents have been hospitalized with flu-like conditions, said she had been ordered to take full precautions even though her parents were not confirmed to have been infected by the virus.\n\n\"I can only deliver food to the door. We can't get in, we can't see each other, and we can only talk by phone,\" she said of her visits to the hospital.\n\n\"We wear two layers of masks every day, we don't go to crowded places, and we disinfect and wash our hands.\"\n\nAs the number of new cases continues to rise, locals say authorities are cracking down on people who post online information on the virus or sick relatives.\n\nEarlier this month, state media said eight people had been \"dealt with according to law\" in cases related to sharing information about the virus on social media.\n\nTwo people told Reuters they had been ordered by police to remove social media posts. They declined to share their names.\n\nSeveral source who spoke to Reuters said admittance departments at hospitals in Wuhan were unusually busy and many people with flu symptoms were told to return home.\n\n\"People are scared,\" said Peng. \"Most people maybe have a regular flu or cold... but where is the person who takes that chance?\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news",

infected at least 40 more in China, as well as prompting a travel alert from the U.S. State Department.\n\nA man in his 30s from Kanagawa prefecture, next to Tokyo, tested positive, the health ministry said on Thursday. The man had been to the Chinese city of Wuhan, where there has been an outbreak of pneumonia believed to be caused by the new type of coronavirus, a ministry statement said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department issued a health alert update on Wednesday about travel to the Wuhan region. It referred to a Watch Level 1 Alert by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging citizens travelling in the region to avoid contact with animals, animal markets or animal products, among other precautions.\n\nThai health authorities said on Wednesday they were stepping up monitoring of passengers arriving at airports ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, when 800,000 Chinese tourists are expected to visit Thailand.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some - such as the one behind Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) - are far more severe.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has said the new Wuhan virus could spread and has warned hospitals worldwide. [L8N29J2O2]\n\nJeremy Farrar, a British-based infectious disease specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, said news of a case in Japan was \"extremely concerning\".\n\nHe warned it was possible that multiple cases with mild symptoms might be masking the true numbers of people infected, indicating that many cases may be going unreported.\n\n\"Wuhan is a major hub and with travel being a huge part of the fast-approaching Chinese New Year, the concern level must remain high,\" he said in a comment emailed to Reuters.\n\n\"It is probable that we are looking at patients being affected over a number of days from multiple animal sources and with some degree of human-to-human transmission.\" A Wuhan seafood market in particular is being investigated in connection with the infection, authorities there said on Dec. 31.\n\nThe Japanese patient returned from Wuhan this month with a fever and was hospitalised. He was released on Wednesday after the symptoms subsided, the Health Ministry statement said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts":
