It was unnecessary.\"\n\nThe sources said the National Security Council (NSC), which advises the president on security issues, ordered the classification.\"This came directly from the White House,\" one official said.\n\nThe White House insistence on secrecy at the nation's premier public health organization, which has not been previously disclosed, has put a lid on certain information - and potentially delayed the response to the crisis. COVID19, the disease caused by the virus, has killed about 30 people in the United States and infected more than 1,000 people.\n\nHHS oversees a broad range of health agencies, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which among other things is responsible for tracking cases and providing guidance nationally on the outbreaks.\n\nThe administration officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said they could not describe the interactions in the meeting room because they were classified.\n\nAn NSC spokesman did not respond to questions about the meetings at HHS. But he defended the administration's transparency across federal agencies and noted that meetings of the administration's task force on the coronavirus all are unclassified. It was not immediately clear which meetings he was referring to.\n\n\"From day one of the response to the coronavirus, NSC has insisted on the principle of radical transparency,\" said the spokesman, John Ullyot. He added that the administration \"has cut red tape and set the global standard in protecting the American people under President Trump's leadership.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the HHS, Katherine McKeogh, issued a statement that did not address questions about classified meetings. Using language that echoed the NSC's, the department said it that it agreed task-force meetings should be unclassified.\n\nCritics have hammered the Trump administration for what they see as a delayed response to coronavirus outbreaks and a lack of transparency, including sidelining experts and providing misleading or incomplete information to the public. State and local officials also have complained of being kept in the dark about essential federal response information.\n\nU.S. Vice-President Mike Pence, the administration's point person on coronavirus, vowed on March 3 to offer \"real-time information in a steady pace and be fully transparent.\" The vice president, appointed by President Donald Trump in late February, is holding regular news briefings and also has pledged to rely on expert guidance.\n\nThe meetings at HHS were held in a secure area called a \"Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility,\" or SCIF, according to the administration officials.\n\nSCIFs are usually reserved for intelligence and military operations. Ordinary cell phones and computers can't be brought into the chambers. HHS has SCIFs because theoretically it would play a major role in biowarfare or chemical attacks.\n\nA high-level former official who helped address public health outbreaks in the George W. Bush administration said \"it's not normal to classify discussions about a response to a public health crisis.\"\n\nAttendees at the meetings included HHS Secretary Alex Azar and his chief of staff Brian Harrison, the officials said. Azar and Harrison resisted the classification of the meetings, the sources said.\n\nHHS did not make Azar or Harrison available for comment.\n\nOne of the administration officials told Reuters that when complex issues about a quarantine came up, a high-ranking HHS lawyer with expertise on the issue was not admitted because he did not have the proper security clearance. His input was delayed and offered at an unclassified meeting, the official said.\n\nA fifth source familiar with the meetings said HHS staffers often weren't informed about coronavirus developments because they didn't have adequate clearance. He said he was told that the matters were classified \"because it had to do with China.\"\n\nThe coronavirus epidemic originated in China and the administration's main focus to prevent spread early on was to restrict travel by non-U.S. citizens coming from China and to authorize the quarantine of people entering the United States who may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nOne of the administration officials suggested the security clearances for meetings at HHS were imposed not to protect national security but to keep the information within a tight circle, to prevent leaks.\n\n\"It seemed to be a tool for the White House - for the NSC - to keep participation in these meetings low,\" the official said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Security clearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Azar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Azar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biological warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

The Dow plummeted a record 2,000 out of the starting gate on the day marking the current bull market's 11th year.\n\nDuring the session, the Dow came about a 10th of a percent from confirming a bear market, or 20% below its record peak.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed about 19% below its all-time high set on Feb. 19.\n\n\"It's certainly one for the history books,\" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. \"The markets are now pricing in a high probability of recession.\"\n\nPeter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, agreed.\n\n\"There's a lot of fear in the market and if the price of oil continues to move lower it's an indication that a global recession is not far away,\" Cardillo said.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index , a gauge of investor anxiety, touched its highest level since December 2008.\n\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields briefly sank to 0.318%, a record low.\n\nThe sell-off began over the weekend when an oil supply pact between Saudi Arabia and Russia collapsed and both countries vowed to hike production amid weakening global demand due to the coronavirus and signs of an economic slowdown.\n\nOil prices crashed to their lowest since the 1991 Gulf war, with Brent crude futures LCOc1 closing down 23.88% and front-month WTI falling 25.1%, sending the S&P Energy index .SPNY sliding 20.1%, its largest one-day drop on record.\n\nGlobal markets were already on edge as worldwide confirmed cases of COVID-19 surged past 110,000, causing widespread supply disruption and large-scale quarantine measures as governments scramble to contain the outbreak.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 2,013.76 points, or 7.79%, to 23,851.02, the S&P 500 .SPX

energy and interest rate-sensitive financial .SPSY stocks suffering the largest percentage losses.\n\nBoeing Co (BA.N) was the biggest drag on the Dow, tumbling 13.4% following the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) rejection of the planemaker's proposal regarding wiring systems in place on its grounded 737 MAX aircraft.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) shares fell 7.9% after data showed the company

is trying to stop Washington from persuading a German company seeking a coronavirus vaccine to move its research to the United States, prompting German politicians to insist no country should have a monopoly on any future vaccine.\n\nGerman government sources told Reuters on Sunday that the U.S. administration was looking into how it could gain access to a potential vaccine being developed by a German firm, CureVac.\n\nEarlier, the Welt am Sonntag German newspaper reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered funds to lure CureVac to the United States, and the German government was making counter-offers to tempt it to stay.\n\nResponding to the report, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, wrote on Twitter: \"The Welt story was wrong.\"\n\nA U.S. official said: \"This story is wildly overplayed ... We will continue to talk to any company that claims to be able to help. And any solution found would be shared with the world.\"\n\nA German Health Ministry spokeswoman, confirming a quote in the newspaper, said: \"The German government is very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe.\"\n\n\"In this regard, the government is in intensive exchange with the company CureVac,\" she added.\n\nWelt am Sonntag quoted an unidentified German government source as saying Trump was trying to secure the scientists' work exclusively, and would do anything to get a vaccine for the United States, \"but only for the United States.\"\n\nGerman Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told a news conference that the government's coronavirus crisis committee would discuss the CureVac case on Monday.\n\nCureVac issued a statement on Sunday, in which it said: \"The company rejects current rumors of an acquisition\".\n\nCureVac's main investor Dietmar Hopp said he was not selling and wanted CureVac to develop a coronavirus vaccine to \"help people not just regionally but in solidarity across the world.\"\n\n\"I would be glad if this could be achieved through my long-term investments out of Germany,\" he added.\n\nA German Economy Ministry spokeswoman said Berlin \"has a great interest\" in producing vaccines in Germany and Europe.\n\nShe cited Germany's foreign trade law, under which Berlin can examine takeover bids from non-EU, so-called third countries \"if national or European security interests are at stake\".\n\nFlorian von der Muelbe, CureVac's chief production officer and co-founder, told Reuters last week the company had started with a multitude of coronavirus vaccine candidates and was now selecting the two best to go into clinical trials.\n\nThe privately-held company based in Tuebingen, Germany hopes to have an experimental vaccine ready by June or July to then seek the go-ahead from regulators for testing on humans.\n\nOn its website, CureVac said CEO Daniel Menichella early this month met Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and senior representatives of pharmaceutical and biotech companies to discuss a vaccine.\n\nCureVac in 2015 and 2018 secured financial backing for development projects from its investor the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, working on shots to prevent malaria and influenza.\n\nIn the field of so-called mRNA therapeutics, CureVac competes with U.S. biotech firm Moderna and German rival BioNTech, which Pfizer (PFE.N) has identified as a potential collaboration partner.\n\nDrugs based on mRNA provide a type of genetic blueprint that can be injected into the body to instruct cells to produce the desired therapeutic proteins. That contrasts with the conventional approach of making these proteins in labs and bio-reactors.\n\nIn the case of vaccines, the mRNA prompts body cells to produce so-called antigens, the tell-tale molecules on the surface of viruses, that spur the immune system into action.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CureVac", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CureVac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welt_am_Sonntag", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Welt am Sonntag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Merkel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 13}], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-5600474", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 23538, "pinterest": 28}, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 23566, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1477418026", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-10", "time": "00:46:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-10T00:46:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-10T00:45:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN20X02D", "title": "Oil jumps 8% on stimulus hopes, spending cuts by U.S. producers", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped over 8% on Tuesday, bouncing from the biggest rout in nearly 30 years a day earlier, as the possibility of economic stimulus encouraged buying and U.S. producers slashed spending in a move that could cut output.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump pledged \"major\" steps to gird the U.S. economy against the impact of the spreading coronavirus outbreak. Japan's government said it planned to spend more than $4 billion in a second package of steps to cope with the virus.\n\nU.S. shale producers, including Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), deepened spending cuts that could reduce production.\n\n\"There was almost an immediate response from U.S. producers to cut spending that will likely result in diminished U.S. oil output in the months ahead,\" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York, noting \"The rapidity of that response helped buoy the market after Monday's collapse.\"\n\nOil plunged about 25% on Monday. It rebounded on Tuesday along with equities and other financial markets.\n\nBrent futures LCOc1 rose $2.86, or 8.3%, to settle at $37.22 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 rose $3.23, or 10.4%, to settle at $34.36.\n\n\"The oil price went up today because it went insanely down yesterday, and some bargain hunters are driving things up,\" said Bjoernar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at energy consultant Rystad, noting \"It will go down further with some days going up in between.\"\n\nBoth benchmarks plunged on Monday to their lowest since February 2016, their biggest one-day percentage declines since Jan. 17, 1991, at the outset of the first Gulf War.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Oil prices bounce back from epic trouncing on stimulus hopes - here)\n\nTrading volumes in the front-month for both contracts were well below the record highs seen on Monday, when volumes soared after Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major oil producers ended three years of cooperation to limit supply and started a price war for market share.\n\nSaudi, the world's biggest oil exporter, escalated tensions with plans to supply 12.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, well above current production levels of 9.7 million bpd, according to Saudi Aramco 2222.SE CEO Amin Nasser.\n\n\"Oil prices have managed to hold on to some gains despite Saudi Arabia's announcement to open the floodgates in April,\" Rystad's Tonhaugen said, noting \"Saudi Arabia is not bluffing and the market will feel it next month.\"\n\nWith oil erasing over a third of its value this week, OPEC members were bleeding over $500 million a day in lost revenue, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nRussian oil minister Alexander Novak said he did not rule out joint measures with OPEC to stabilize the market, adding that the next OPEC+ meeting was planned for May-June.\n\nSaudi Arabia's energy minister, however, told Reuters he did not see a need to hold an OPEC+ meeting in May-June if there was no agreement on measures to deal with the impact of the coronavirus on oil demand and prices.\n\n\"I fail to see the wisdom for holding meetings in May-June that would only demonstrate our failure in attending to what we should have done in a crisis like this and taking the necessary measures,\" Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said.\n\n\"Price wars and pandemics are nothing new to the commodity markets, but both occurring simultaneously is something we have yet to witness in our careers,\" RBC analysts said in a note.\n\nSentiment was also lifted after Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first visit to Wuhan since the coronavirus outbreak forced an unprecedented lockdown of the city of 11 million people, a sign that efforts to control the virus are working.\n\nCrude prices drew some support from this, although analysts expect global oil demand will continue to slump during the outbreak, which has spread beyond China and prompted Italy to implement a nationwide lockdown.\n\nU.S. crude oil inventories rose 6.4 million barrels last week to 453 million barrels, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday.

central bank...", "body": "NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Markets reeled on Monday, with stocks on Wall Street and the price of Brent crude tumbling more than 10%, as the Federal Reserve's second emergency rate cut in as many weeks failed to calm fears of a coronavirus-induced recession.\n\nVolatility gauges known as fear indexes spiked, with the Euro STOXX 50 in Europe surging almost 28% to an all-time high while the CBOE Market Volatility index soared 44% to a record close as stocks plunged further into bear territory.\n\nThe sell-off gathered speed at the close on Wall Street, with S&P 500 falling 12%, the Nasdaq a bit more and the Dow industrials down almost 13% on the day.\n\nSome $2.69 trillion in market value was wiped from the S&P 500 as it suffered its third-largest percentage decline. Over the past 18 days the benchmark index has lost $8.28 trillion.\n\nEven traditional safe havens cratered as fearful investors decided cash is king.\n\nPlatinum dived nearly 27% to its weakest level since 2002, while gold fell more than 5% as investors unloaded precious metals in exchange for cash as not enough buyers sparked illiquidity, especially in the U.S. Treasury market.\n\nThe S&P 500 plunged 8% at the open to trigger an automatic 15-minute trading halt on the three main U.S. stock indexes, marking the third emergency pause on Wall Street in six days. U.S. stocks furthered their decline after trading resumed.\n\nInvestors worried that the Fed action, joined by central banks in Japan, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere, may be insufficient for companies facing a sharp slide in demand. The moves were reminiscent of the sweeping steps taken more than a decade ago to staunch a meltdown of the global financial system.\n\nLower rates and increased asset purchases by the Fed will help ease tight credit markets, but the U.S. government needs to do more to address the impact of the coronavirus, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.\n\n\"The Fed did what it could; I'm not so quick to blame the Fed,\" Joy said. \"Investors are looking around hoping, praying, that there will be a big fiscal package yet to come from Washington - but getting nervous that it might not.\"\n\nThe New York Fed said it would offer an additional $500 billion in support to overnight lending markets, introducing the latest round of essentially unlimited loans meant to keep cash flowing through increasingly tight credit markets.\n\nThe U.S. Senate is under pressure to pass stimulus spending after the House of Representatives last week approved a multibillion-dollar bill.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump issued new guidelines to help fight the coronavirus, including a recommendation that people avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people, discretionary travel, and going to bars, restaurants and food courts.\n\nTrump, in remarks just before markets closed, said the new guidelines from his coronavirus task force applied for 15 days and were meant to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nFinance ministers in the euro zone said the bloc so far has deployed a fiscal boost worth 1% of its gross domestic product to help the economy withstand the pandemic and pledged to do more if needed.\n\nRate-sensitive U.S. financial stocks plunged 14.0%, leading declines among the major S&P sectors. Energy stocks tracked a 10% slump in oil prices, while technology stocks also slid 13.9%. Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp together lost nearly $300 billion in market value.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 9.14% and the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 4.86% as stock markets pared initial deeper losses in Europe. Marketsin France and Spain led the decline as the two countries joined Italy in enforcing a national lockdown.\n\nThe benchmark European index has now lost more than a third of its value since hitting a record high in mid-February, while the benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite are down about 27%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,997.1 points, or 12.93%, to 20,188.52. The S&P 500 lost 324.89 points, or 11.98%, to 2,386.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 970.28 points, or 12.32%, to 6,904.59.\n\nAlmost nothing was left unscathed. Oil, already slammed by a Saudi-instigated price war, slid to less than $30 a barrel to lows last seen in early 2016.\n\nOil futures for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, fell $3.03 to settle at $28.70 a barrel, while Brent crude futures fell $3.80 to settle at $30.05 a barrel.\n\nThere were moves in Europe to curb short-selling of stocks as bond markets weighed the risk to vulnerable countries, as well as the impact of a fiscal spending splurge on safe-haven debt.\n\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 66/32 in price to yield 0.745%.\n\nThe Fed's emergency 100-basis-point rate cut on Sunday was matched by the renewal of its quantitative easing program to increase cash in markets and more cheap U.S. dollar funding to ease a ruinous logjam in global lending markets.\n\nThere was further policy easing on Monday from the Bank of Japan in the form of a pledge to ramp up purchases of exchange-traded funds and other risky assets.\n\nNew Zealand's central bank cut rates 75 basis points to 0.25%, while the Reserve Bank of Australia pumped more money into its financial system. South Korea and Kuwait both lowered rates, while Russia and Germany were throwing together multi-billion dollar anti-crisis funds.\n\nMSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tumbled 5.2% to lows not seen since early 2017, while the Nikkei fell 2.5% as the BoJ's easing steps failed to reassure markets.\n\nU.S. and Chinese data underscored just how much economic damage the disease can cause, with official numbers in China showing the worst drops in activity on record. Industrial output plunged 13.5% and retail sales 20.5%.\n\nManufacturing activity in New York state also plunged in March by the most on record to its lowest level since 2009, offering an early glimpse of the coronavirus' damaging impact on the U.S. economy.\n\nIn Asia, Shanghai blue chips fell 4.3% overnight even as China's central bank surprised with a fresh round of liquidity injections to the financial system. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 4%.\n\nGraphic - Coronavirus pummels markets: here\n\nThe safe-haven Japanese yen jumped as concerns about the outbreak sent investors fleeing higher-risk assets.\n\nThe dollar index rose 0.176%, with the euro up 0.63% to $1.1175.\n\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 1.91% versus the greenback at 105.92 per dollar.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

plunged into a bear market and oil slumped on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump banned travel from Europe to stem the coronavirus, threatening more disruption to the world economy.\n\nWith the pandemic wreaking havoc on the daily life of millions, investors were also disappointed by the lack of broad measures in Trump's plan to fight the pathogen, prompting traders to bet on further aggressive easing by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\"He (Trump) did not announce any new concrete measures such as a large-scale payroll tax cut to buffer the economy against the impending coronavirus slowdown,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.\n\n\"That has probably disappointed markets more than anything.\"\n\nEuropean shares plummeted to their lowest in almost four years, with the benchmark STOXX 600 index falling 4.9% in early deals. Travel and leisure stocks shed 8.6%, hitting their lowest in more than 6 years.\n\nThe falls pushed the MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, into bear market territory, down 20% from its 52-week peak.\n\nThe index was down nearly 2% on the day.\n\nInvestors also rushed to safe-haven assets from bonds to gold to the yen and the Swiss franc.\n\nU.S. S&P 500 futures plummeted as much as 4.9% in Asia and last traded down 4.07 , a day after the S&P 500 lost 4.89%, leaving the index on the brink of entering bear market territory, defined as a 20% fall from a recent top.\n\nThose fears left a trail of red across many markets.\n\nJapan's Nikkei crumbled 4.4% to a trough last seen almost three years ago while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 4.7%.\n\nAustralian shares plunged 7.4% to the lowest level in more than three years while Seoul's Kospi fell 4.8% to 4-1/2-year lows with massive selling prompting a brief trade halt. Thai shares sank 8.8% to 8-year lows.\n\nTrump announced on Wednesday the United States will suspend all travel from Europe, except from Britain, to the United States for 30 days starting on Friday. However, Trump said trade will not be affected by the restrictions.\n\nHe also announced some other steps, including instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments for entities hit by the virus.\n\n\"The travel ban from Europe has definitely taken everyone by surprise,\" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia Research at ANZ in Singapore.\n\n\"Already we know the economic impact is significant, and with this additional measure on top it's just going to multiply the impact across businesses. This is something that markets had not factored in ... it's a huge near-term economic cost.\"\n\nIn the money market, traders further raised expectations of another U.S. rate cut, even after the Fed's emergency cut last week.\n\nFed fund rate futures are now pricing in a large possibility of a 1.0 percentage point cut, rather than 0.75, at a policy review on March 17-18.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) described the outbreak as a pandemic for the first time on Wednesday.\n\nThe highly infectious disease that shut down most of China for much of February is spreading rapidly in Europe and increasingly in the United States, disrupting many corners of life from education to sports, entertainment and dining.\n\nInvestors worry how much of an effect policies can have in turning around the global economy given the restrictions on daily life, travel and business.\n\nA case in point was Britain, where the FTSE stock index hit near four-year lows on Wednesday as investors doubted whether the $39 billion spending plan and the Bank of England's 0.5 percentage point rate cut announced on Wednesday would be enough to counter the shock from the outbreak.\n\nGold edged up half a percent to $1,641.71 per ounce but still stood well below Monday's high above $1,700.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 0.7442% , though it is still above a record low of 0.318% touched on Monday.\n\nThe two-year yield fell to 0.4314%, but stood well above Monday's low of 0.251%.\n\nIn commodities, oil prices were hit by an intensifying price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, on top of fears of a sharp slowdown in the global economy.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates followed Saudi Arabia in promising to raise oil output to a record high in April.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude shed 4.94% to $31.35 per barrel.\n\nCopper, seen as a gauge of global economic health because of its wide industrial use, fell to over three-year lows.\n\nIn the currency market, the dollar slid against the safe-haven yen and the Swiss franc.\n\nThe U.S. currency fell 0.8% to 103.63 yen and lost 0.14% to 0.9366 franc.\n\nThe euro traded at $1.1265, down 0.04% ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting later in the day.\n\nThe ECB is all but certain to unveil new stimulus measures, including new, ultra-cheap loans for banks to pass onto small and medium-sized firms.

financial markets on Thursday after stimulus efforts from the European Central Bank failed to calm investors alarmed by U.S. moves to restrict travel from Europe because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAn MSCI global gauge of stocks posted its largest daily percentage drop on record, as did European shares . Wall Street's Dow industrials index .DJI recorded its largest daily decline since the Black Monday crash of October 1987.\n\nThe New York Federal Reserve pumped more liquidity to banks, briefly reversing some of the day's losses. It was the third substantial increase in repo support announced by the U.S. central bank this week, a sign the Fed is taking drastic steps to inject more liquidity into the banking system as markets show signs of stress.\n\nThe U.S. dollar responded atypically, rising against numerous currencies and gold in yet another sign of financial market stress. Oil prices sank further, while traditional safe-haven assets like gold and the Japanese yen lost value against the dollar.\n\nTrading was halted for 15 minutes shortly after the open in New York after the benchmark S&P 500 stock index tumbled more than 7%. It ended down 9.5%.\n\nIn a televised address late on Wednesday that included support measures for the economy, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed restrictions on travel from Europe to the United States, shocking investors and travelers.\n\nTraders were disappointed after hoping to see broader measures to fight the spread of the virus and blunt its expected blow to economic growth.\n\n\"The economy is going to grind to a halt in the next month and the recession risk is real now,\" said Zhiwei Ren, managing director at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump said the United States would suspend all travel from Europe, except Britain and Ireland, for 30 days starting on Friday. He later said trade would not be affected by the restrictions.\n\nWorries spread far beyond stocks to companies' lines of credit and their ability to finance business activity in the short term.\n\nFear of the unknown \"is gripping markets and it's more impactful in the credit markets at the moment; liquidity has effectively evaporated,\" said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital in Columbus, Ohio. \"People are looking ahead and saying 'What's this world going to feel like when we're all working at home?'\"\n\nThe European Central Bank approved fresh stimulus measures and temporarily dropped banks' capital requirements to help the euro zone cope with the shock of the pandemic, but kept interest rates on hold, disappointing markets.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJIsank 2,352.6 points, or 9.99%, to 21,200.62, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 260.74 points, or 9.51%, to 2,480.64 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 750.25 points, or 9.43%, to 7,201.80.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 11.48% and emerging market stocks lost 6.71%.\n\nJapan's Nikkei futures NKc1 lost 10.88%.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 9.51% and was down more than 20% from its 52-week peak. The index has lost more than 26% over the last 20 sessions.\n\nThe VIX volatility index - Wall Street's \"fear gauge\" - and an equivalent measure of volatility for the Euro Stoxx 50 .V2TX hit their highest since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nFed fund rate futures <0#FF:> are now pricing in a 1.0 percentage point cut, rather than 0.75, at a policy review next week.\n\nThe euro weakened after the ECB stimulus announcement.\n\nDemand for dollars via the currency derivative markets surged to the highest levels in years in a sign that coronavirus-induced economic stress is starting to manifest itself in a broad scramble for funding in dollars.\n\n\"Dollar liquidity is king in times of crisis and that is what the blow-out in swap spreads is telling us,\" said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in London.\n\nHe said this could mark a move into the next sell-off stage, which could mean a three-week-long worldwide rout in shares and riskier bonds giving way to a rush for dollars.\n\nThe dollar index =USD rose 0.792%, with the euro EUR= up 0.08% to $1.1192.\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.09% versus the greenback at 104.76 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2585, up 0.11% on the day.\n\nThe Brazilian real BRL=, Colombian peso COP= and Mexican peso MXN= all hit historic lows versus the greenback.\n\nBitcoin plunged 28.1% amid wild volatility in cryptocurrency markets.

Discarded face masks are piling up on Hong Kong's beaches and nature trails, with environmental groups warning that the waste is posing a huge threat to marine life and wildlife habitats.\n\nMost of Hong Kong's 7.4 million people have for weeks been putting on single-use face masks every day in the hope of warding off the coronavirus, which has infected 126 people in the city and killed three of them.\n\nBut huge numbers of the masks are not disposed of properly, and have instead ended up dumped in the countryside or the sea, where marine life can mistake them for food, washing up on beaches along with the usual plastic bags and other trash.\n\nEnvironmental groups, already grappling with the flow of marine trash from mainland China and elsewhere, say the cast-off coronavirus masks have compounded the problem and also raised concern about the spread of germs.\n\n\"We only have had masks for the last six to eight weeks, in a massive volume ... we are now seeing the effect on the environment,\" said Gary Stokes, founder of the environmental group Oceans Asia.\n\nStokes cited the example of Hong Kong's isolated and uninhabited Soko islands, south of its international airport.\n\nHe said he initially found 70 discarded masks on 100 m stretch of beach and when he came back a week later, there were more than 30 new ones.\n\n\"That was quite alarming for us,\" he said.\n\nOther beaches around the city tell a similar story, he said.\n\nDensely populated Hong Kong has for years struggled to deal with plastic waste. A culture of eating out, fast food and takeaway has fueled a rising tide of single-use plastic.\n\nVery little rubbish is recycled with about 70 percent of the city's 6 million tonnes of waste a year ending up in landfill.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go to the forest and find masks littered everywhere or used masks on the beaches. It is unhygienic and dangerous,\" said Laurence McCook, head of Oceans Conservation at the World Wildlife Fund in Hong Kong.\n\nConservation groups have been organizing beach clean-ups to tackle the trash.\n\nThe masks are made of polypropylene, a type of plastic, and are not going to break down quickly, said Tracey Read, founder of the group Plastic Free Seas in Hong Kong.\n\n\"People think they're protecting themselves but it's not just about protecting yourselves, you need to protect everybody and by not throwing away the mask properly, it's very selfish.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marine life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disposable product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Environmental movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_bag", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plastic bag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microorganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Wide Fund for Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polypropylene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Luggage_and_Bags", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Luggage and Bags", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200312&t=2&i=1502062531&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2B0CQ", "eventUri": null, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}, "shares": {"facebook": 18071}, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 18071, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1477373738", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-03-09", "time": "23:42:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-09T23:42:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-09T23:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4705882370471954, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-idUSKBN20W363", "title": "Oil jumps 10%, U.S. stocks rebound after market rout", "body": "NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil and global equity markets charged back on Tuesday after the prior day's steep losses as the world's biggest economies moved to cushion the impact of the coronavirus, but stock gains in Europe failed to hold as investors remained skittish.\n\nThe price of Brent crude climbed 10% on hopes a supply cut deal could be rescued and most benchmark government bond yields rose from record lows as governments outlined broad measures to confront the epidemic's economic and human toll.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he will ask Congress for a payroll tax cut and other \"very major\" stimulus moves to ease the economic pain, but details were still forthcoming.\n\nDuring a White House meeting with health executives, Trump also said the U.S. administration intended to help airlines and the cruise line industry. He later met with Republican senators to discuss proposals for boosting the economy.\n\nJapan unveiled a second package of measures worth about $4 billion in spending, focusing on support to small and midsized firms.\n\nU.S. stocks jumped more than 3% at the open, pared gains to trade briefly negative and then roared back to close up almost 5%. Investors hoped Monday's rout marks the low of a downturn that has pushed Wall Street's major indexes close to a bear market - defined as a decline of 20% from recent peaks.\n\n\"Investors are trying put a bottom in here,\" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\n\"It seems like that yesterday was such a collection of so much bad news, it shocked the market down.

A jump in infections in Italy, Germany and Britain unsettled investors.\n\nThe major European bourses remained in bear territory. The FTSE 100 in London almost eked out a gain but closed down 0.1% as oil companies rebounded from the carnage on Monday as Saudi Arabia and Russia engaged in a price war.\n\n\"Traders are a bit nervy, the only positive news we've been getting out is probably rate cuts or tax cuts,\" said Michael Baker, an analyst at ETX Capital in London.\n\n\"We need news in terms of the actual control of the virus, which we don't seem to be having right now,\" he said.\n\nYields on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury debt more than doubled to 0.801% and those on German Bunds jumped around 20 basis points at one point as investors pared some safe-haven holdings, though they were beginning to ease again. [GVD/EUR]\n\nMany strategists and economists expect the Federal Reserve to cut U.S. interest rates to zero as part of a global move to provide strength and liquidity to the financial system.\n\nThe dollar rallied after huge losses against the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc, but analysts said it was too early to predict a floor.\n\nStocks in Asia rebounded, with Japan's Nikkei closing up 0.85% after touching its lowest level since April 2017.\n\nChina's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index traded 1.8% higher as new domestic coronavirus cases tumbled and President Xi Jinping's visit to the epicenter of the epidemic lifted sentiment.\n\nThe oil rally had the most horsepower. About half of oil's massive losses from Monday were clawed back, offering hope that markets had found a floor despite still-fragile sentiment.\n\nRussian oil minister Alexander Novak said he did not rule out joint measures with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stabilize the market.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude futures rose 8.3% to settle at $37.22 a barrel, roughly half this year's peak, reached in January. U.S. crude gained 10.4% to settle at $34.36.\n\nGold prices fell 1%, retreating from the previous session's jump above the key $1,700 level, as safe-haven demand waned a little amid speculation about global stimulus measures.\n\nU.S. gold futures settled down 0.9% at $1,660.30 an ounce.\n\nThe bond market has priced in a global recession of unknown length.

the globe bounced back on Friday led by a late rally on Wall Street, after U.S. President Donald Trump freed $50 billion to tackle the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOil prices shot higher after Trump, in the same speech, said that the United States would take advantage of the recent sharp decline in prices to fill the U.S. strategic reserves of oil \"right up to the top.\"\n\nTrump's declaration of a national emergency over the virus gave a shot to stocks which had only partly reversed the sharp decline from Thursday. Financial markets closed a week marked by anxiety over the economic effects of the fast-spreading disease.\n\n\"It's probably too premature to signal the all-clear, but we're definitely taking steps in the right directions,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. Markets had been disappointed in the initial response to the coronavirus outbreak, he said.\n\n\"These are the right steps and the market is now saying, 'OK, governments, central banks and society as a whole gets it and they're moving forward.'\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, Trump had called the now-pandemic a \"hoax\" meant to damage his presidency.\n\nVolatility is seen remaining high, with sharp moves expected in both directions and across asset classes. The S&P 500 closed up 9.3% a day after falling 9.5%. The index's weekly decline was 8.8%.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 5.27% after falling by the largest percentage on record on Thursday. Its weekly decline was 12.4%.\n\nNikkei futures NKc1 rose 5.63%.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields rose as stocks rallied and as liquidity remained scarce.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 41/32 in price to yield 0.9829%, from 0.852% late on Thursday.\n\nJustin Hoogendoorn, head of fixed income strategy and analytics at Piper Sandler in Chicago, said there were \"very little bids\" in the market.\n\n\"It really does scream volatility, scream that there's a lack of liquidity in the marketplace,\" he said.\n\nItaly, where the COVID-19 death toll shot past 1,000 people, saw its borrowing costs spike by about 73 basis points this week - the most for any week since 1994.\n\nBond yields rose across the euro zone as investors' expectations grew for fiscal stimulus in the region to combat the coronavirus pandemic. [GVD/EUR]\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 rose 4.54% to $31.73 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $34.97, up 5.27% on the day. Despite the sharp gains, oil prices posted their largest weekly drops since 2008.\n\nThe dollar extended its previous session's gains, while the yen felt the pressure of risk-on trading. Market participants said signs of dollar funding stress persist and policymakers probably need to do even more.\n\n\"Underlying concerns regarding the economic fallout from the coronavirus on credit markets broadly remain,\" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.\n\n\"It may be tempting to look for signs of a low in global stocks but with the underlying issue - the coronavirus - still unchecked, we think that is premature at this point,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Wednesday, sinking into the close of trading with renewed weakness in the stock market after the World Health Organization said the global coronavirus outbreak is now a pandemic, and as major oil producers announced plans to escalate the burgeoning price war.\n\nBrent crude settled down $1.43, or 3.8%, at $35.79 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ended down $1.38 or 4% to $32.98.\n\nRisk assets tumbled throughout the day, but accelerated losses late as the number of coronavirus cases increased and numerous countries restricted travel.\n\n\"What caused the dump in oil prices in the last minutes before the oil market close was when the stock market made new lows,\" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. \"News on the coronavirus does not seem to be inspiring demand hopes right now.\"\n\nBoth the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) slashed oil demand forecasts because of the coronavirus outbreak, as they now see demand contracting in this quarter.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced plans to boost production capacity following the collapse of coordinated output cuts by Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. The Saudi energy ministry has directed producer Saudi Aramco to raise its output capacity to 13 million from 12 million barrels per day (bpd).\n\nUAE national oil company ADNOC also said it would raise crude supply to more than 4 million bpd in April and accelerate plans to boost its output capacity to 5 million bpd, a target it previously planned to achieve by 2030.\n\n\"Saudi's shock-and-awe strategy suggests to us that to bring Russia back to the negotiating table, it is serious in causing severe price and revenue pain for all oil producers,\" UBS analysts said in a note.\n\nTrading in long-dated Brent futures contracts points to expectations that supply will continue to rise. The current Brent front month contract recently traded at more than $5 below the six-month contract, the biggest discount since January 2016.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Oil price forecasts dim after price war begins - here)\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Saudi Arabia's plans to increase production capacity were \"probably not the best option\", adding Moscow had several phone calls with OPEC and non-OPEC members, but that no partners had agreed to its proposal.\n\nOPEC said in a monthly report that it expected global demand to rise by just 60,000 bpd in 2020, a reduction of 920,000 bpd from its previous forecast.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) also said global oil demand is expected to dive by 910,000 bpd in the first quarter due to coronavirus outbreak.\n\nNumerous North American producers have announced spending cuts including Occidental Petroleum Corp, Marathon Oil Corp and Diamondback Energy Inc.\n\n\"Any reduction in spending and drilling will take time to show up in actual production figures and is unlikely to mitigate the bearish impact of a massive Saudi output increase, in case the latter does happen,\" oil brokerage PVM's Tamas Varga said.\n\nWeekly data on U.S. inventories showed little effect from the coronavirus outbreak. Crude stocks rose by 7.7 million barrels, but inventories of gasoline and diesel fell sharply, as refining runs remain at seasonally low levels. [EIA/S]\n\nPolicymakers and central banks have been taking measures to bolster their economies against disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak, the latest being the Bank of England which unexpectedly cut interest rates by half a percentage point on Wednesday.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Oil price dive turns up the heat on OPEC finances - here)\n\nA worker at Equinor's Martin Linge offshore oil and gas development has been diagnosed with the coronavirus and is being held in isolation, the Norwegian energy firm said.

Losses accelerated late in the session as the number of coronavirus cases increased and the United States weighed limits on travelers from Europe.\n\nThe World Health Organization's decision to label the outbreak a pandemic came as Britain and Italy announced multi-billion-dollar war chests to fight the disease.\n\nAlready skittish investors awaiting details on U.S. measures were unnerved by news that the White House ordered federal health officials to treat dozens of virus-related meetings as classified.\n\nGovernment experts were among people without security clearance who were excluded from interagency meetings that restricted information and hampered the U.S. response to the contagion, four Trump administration officials told Reuters.\n\nThe WHO pandemic classification added to uncertainty in the market about the global economy. For the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, the Dow entered bear market territory, defined as a 20% decline from a recent peak. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite slid almost 6% at one point, also entering bear territory on an intraday basis although those losses were pared.\n\nKim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, said the classification pushed investors over the edge.\n\n\"We woke up really worried about it. There's a wider spread, the numbers are growing,\" she said. \"I don't think anyone at this point knows the real scope of this.\"\n\nEmotions drove the sell-off amid a negative backdrop of another emergency rate cut by a major central bank, the Bank of England, said Sal Arnuk, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. He said sentiment soured further on news the White House has classified coronavirus meeting information.\n\n\"If you feel the need to embargo information, a lot of people don't like that, because that makes you think they're concerned that the numbers are getting increasingly worse, so bad that they feel they need to shield the American public from that information,\" Arnuk said.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,464.94 points, or 5.86%, to 23,553.22. The S&P 500 lost 140.85 points, or 4.89%, to 2,741.38 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 392.20 points, or 4.7%, to 7,952.05.\n\nEarlier in Europe, Tuesday's strong stock rally petered out. The BofE rate cut had investors pondering how much monetary and fiscal stimulus can dampen the epidemic's economic toll.\n\nA gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations dropped to another record low. Analysts said this suggested investors were positioning for deflation risks.\n\nBritain announced a $39 billion war chest to soften the impact of the coronavirus while Italy, the hardest hit country outside of China, said it might further tighten already draconian curbs.\n\nEuropean shares closed at a 14-month low as the benchmark STOXX 600 closed down 0.7%. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 3.64%, close to bear territory.\n\nYields on U.S. Treasury debt rose in choppy trading despite the heavy stock losses. The benchmark 10-year note yielded 0.8313%.\n\nThe escalating coronavirus outbreak also has given the Federal Reserve a tough mission of trying to judge its potential economic impact in the absence of reliable data.\n\nEconomic stimulus will take time, while in the interim the virus will spread further and more businesses suspend their financial guidance, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nUncertainty has ramped up with no sign of abating, he said.\n\n\"The volatility due to the virus and the response to the virus is at very severe levels. I don't see it really calming down until our arms are around the number of people who are affected in the U.S.,\" he said.\n\nMore than 121,500 people have been infected globally and 4,383 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements.\n\n(Graphic: Volatility is back on Wall Street - here)\n\nThe dollar resumed its decline against the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc and gold rebounded, but was well off the $1,700 level it briefly hit Monday.\n\nSterling initially fell as much as 0.4% against the dollar and 1.2% against the euro after the BoE cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points, to 0.25%.\n\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 1.00% versus the greenback at 104.61 per dollar.\n\nBenchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose 5 basis points to yield 0.804%, more than double Monday's record low yield of 0.3180%.0.8711\n\n(Graphic: Markets hit hard by coronavirus worries - here)\n\nGerman government bond yields rose after the BoE cut supported sentiment, while Italian yields -- which had shot up on worries the country with Europe's worst outbreak of the virus is sliding into a recession -- tumbled as much as 20 basis points as bets grew on ECB stimulus.\n\nOil prices fell about 4%, sinking into the close of trading on renewed weakness in the stock market and as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced plans to escalate the burgeoning price war.\n\nBrent crude fell $1.43 to $35.79 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $1.38 to settle at $32.98 a barrel.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

reached an agreement with Elliott Management that lets Jack Dorsey stay as chief executive and adds three new directors a few days after Elliott's plan to push out the social media company's chief became public.\n\nElliott's head of U.S. activism, Jesse Cohn, and private equity firm Silver Lake's co-chief executive officer Egon Durban, will join the social media site's board immediately and the company plans to appoint a third new director soon.\n\nSilver Lake also will invest $1 billion in Twitter.\n\nThe agreement brings together hedge fund Elliott, which owns a $1 billion stake in Twitter, and Silver Lake in an unusual arrangement that lets Dorsey continue to lead the company, for now, and sidestep a potentially nasty proxy contest.\n\n\"While our CEO structure is unique, so is Jack and so is this company,\" Twitter's lead independent director Patrick Pichette said in a statement.\n\nTwitter shares were up about 0.4% on a day of heavy selling on Wall Street.\n\nIn reaching the agreement with Twitter, Elliott keeps a close eye on Dorsey while also giving the company more time to formulate long-term plans and repair missteps, people familiar with Elliott's thinking said.\n\nThey added that the deal avoids a mad scramble to find an immediate replacement for Dorsey.\n\nTwitter's Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal, who was privy to the discussions, said he believed the arrangement reflected more than short-term support for Dorsey.\n\n\"This is by no means thought about as temporary. This is just getting back to work with the team and the strategy, ambitions and timeframe that we were working against before,\" he told Reuters in a phone interview.\n\n\"Egon joining should be a big indication of Silver Lake's support for the founder, the team and our strategy and ambitions,\" he said.\n\nTwitter said in its statement that it would use the Silver Lake investment to help fund a $2 billion share repurchase program.\n\nTwitter also pledged to grow daily users by 20% or more in 2020 and beyond, roughly in line with user growth in its most recent quarter and its projections that costs and expenses would increase 20% this year.\n\nThe board will also create a temporary committee to evaluate Twitter's leadership structure and CEO succession plan that will share the results publicly before the end of the year.\n\nLate last month Elliott nominated four directors to Twitter's board and was pushing to remove Dorsey, one of Silicon Valley's most prominent entrepreneurs, criticizing him for being the CEO of two publicly traded companies: Twitter and Square (SQ.N), a mobile payments company he co-founded.\n\nEach company, Elliott and other investors argued, deserves a full time CEO.\n\nInvestors had also expressed concern about Dorsey's plan to spend three to six months living in Africa this year, something he walked back last week citing \"everything happening in the world, particularly with coronavirus.\"\n\n\"We invested in Twitter because we see a significant opportunity for value creation at the company,\" Elliott's Cohn said. \"I am looking forward to working with Jack and the board to help contribute to realizing Twitter's full potential.\"\n\nCohn will now sit on three boards including online shopping company eBay, which reached an agreement with Elliott in early 2019. Devin Wenig, eBay's CEO at the time, left nine months after Elliott got a seat, citing differences with the board.\n\n2020 promises to be a big year for Twitter with people looking to the company for news about the coronavirus, the U.S. election and the planned Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nThe company has taken more aggressive steps in recent months to curtail abusive behavior and give people control over the content they see on the platform. It is also rebuilding its ads system following technical issues that hurt profits last year.\n\nDorsey told analysts in January that rolling out features at a faster pace was one of Twitter's top priorities this year, acknowledging that the company had been slow in turning ideas into products.\n\nSilver Lake sent its first tweet ever to announce the news, saying: \"Silver Lake is excited to partner with @Twitter by investing and joining the board and we look forward to working alongside @Jack and the whole team.\"\n\nTwitter is one of the few U.S. technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about 2% of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott.", "source": {"uri":

spreads globally, Trump declares U.S. emergency", "body": "WASHINGTON/GENEVA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump declared a U.S. national emergency over the quickly spreading coronavirus on Friday, opening the door to more government aid to combat a pathogen that has infected more than 138,000 people worldwide and left over 5,000 dead.\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus on everyday life deepened around the world. It was detected for the first time in several countries, with the World Health Organization (WHO) calling Europe the pandemic's current epicenter. More schools and businesses closed, the global sporting calendar was left in tatters, and people faced greater restrictions on where they could go.\n\n\"To unleash the full power of the federal government to this effort today, I am officially declaring a national emergency - two very big words,\" Trump said in remarks at the White House Rose Garden, adding that the U.S. situation could worsen and \"the next eight weeks are critical.\"\n\nTrump, whose action makes available $50 billion in federal aid to states and localities, had faced criticism from some experts for being slow and ineffective in his response to the crisis and playing down the threat.\n\nThe latest steps came two days after Trump announced travel restrictions blocking U.S. entry for most people from continental Europe. While Britain was among the countries exempted, Trump said on Friday that might change because infections there had risen \"precipitously.\"\n\nThe president, who was photographed last Saturday at his private Florida club with a Brazilian official who has tested positive for the coronavirus, said he himself likely would be tested \"fairly soon,\" a reversal of his previous stance. But Trump, 73, said he did not plan to isolate himself, noting he was suffering no symptoms.\n\nTravel bans have hammered airlines and travel companies worldwide, while financial markets have been hit by panic selling this week.\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indexes rallied more than 9% on Friday, rebounding from Wall Street's biggest daily drop since 1987. But the indexes were still about 20% below record highs hit in mid-February.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Europe now had more reported cases and deaths than the rest of world combined, apart from China, where the coronavirus originated but where new cases have slowed to a trickle. The WHO called the death toll reaching 5,000 globally \"a tragic milestone.\"\n\nThe WHO's top emergency expert, Mike Ryan, said social distancing was a \"tried and tested method\" to slow the spread of a virus but \"not a panacea\" that would stop transmission.\n\n\"Blanket travel measures in their own right will do nothing to protect an individual state,\" Ryan said.\n\nMore cultural landmarks were shuttered to try to stop the spread of the virus. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre museum and the Moulin Rouge cabaret closed their doors. The Smithsonian museums in Washington were preparing to do so on Saturday and Broadway theaters in New York went dark.\n\nThe kissing of the Blarney Stone, one of Ireland's oldest tourist traditions, was suspended.\n\nCentral banks worldwide acted to shore up money markets after cratering share prices drove a rush for cash, hitting many regional currencies and threatening a surge in short-term borrowing costs.\n\nIn China, which bore the brunt of the economic fallout from the coronavirus in the first few months of 2020, authorities late on Friday cut banks' reserve requirements for the second time this year.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve followed suit with $37 billion of Treasury bond purchases, accelerating the enhanced market liquidity measures announced on Thursday.\n\nJapan's central bank pledged to buy 200 billion yen ($1.90 billion) of five- to 10-year Japanese government bonds and also inject an additional 1.5 trillion yen in two-week loans.\n\nThe European Union proposed a 37 billion euro ($41 billion)investment initiative as part of a package to cushion the bloc's economies from the coronavirus impact.\n\nIn Italy, which after China has been hardest hit by the respiratory illness, the death toll jumped by 250 to 1,266 in the last 24 hours, authorities said. The total number of cases also rose to 17,660 from a previous 15,113, despite draconian measures to restrict the movement of people.\n\nIn the northern region of Lombardy, at the heart of Italy's coronavirus epidemic, authorities asked for even stricter steps.\n\nIn hard-hit Iran, security forces will empty the streets in cities across the country, state television reported.\n\nThe virus continued its persistent march across the globe. Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Guinea all confirmed their first cases, giving the disease a foothold in 18 countries on the African continent.\n\nKosovo, Venezuela and Kazakhstan also confirmed their first cases, and Spain declared a state of emergency.\n\nWorld leaders, sports stars and actors were among the tens of thousands of people hit by the virus. Golf's crown jewel, The Masters, England's top-flight soccer Premier League, and the Boston and London marathons joined the long list of elite sporting events to be canceled or postponed.\n\nBut sport's biggest showpiece, the Olympics, will proceed as planned, according to Tokyo organizers.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

planeload of medical supplies, including masks and respirators, has arrived in Italy from China to help it deal with its growing coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak began in China late last year but has since swept the globe. Italy is now the worst-affected nation in the world after China, with 1,016 dead and 15,113 confirmed cases since the contagion came to light there on Feb. 21.\n\nA team of nine Chinese medical staff arrived late on Thursday with some 30 tonnes of equipment on a flight organized by the Chinese Red Cross.\n\n\"In this moment of great stress, of great difficulty, we are relieved to have this arrival of supplies.

Yet the ultimate spread of the virus is so uncertain, Powell said, the Fed called off quarterly economic forecasts due this week as a futile exercise until it is clear how many people will get sick, and how long public gatherings will need to be discouraged in the name of public health.\n\n\"The economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis and it is depending on the spread of the virus ... That is not something that is knowable,\" Powell said at the end of an emergency Fed meeting held in place of the Fed's regular meeting this week.\n\nGiven the depth and uncertainty of the risks, Powell said the Fed and other central banks were acting to ensure that financial markets keep functioning around the world, and trying to limit the chance that companies, households or financial institutions are dragged down by any slump in business.\n\nTo that end the Fed included dramatic moves to keep credit flowing to businesses and families, encouraging banks to tap trillions of dollars in equity and liquid assets built up as capital buffers since the financial crisis to support people whose lives may be upended by the virus.\n\n\"The virus is having a profound effect on people across the United States and around the world,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference after cutting short-term rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and announcing at least $700 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities purchases in coming weeks.\n\n\"We really are going to use our tools to do what we need to do here,\" Powell said, adding that the Fed has gone in \"strong\" and could increase bond-buying and use other tools to support market functioning and the flow of credit, what he called the Fed's \"most important\" function.\n\nA broader set of Fed powers, including direct lending to financial firms, remains at the Fed's disposal, and Powell said the central bank would not hesitate to use them if needed.\n\n\"He sounded like (former ECB President Mario) Draghi saying he will do what it takes, and we believe him,\" Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities, wrote in an email to clients. Draghi, who stepped down as head of the ECB last year, famously pledged in 2012 to \"do whatever it takes\" to combat a crisis then threatening to tear the monetary union apart, a bold declaration that is broadly credited with saving the euro.\n\nAs governments restrict gatherings, businesses and schools close, and families begin to hunker down in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus, Fed officials will \"do what we can to ease hardship\" as economic activity slows this quarter and next, he said.\n\nPowell said he could not say how long or how big the downturn will be, but promised to keep rates where they are until Fed officials are \"confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\" The Fed will delay official economic forecasts until June, he said.\n\nThe Fed and other major foreign central banks also cut pricing on their swap lines to make it easier to provide dollars to financial institutions around the world facing stress in credit markets.\n\nThe action amounted to an implicit acknowledgement that the outbreak was bringing economic activity in the United States and abroad to a \"sudden stop,\" said Sebastian Galy, senior strategist for Nordea in Luxembourg.\n\nAnd Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Fed economist, said she thought still more help may be on the way.\n\n\"I think this is the start and not the full scope of what we're going to see,\" she said, adding that the Fed may coordinate with Treasury to launch other emergency lending tools, including one aimed to add liquidity to short-term corporate credit markets.\n\nFor more commentary, please see\n\nIn a complementary move, eight of the biggest U.S. banks, in a separate statement, said they would stop stock buybacks through the second quarter, \"consistent with our collective objective to use our significant capital and liquidity to provide maximum support to individuals, small businesses, and the broader economy through lending and other important services.\"\n\nThe virus' march across America from Washington to California to New York has closed schools, sparked runs on grocery stores, shuttered retailers, and put an end to sports events big and small, and America's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Sunday that the conditions would likely get worse before they get better.\n\nSunday's dramatic steps show \"the Fed is serious, the Fed is targeting the liquidity in the credit markets and Treasury markets and trying to make certain that they operate without dislocation,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in New York.\n\nThe Bank of Japan just said it will hold an emergency meeting Monday, instead of the March 18-19 scheduled one.\n\nDespite the central banks' support, S&P 500 index futures were trading 4.8% down. [nL1N2B80LP] The dollar dropped. U.S. crude CLc1 fell more than $1 per barrel to a session low. And U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures prices TYV1 opened more than 1 point higher.\n\nOn Sunday, the Fed took further steps to boost liquidity in the U.S. financial system.\n\nIt lowered the primary credit rate by 150 basis points to 0.25 percent in order to encourage banks to tap its emergency lending window. Depository institutions may borrow from this so-called discount window for periods as long as 90 days, pre-payable and renewable by the borrower on a daily basis, it said.\n\nThe Fed also said it would support U.S. banks that began to tap the capital and liquidity buffers they built up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and would reduce reserve requirement ratios to 0% effective on March 26.\n\n\"This action eliminates reserve requirements for thousands of depository institutions and will help to support lending to households and businesses,\" the Fed said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called the actions \"good news\" that \"makes me very happy.\"\n\nIt was the third time this month the U.S. central bank took emergency action to protect financial markets and the economy.\n\nOn March 3, it cut interest rates by a half of a percentage point and last week in the face of an accelerating market meltdown it injected cash into short-term funding markets and launched a wave of Treasury security purchases.\n\nThe Fed held Sunday's policy meeting in lieu of its scheduled meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, Powell said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007\u20132008", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200315&t=2&i=1503668694&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2E0YB", "eventUri": null, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 12802}, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 12802, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1480239247", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-12", "time": "03:29:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-12T03:29:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-12T03:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9529411792755127, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-airlines-idUSKBN20Z0FJ", "title": "Global airlines call for government aid and United warns of cuts to...", "body": "CHICAGO/PARIS (Reuters) - Airlines on Thursday appealed for urgent government financial support as U.S. carriers rushed to cut flights to Europe in the wake of new U.S. travel restrictions aimed at combating the coronavirus outbreak, while United Airlines warned of U.S. travel disruption as the virus spreads domestically.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global industry group representing airlines, called on governments to consider extending lines of credit, reducing infrastructure costs and cutting taxes.\n\nU.S. travel curbs on much of continental Europe announced by President Donald Trump on Wednesday evening deepened the sector's misery that began after the virus emerged in China late last year and reduced traffic.\n\n\"Without a lifeline from governments we will have a sectoral financial crisis piled on top of the public health emergency,\" said IATA Director-General Alexandre de Juniac.\n\nAnd with more cases emerging in the U.S., United's CEO and President told employees they expect \"the need to mobilize an effective response in more places will increase.\"\n\nUnited will continue flying its U.S.-European schedule through March 19, but in April it will only run 34 daily flights versus 63 planned initially, a spokeswoman said.\n\nStock markets battered airlines amid growing concerns about the sector's financial viability.\n\nNorwegian Air (NWC.OL) said it would cut 4,000 flights and temporarily lay off up to half of its employees due to the coronavirus outbreak, while Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it would cancel flights on eight U.S. routes to Europe after Friday.\n\nU.S. airports told the White House they expected to lose at least $3.7 billion this year - an estimate made before the latest European restrictions.\n\nThe 30-day U.S. restrictions will badly disrupt transatlantic traffic key to the earnings of major European carriers and their U.S. airline partners, analysts warned.\n\nThose routes account for 20-30% of large European operators' revenue and a majority of profit, Credit Suisse analyst Neil Glynn warned, \"highlighting the damage to revenue lines for the coming weeks and potentially well into the summer.\"\n\nGlynn added that airlines would likely be forced to make heavier cuts than the drastic capacity reductions ordered as airlines scrapped flights - first to China and then to other destinations including Italy as the virus spread.\n\nIcelandair said it would cancel some flights but pledged to continuing flying between Europe and the United States.\n\nThe U.S. curbs on travel from the 26-country Schengen Area - which excludes Britain and Ireland - are similar to restrictions on China that took effect on Feb. 1 and do not apply to U.S. residents or their immediate family.\n\nBernstein analyst Daniel Roeska predicted a \"more substantial\" earnings impact than European carriers had suffered from the earlier China flight suspensions.\n\nU.S. airlines had already cut flight schedules to Italy and will take another hit from lower demand for flights from major destinations such as France and Germany.\n\nAmong them, American Airlines could be relatively spared by its alliance with British Airways (BA) and higher share of UK traffic, while Air France-KLM partner Delta and Lufthansa ally United Airlines are likely to suffer more, analysts say.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence defended the travel curbs on Thursday, after the European Union complained they had been imposed \"unilaterally and without consultation\".\n\nThe virus has taken root in the United States after spreading from China to Italy, South Korea, Iran and elsewhere.\n\nThe global travel slump looks increasingly likely to require government aid to avoid widespread insolvencies. The European Union will publish new state-aid guidelines on Friday.\n\nGermany may extend loans and other support to airlines, a government official said on Thursday. The French government also stands ready to help Air France-KLM, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.\n\n\"There is a need for measures from many governments,\" said Norwegian pilots' union president Yngve Carlsen. \"This could lead to a total meltdown.\"\n\nScandinavian carrier SAS (SAS.ST) is in talks with the Swedish and Danish governments about potential support measures, a company spokeswoman said.\n\nEU airlines have seized on the crisis to push back on green taxes designed to help the bloc meet climate goals - including proposals to end current tax exemptions on jet fuel.\n\n\"New fiscal burdens should be postponed until the industry is back on a sound operational and financial footing,\" lobby group Airlines for Europe said.\n\nThe latest travel clampdown could make coronavirus worse than previous aviation crises including the 9/11 attacks of 2001, UK-based consultant John Strickland said.\n\n\"It's coming at the end of the northern hemisphere winter, which is a weak period for airline finances (when) they should be sowing seeds of a strong summer season by getting the bookings in,\" he said.\n\nThere were panicky European airport scenes as travelers scrambled to fly to the United States before the restrictions take effect late on March 13.\n\nThe fallout is also spreading fast from travel and tourism to aerospace and other industries.\n\nSafran (SAF.PA), the world's third-biggest aerospace group, sees a growing threat to aircraft and engine order books, Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said on Thursday, adding more cost cuts were now being drawn up.\n\nADP (ADP.PA) declined to comment on a report it was preparing to close Terminal 3 at Roissy Charles de Gaulle, the French capital's main aviation hub. Norway may close several airports, operator Avinor said.\n\nItaly announced the partial closure of Rome's main airports to commercial aviation in response to its own travel lockdown. Near-empty airports in Milan and elsewhere may follow, a government source told Reuters.\n\n(GRAPHIC: European airlines crater - here)\n\nThe travel curbs will also decimate European tourists' spending in the United States. In March 2019, European visitors accounted for 29% of arrivals and $3.4 billion in spending, the U.S. Travel Association said.\n\n\"Temporarily shutting off travel from Europe is going to exacerbate the already-heavy impact of coronavirus on the travel industry and the 15.7 million Americans whose jobs depend on travel,\" U.S. Travel Association President Roger Dow said.", "source": {"uri":

Seeking a decisive win in the Michigan primary, Joe Biden was joined onstage in Detroit on Monday by two former Democratic presidential rivals, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, in the latest sign the party establishment is lining up behind him.\n\nBiden, the former vice president, squares off against Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday in Michigan and five other states in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nA win by Biden in industrial Michigan, which is the biggest prize in Tuesday's voting, could leave Sanders and his campaign reeling.\n\nThe highly coveted support from Booker and Harris, two black U.S. senators, could give Biden even more currency with African-American voters in Michigan and elsewhere as he seeks his party's nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump in November.\n\n\"There is one man now who is ready to go to the center of the arena, who is our best shot to beat Donald Trump,\" Booker told the raucous crowd of 2,000 at a Detroit high school.\n\n\"I believe in Joe. I believe in Joe,\" Harris said. \"I know Joe. And that's why I'm supporting him.\"\n\nAs a marching band played, Biden stood arm in arm with Harris, Booker and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in a gesture of growing Democratic unity. \"Folks, look, we're going to unite Democrats, Republicans, independents of every stripe. That's what the nation needs. We've got to bring the country together,\" Biden said.\n\nOver the past nine days, Biden has powered to the lead in the contest for the Democratic nomination. A wave of endorsements by his former rivals has made him the clear standard-bearer for the Democratic Party's moderate wing, while Sanders represents the party's more liberal elements.\n\nThe scene in Detroit on Monday night was reminiscent of the day before Super Tuesday, when he was endorsed in rapid-fire fashion by former presidential rivals Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke.\n\nBooker and Harris, along with Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, are considered potential candidates to be Biden's running mate on the Democratic ticket should he secure the nomination.\n\n\"They're all capable of being president,\" Biden told NBC News in an interview on Monday, adding that it would be \"presumptuous\" for him to settle on a choice before he is the nominee.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos national poll released on Monday showed Biden was amassing widening support from Democratic voters.\n\nThe poll conducted from Friday to Monday showed that 47% of registered Democrats and independents said they would vote for Biden if their state's nominating contests were held today, up 7 points from last week.\n\nThirty percent said they would vote for Sanders, unchanged from the previous poll.\n\nBiden was apparently attracting supporters of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who bowed out of the race last week but has not endorsed Biden or Sanders.\n\nSanders held a rally on Monday in St. Louis. Missouri, Mississippi, Washington state, Idaho and North Dakota also hold nominating contests on Tuesday.\n\nSanders returned later to Michigan, where he joined a roundtable in Detroit on the coronavirus. Michigan officials said on Friday they would take steps including having clerks repeatedly sanitize voting booths to alleviate the risks of infection spreading at polling places.\n\nSanders criticized Trump for suggesting people could still go to work if they contracted the virus, saying it \"might be the stupidest advice ever made by a president of the United States.\"\n\nProtesters who appeared to support Sanders interrupted Biden's Detroit speech, unfurling a banner in protest of Biden's support of a new U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada.\n\n\"The Bernie bros are here,\" Biden told the crowd. \"Let 'em go.\"\n\nOne of the most talked-about moments of Harris' campaign was her blistering June debate attack on Biden, when she called his remarks about working with segregationist senators hurtful and questioned his 1970s opposition to school busing.\n\nBooker, too, had been deeply critical of aspects of Biden's record, including his support of a 1990s crime bill and his stance of marijuana legalization.\n\nStill, black voters have backed Biden overwhelmingly, and propelled him to big victories in South Carolina on Feb. 29 and on Super Tuesday last week. They will be crucial in Michigan, where they comprise almost 14% of the population.\n\nSanders, who drew huge crowds to weekend campaign events across Michigan, scored an upset win in the state four years ago in the Democratic primary against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. Clinton would later lose the state by a narrow margin to Trump.\n\nBut Sanders still lags well behind Biden among black voters.\n\nOn Sunday, he sought to close that gap with an endorsement from civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who said the senator's progressive agenda offered black Americans the best chance to catch up socially and economically.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType":

said on Friday that he backed a coronavirus aid package hammered out with Democrats that would provide free testing and paid sick leave for workers, raising hopes that Congress can quickly pass the multi-billion dollar legislation.\n\n\"I encourage all Republicans and Democrats to come together and VOTE YES!\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi had earlier said that the Democratic-chamber would vote on the measure, which aims to limit the economic fallout from a pandemic that has infected 138,000 people worldwide, killed more than 5,000 and shuttered schools, sports arenas, theatres and offices.\n\nThe top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy, said he believed the bill would pass the Republican-controlled Senate, given Trump's support.\n\nThe bill would provide two weeks of paid sick and family leave for those affected by the virus, according to a summary released by Pelosi's office. Democrats had initially sought to create a permanent paid sick-leave benefit for the third of U.S. workers who currently lose wages when they stay home due to illness, but Republicans said that was a dealbreaker.\n\nThe measure would expand safety-net programs that help people weather economic downturns, including low-income schoolchildren who risk losing access to free breakfast and lunch if their schools are shuttered. It would bolster unemployment aid and the \"food stamps\" program that helps 34 million low-income people buy groceries.\n\nFederal support for Medicaid would also be increased, giving states a cushion to fund the low-income health insurance program that Trump has repeatedly tried to scale back.\n\nPelosi did not say whether the bill includes the $1 trillion payroll tax cut that Trump has sought. Republicans and Democrats alike have shown little enthusiasm for that proposal.\n\nPelosi does not need Republican votes to pass the bill out of the House, but it would probably not get far in the Republican-controlled Senate without bipartisan support.\n\nThe two sides have struggled to find common ground after quickly passing an $8.3 billion bill last week to pay for vaccine research and other disease-fighting measures.\n\nTrump declared a national emergency on Friday, freeing up $50 billion in federal aid.\n\nPelosi said the House will begin work on a third emergency package after

Mnuchin has pressed for tax cuts, while Pelosi had pushed to expand safety-net spending. It does not include the $1 trillion payroll tax cut that Trump had called for.\n\nPelosi and Trump have a frosty relationship, and the two did not speak directly. \"There was no need for that,\" Pelosi said at a news conference on Friday evening.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump had accused Democrats of \"not doing what's right for the country.\"\n\nThe bill would provide two weeks of paid sick and family leave for those affected by the virus. Businesses would get a tax credit to help cover the expense.\n\nDemocrats had initially sought to create a permanent paid sick-leave benefit for the third of U.S. workers who currently lose wages when they stay home due to illness, but Republicans said that was a dealbreaker.\n\nWorkers would also be able to take up to three months of unpaid leave if they are quarantined or need to take care of sick family members.\n\nIt would expand safety-net programs that help people weather economic downturns, including home-bound seniors and low-income schoolchildren who risk losing access to free breakfast and lunch if their schools are shuttered.\n\nIt would bolster unemployment aid, and the \"food stamps\" program that helps 34 million low-income people buy groceries.\n\nSignificantly, it would suspend a new Trump administration restriction, due to kick in on April 1, that would cut off food-stamp benefits for 700,000 childless adults who are not working.\n\nFederal support for Medicaid would also be increased, giving states a cushion to fund the low-income health insurance program that Trump has repeatedly tried to scale back.\n\nPelosi said the House would begin work next week on another round of legislation to assist hard-hit industries and the broader economy. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said Trump's proposed payroll tax cut could factor in those negotiations.\n\nThe two sides struggled to find common ground after quickly passing an $8.3 billion bill last week to pay for vaccine research and other disease-fighting measures.\n\nTrump declared a national emergency on Friday, freeing up $50 billion in federal aid.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Mnuchin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steven Mnuchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 11}], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-5585002", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 10800}, "sentiment": 0.6627450980392158, "wgt": 10800, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1480169127", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-12", "time": "02:08:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-12T02:08:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-12T01:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN20Z06D", "title": "Oil falls 7% after Trump surprises with travel curbs", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude slid 7% on Thursday after President Donald Trump restricted travel to the United States from Europe as part of measures to try to halt the spread of coronavirus after the World Health Organization described the outbreak as a pandemic.\n\nA flood of cheap supply coming onto the market from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates compounded pressure on prices. The Gulf Arab producers are raising production as they go on the offensive in an oil price war with Russia.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 was down $2.57, or 7.2%, at $33.22 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate Texas crude CLc1 was down $1.48, or 4.5%, at $31.50.\n\nGlobal equities plunged and the Dow Jones index was on course for its worst performance since Wall Street's \"Black Monday\" crash of 1987 after Trump announced the travel restrictions.\n\nPrices pared losses briefly after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it would increase Treasury purchases and introduce new repo operations, but the bounce faded quickly across markets.\n\n\"Global market carnage continues as Wall Street struggles to grasp how long the global pandemic will disrupt travel, trade and daily life,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.\n\n\"Brent crude seems poised to sell off another 10% here as the demand outlook seems like it will only get worse.\"\n\nGlobal oil demand is set to contract in 2020 for the first time in more than a decade, with the International Energy Agency this week lowering its annual forecast by almost 1 million barrels per day, or 1% of global demand.\n\nDemand in the first quarter has fallen sharply on the year, mostly because of the impact of the virus on economic activity in China.\n\nBoth Brent and WTI are down about 50% from highs reached in January. They suffered their biggest one-day declines since the 1991 Gulf War on Monday after Saudi Arabia launched a price war.\n\nThe six-month Brent contango spread LCOc1-LCOc7 from May to November widened to as much as $7.31 a barrel, a level not seen since January 2015.\n\nContango is where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the price to buy it now. That encourages oil firms and traders to pump oil into storage - either on land or in tankers at sea - with an aim to sell it later at a profit.\n\nThe cost to transport oil on supertankers soared as major producers scrambled to secure vessels to ship more crude and companies looked for vessels for storage.\n\nAs top oil exporter Saudi Arabia moved quickly to boost output, Russia stuck by the decision that led last week to the collapse of its alliance with Riyadh and other producers. Moscow said that there was no point cutting output because it would likely be too little to compensate for the virus' impact on global demand.\n\nFor now, both sides are digging in for the price war, said Ehsan Khoman, head of MENA research and strategy at MUFG.\n\n\"We believe that both sides have enough financial capacity and sufficiently divergent goals to sustain the oil price war for many quarters, not months,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has already stepped up efforts to squeeze Russia's Urals oil grade out of its main markets by offering its own cheap barrels to refiners worldwide that buy Russian crude, seven oil sources said.\n\nWith demand falling sharply and output rising quickly, the market is facing a big surplus in April. Estimates for the scope of the glut vary. It could be as much as 6 million bpd, said Kirill Tachennikov, director and senior oil analyst at BCS Global Markets in Moscow.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u201320_coronavirus_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2019\u201320 coronavirus outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply and demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diesel fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketplaces", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200312&t=2&i=1501971763&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2B029", "eventUri": "eng-5586282", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 10486}, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 10486, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 2182, "page": 1, "count": 25, "pages": 88}}
