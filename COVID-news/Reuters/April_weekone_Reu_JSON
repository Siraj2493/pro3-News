Trump told reporters at the White House late on Thursday he had made no offer to cut U.S. output.\n\n\"Both Riyadh and Moscow will also be looking for participation from U.S. producers, and this may prove now to be the biggest obstacle to an agreement,\" Royal Bank of Canada analysts said in a note.\n\nTrump said he had spoken with both Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, and said he expected they would cut oil output by as much as 10 million to 15 million barrels per day (bpd).\n\nEven with the huge gains on Thursday, prices have still slumped nearly 60% this year as oil demand has plummeted due to the coronavirus pandemic slashing demand even as Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would boost output in April amid their price war, raising the prospect of a flooded market.\n\nAnalysts said even if Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to cut production by as much as 15 million bpd, that would not be enough to balance the market in face of a deep economic recession.\n\n\"The 10-15 million bpd oil production cut reportedly being brokered by President Trump is a great start, but deeper cuts will likely be needed to get through a difficult Q2,\" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp.\n\nA deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia could effectively establish a floor for WTI in the $30s, he said.\n\nWith the coronavirus pandemic worsening, the global market is facing a huge oversupply of around 25 million bpd.

9.08%.\n\nSaudi Arabia has called for an emergency meeting of oil producers, while U.S. President Donald Trump said he expected the kingdom and Russia to cut output by as much as 10 million to 15 million barrels a day. That helped U.S. crude CLc1 futures settle up 24.7%, and Brent up 21.5%, their biggest daily percentage gains on record.\n\nStill, major averages waded into negative territory multiple times before a late rally pushed stocks higher to close near session highs.\n\n\"It got beaten up so badly, you don't rally like this unless it was many people thinking this got overdone,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.\n\nA bump in prices may still not be enough to save some of the debt-laden U.S. shale companies that are on the brink of bankruptcy as demand continues to plunge due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAnalysts foresee a further decline in U.S. stocks as country-wide shutdowns to limit the spread of the virus result in a virtual halt in business activity and force companies to lay off employees and save cash.\n\nBoeing Co (BA.N), once a symbol of America's industrial might, has offered buyout and early retirement packages to employees, sending its shares down 5.68%.\n\nInvestors continue to absorb a wave of bad economic news that will continue to paint a grim picture. Initial claims for unemployment benefits last week rose to 6.65 million, exceeding the top end of economists' estimates at 5.25 million.\n\n\"Overall this is a little bit of a victory in and of the fact that it was such a bad number and the market did kind of shake it off. It is also the market preparing for a lot more bad numbers,\" said Kinahan.\n\nAs earnings season slowly begins to get underway, Walgreens (WBA.O) fell 6.30% after the drugstore retailer reported a steep decline in U.S same-store sales in the last week of March.

The hope is to work \"as quickly as possible and manufacture enough of it for us and the rest of the world in a very short timeframe.\"\n\nThe agency plans to take over manufacturing of Moderna's vaccine candidate to enable the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech to focus on testing it in larger trials.\n\nBARDA hopes to speed up the back end of the vaccine manufacturing process, which involves ensuring that they are made and packaged according to standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThere are dozens of coronavirus vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization. But it is still not clear that people develop lasting immunity to this virus, or what it will take for a vaccine to be protective.\n\n\"What you need to do is take an assessment of what the most likely candidates are and invest at risk in those,\" said Seth Berkley, chief executive of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).\n\nThe earlier you make that decision, the more likely you are to have manufacturing in place, but the less confident you are about whether the vaccine will work, Berkley said.\n\nTypically, decisions on whether to move forward with a vaccine are made after safety trials and preliminary efficacy trials have been completed.\n\nJ&J said it will begin human testing in September, with an eye toward having a vaccine ready under an emergency use authorization in early 2021.\n\nJ&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company had to start ramping up manufacturing capacity now, even before it has a signal that its experimental vaccine candidate works.\n\n\"That is the only option for us to get it on time,\" Stoffels said of the early 2021 target. J&J hopes to have data proving its vaccine works by the end of this year.\n\nJ&J has a manufacturing plant in the Netherlands that can make up to 300 million doses of vaccine, Stoffels said, but that \"absolutely will not be sufficient for the world.\"\n\nThe company is also scouting for manufacturing plants in other parts of Europe and Asia capable of making the type of vaccine the company is working on.\n\nStoffels said J&J's vaccine will be based on the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine, which has been widely used in people. The company believes it will prove safe.\n\nIn lab studies, it has produced strong neutralizing antibodies to the virus - the type needed to make a successful vaccine.\n\nIn addition to the investments in J&J and Moderna, Bright said his agency is in talks with at least two other large vaccine makers, but declined to make them public.\n\nBARDA is interested in working with a broad range of vaccine technologies and with companies that have proven track records, Bright said.\n\n\"There's a lot of risk involved in making a new vaccine, a lot of risk in going quickly,\" Bright said. \"Wherever possible, we need to understand and mitigate that risk.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_Advanced_Research_and_Development_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ebola vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200330&t=2&i=1510153423&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2T13K", "eventUri": "eng-5637210", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 16294, "pinterest": 4}, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 16298, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "6013513478", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-30", "time": "15:33:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-30T15:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-30T15:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-idUSKBN21H1LX", "title": "U.S. coronavirus death toll rises past 3,000 on deadliest day", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic climbed past 3,000 on Monday, the deadliest day yet in the country's mounting crisis, while New York cheered the arrival of a gleaming 1,000-bed U.S. Navy hospital ship as a sign of hope in the city's desperate fight.\n\nIn a grim new milestones marking the spread of the virus, total deaths across the United States hit 3,017, including at least 540 on Monday, and the reported cases climbed to more than 163,000, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nPeople in New York and New Jersey lined both sides of the Hudson River to cheer the U.S Navy ship Comfort, a converted oil tanker painted white with giant red crosses, as it sailed past the Statue of Liberty accompanied by support ships and helicopters.\n\nThe Comfort will treat non-coronavirus patients, including those who require surgery and critical care, in an effort to free up other resources to fight the virus, the Navy said.\n\n\"It's a wartime atmosphere and we all have to pull together,\" said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was among the dignitaries to greet the ship's arrival at the Midtown Manhattan pier.\n\nHospitals in the New York City area have been overrun with patients suffering from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus. Officials have appealed for volunteer healthcare workers.\n\n\"We can't take of you if we can't take care of ourselves,\" said Krystal Horchuck, a nurse with Virtua Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. \"I think a lot of us have accepted the fact that we are probably going to get this.

While the United States has ramped up testing after a series of setbacks, it still lags countries like Italy and South Korea on a per capita basis.\n\nIn California, another hard-hit state, Governor Gavin Newsom said the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations had nearly doubled over the past four days and the number of ICU patients had tripled. Officials there also appealed for medical volunteers.\n\nTo ease the pressure in New York, construction of a 68-bed field hospital began on Sunday in Manhattan's Central Park. The white tents being set up evoked a wartime feel in an island of green typically used by New Yorkers to exercise, picnic and enjoy the first signs of spring.\n\nThe makeshift facility, provided by the Mount Sinai Health System and non-profit organization Samaritan's Purse, is expected to begin accepting patients on Tuesday, de Blasio said.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of the most prominent public figures of the coronavirus crisis, told a news conference the state might have to step in to close playgrounds in the country's most populous city in order to enforce social distancing and slow the spread of the virus.\n\nCuomo and de Blasio are among a growing chorus of officials who have voiced frustration at Trump's handling of the crisis and a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment.\n\n\"I am not engaging the president in politics,\" Cuomo, a Democrat, said of Trump, a Republican. \"My only goal is to engage the president in partnership.\"\n\nFord Motor Co said on Monday it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a Michigan plant in cooperation with General Electric's healthcare unit, and can then manufacture 30,000 a month.\n\nOfficials in states hard hit by the pandemic have pleaded with the Trump administration and manufacturers to speed up production of ventilators to cope with a surge in patients struggling to breathe. On Friday, Trump said he would invoke powers under the Defense Production Act to direct manufacturers to produce ventilators.\n\nU.S. health officials are urging Americans to follow stay-at-home orders until the end of April to contain the spread of the virus, which originated in China and has infected about three-quarters of a million people around the world.\n\n\"If we do things together well - almost perfectly - we could get in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 fatalities,\" Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House's coronavirus task force, told NBC's \"Today\" show.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a White House briefing that he expected a coronavirus outbreak in the fall, as well, but he said the nation would be better prepared to respond.\n\nAuthorities in New Orleans were setting up a field hospital at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center - the same site where thousands of Hurricane Katrina refugees gathered in 2005 - to handle an expected overflow of patients.\n\nDr. Thomas Krajewski, an emergency room doctor at St. Barnard Parish hospital in New Orleans, said he had watched patients be admitted to the hospital and seem ready to get better only to get worse.\n\n\"Many of them have passed away already in a way that ... it's not normal,\" he said. \"It's not something that any of us had prepared to do. And we're kind of writing the book as we go.\"\n\nThe governors of Maryland, Virginia and Arizona issued \"stay-at-home\" orders as cases rose in those states, as did Washington, D.C.\n\nAt the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, 12 prisoners were hospitalized and several required ventilators, while 77 more showing symptoms were isolated at the facility, officials said.\n\nRenowned country and folk singer John Prine was among the latest celebrities - including several members of Congress - to come down with the virus.

The Russian Direct Investment Fund is subject to certain debt and equity-related sectoral sanctions, which would not apply to transactions for the provision of medical equipment and supplies,\" the official said.\n\nThe United States began imposing economic sanctions on Russia in 2014 to punish it for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its backing for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAdditional rounds of sanctions have since been imposed on Moscow in response to its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections and alleged involvement in the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal in Britain in 2018. Moscow denies both allegations.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said Washington agreed to purchase the medical supplies but made no mention of any company or sanctions. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said it had nothing to add beyond that statement.\n\nThe State Department on Friday did not have immediate comment on the sanctions question.\n\nTrump on Thursday described the Russian shipment as containing \"a lot of medical, high-quality stuff\" which could save a lot of lives and said he'd \"take it every day\" if he had the opportunity.\n\nBut debate over who picked up the tab persisted.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow had paid half the cost with the other half picked up by Washington, though the Trump administration official later said the United States had picked up the whole tab.\n\nOn Friday a spokesperson from the RDIF said the fund stood by its earlier statement that it had paid for half of the bill. The comments got another pushback from Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration official insisted the United States paid the entire cost of the shipment and dismissed the Russian investment fund's contention that the cost was split.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed surprise and disappointment that anyone was questioning what Moscow has cast as a sincere goodwill

slowdown.\n\nEven the loss of 701,000 jobs that Labor Department data showed for March did not completely capture the economic damage from the virus. The survey considered data only until mid-March, before widespread U.S. lockdowns put more people out of work.\n\nThe worldwide spread of the virus has forced billions of people to stay indoors and pushed entire sectors to the brink of collapse, triggering mass layoffs and dramatic steps by companies to raise cash.\n\n\"Even as investors may be bracing for some grim economic reports over the next several weeks, we got a very sober reminder of what is to come by way of today's jobs report,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.\n\nInvestors were also anxious heading into the weekend due to the possibility for \"particularly ugly\" weekend news on coronavirus case counts or new hot spots around the country, Luschini said.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed down almost 27% from its mid-February record high close, or about $7 trillion in market value, and economists have cut their forecasts for U.S. GDP, with Morgan Stanley now predicting a 38% contraction in the second quarter.\n\n\"This is not like December 2018.

Trucking companies that haul dairy products are scrambling to get enough drivers as some who fear the virus have stopped working. And sales to major dairy export markets have dried up as the food-service sector largely shuts down globally.\n\nThe dairy industry's woes signal broader problems in the global food supply chain, according to farmers, agricultural economists and food distributors. The dairy business got hit harder and earlier than other agricultural commodities because the products are highly perishable - milk can't be frozen, like meat, or stuck in a silo, like grain.\n\nOther food sectors, however, are also seeing disruptions worldwide as travel restrictions are limiting the workforce needed to plant, harvest and distribute fruits and vegetables, and a shortage of refrigerated containers and truck drivers have slowed the shipment of staples such as meat and grains in some places.\n\nLeedle could likely sell his milk if he could get it to market. Dairy products in grocery stores have been in high demand as consumers stay home during the pandemic, though panic buying may be slowing. Earlier this week, a local market told Leedle's wife she could buy only two dairy products total per shopping trip as retailers nationwide ration many high-demand products.\n\n\"It's just gut-wrenching,\" said Leedle, 36, as he stood inside his barn, with cows lowing softly as the animals were giving milk that would be funneled directly into a manure pit. \"All I can see is that line going down the drain.\"\n\nLeedle has dumped 4,700 gallons of milk from his 480 cows each day since Tuesday. The 7,500-member DFA told Reuters it has asked some other farmers in the cooperative to do the same but did not say how many.\n\nDairy cooperatives oversee milk marketing for all of their members and handle shipping logistics. Leedle said he will be paid for the milk he and other farmers are dumping, but the payments for all cooperative members will take a hit from the lost revenues.\n\nLand O'Lakes Inc., another cooperative, has also warned its members they may have to dump milk. Another cooperative, Wisconsin-based Foremost Farms USA, was even more grim.\n\n\"Now is the time to consider a little extra culling of your herds,\" the cooperative said in a March 17 letter to members. \"We believe the ability to pick up and process your milk could be compromised.\"\n\nThe cooperative, which also owns butter and cheese processing plants, said milk-dumping might also be on the horizon.\n\nThe dumping comes even as consumer demand for dairy has soared. Panic buying has left grocery store shelves nearly empty in recent weeks amid business shutdowns and quarantines nationwide. Retail purchases of milk rose nearly 53% for the week ended March 21, while butter sales surged more than 127% and cheese rose more than 84%, compared to the same period a year earlier, according to Nielsen data.\n\nGrocers have been charging consumers more, too. The average retail price of cow's milk was up 11.2% for the week ended March 21, compared to a year earlier, the Nielsen data shows.\n\nFinding enough truck drivers is part of the challenge. Agriculture groups have lobbied states to increase truck weight limits on highways to enable more food to be delivered.\n\nDean Foods Co, which has been starting some plant shifts earlier and running later, is offering $1,000 sign-on bonuses for drivers with dairy experience as it struggles to fill 74 open positions, a company spokeswoman said.\n\nAnother major problem: The sudden shift in demand from restaurants - now closing en masse - to grocery stores creates severe logistical challenges. Suppliers struggle to make the shift from wholesale packaging for restaurants to preparing retail products for stores.\n\n\"About half of U.S. consumers' food budget was spent on restaurants, and we've shut that spigot off,\" said Matt Gould, editor at trade publication Dairy & Food Market Analyst.\n\nIt would take millions of dollars, for instance, to install new equipment to switch a plant from making one type of cheese - such as barrel cheese used to make processed slices for fast-food restaurants - to producing cheddar wedges for grocers, said dairy analysts. Even switching from bagging 10 lb bulk bags of shredded cheddar for food service to 8 oz bags for retail stores would require costly new packaging robots and labeling machinery.\n\nSchreiber Foods Inc, one of the country's top dairy product manufacturers and food distributors, is cutting hours for workers at its dairy processing plants that normally supply the restaurant industry and adding staff to plants that stock the U.S. retail market, said spokesman Andrew Tobisch.\n\nAs of last week, the plants serving retail were bottlenecked.\n\n\"We've almost had too many trucks showing up at some of our plants,\" Tobisch said. \"The deliveries get backlogged and the drivers are having to wait longer and longer.\"\n\nTrucks heading to restaurants, meanwhile, are getting sent back. Sartori Cheese in Plymouth, Wisconsin, has had restaurant customers refuse shipments of food they had ordered, said president Jeff Schwager. Some restaurant customers have called, asking if they can return orders delivered weeks ago. But processors can't take the cheese back and resell it - or even donate it - because they can't ensure it has been safely handled, Schwager said.\n\nSome of Sartori's grocery retailers are telling Schwager they are closing their gourmet cheese counters with their displays of huge cheese wheels, in favor of pre-packed, grab-and-go wedges. The stores want to redeploy those cheese counter crews to stock shelves and handle other tasks, Schwager said.\n\nThat means Sartori Cheese will need far more film wrap of a different size that is now in short supply as demand skyrockets.\n\nMeat producers and fruit-and-vegetable farmers are also struggling with the shift from wholesale to retail, causing plentiful products to run short on grocery store shelves.\n\nPaul Sproule, a potato farmer in North Dakota, said processors who churn out french fries and other restaurant products have stopped buying. Most can't pivot to retail because they don't have customer-facing packaging or relationships with stores for shelf space.\n\nIn rural communities, smaller food retailers such as bakeries are starting to stock products that have been running short at grocery stories. In the farm town of Rossville, Indiana, local baker Sandra Hufford's picked up grocery products from a food distributor, including butter, cartons of cottage cheese and gallons of milk.\n\n\"They told me that they had a lot of customers not wanting to pay right now, and they needed cash-paying customers,\" said Hufford, who owns the Flour Mill Bakery.\n\nHufford stocked up her bakery's refrigerated case and posted what was available for pickup and delivery on the shop's Facebook page. Word spread. Now, customers from as far as Indianapolis - 60 miles away - are placing orders and driving out to pick up groceries.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"},

rout, but details unclear", "body": "DUBAI/MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he had brokered a deal with top crude producers Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut output and arrest an oil price rout amid the global coronavirus pandemic, though details of how cuts would work were unclear.\n\nTrump said the two nations could cut output by 10 to 15 million barrels per day (bpd) - an unprecedented amount representing 10% to 15% of global supply, and one that would require the participation of nations outside of OPEC and its allies.\n\nA senior U.S. administration official familiar with the matter said Trump would not formally ask U.S. oil companies to contribute to the production cuts, a move forbidden by U.S. antitrust legislation.\n\nRussia and Saudi Arabia have been at odds since early March, when they failed to agree on a deal curbing output as the coronavirus spread around the globe. The pandemic has worsened since, freezing economic activity and sending oil prices into a tailspin as producers confronted the prospect of a dramatic fall in demand along with a flood of unwanted oil supply.\n\n\"It's a very needed and necessary step - nothing works at $20 oil. Physically, the tap has to get turned off,\" said Brian Williams, partner at Carl Marks Advisors, a merchant banking firm.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the de facto head of OPEC, called on Thursday for an emergency meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, an informal grouping known as OPEC+, state media reported, saying it aimed to reach a fair agreement to stabilize oil markets. Trump is separately set to meet with U.S. oil industry executives on Friday.\n\nTrump said he spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday. \"I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"Trump's call to Putin has changed everything,\" one OPEC+ source said, adding that initial talk among the group was about how other large producers such as Canada and Brazil would need to join in any coordinated output cuts.\n\nJason Kenney, the premier of Alberta, Canada's primary oil-producing province, said on Thursday that Alberta was open to joining a production-cut deal, though he said, \"It's the Saudis and the Russians here who are the problem.\" Canada produces roughly 4 million barrels of oil every day.\n\nGlobal oil demand is expected to fall by about 30 million bpd in April, or about one-third of daily consumption. Some 3 billion people around the world have been put on lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus, which has sickened 1 million people worldwide and killed nearly 50,000.\n\nThe immense decline in demand sent oil prices to their lowest levels since 2002, close to $20 per barrel, hitting budgets of oil-producing nations and dealing a huge blow to the U.S. shale oil industry, which cannot compete at low prices.\n\nThe downward pressure has been exacerbated by the battle for market share between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russia rejected the Saudi proposal last month to take supply off the market in part because it has cut its own output for years while U.S. production grew to a record 13 million bpd, gobbling up market share.\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that Moscow was no longer planning to raise output and was ready to cooperate with OPEC and other producers to stabilize the market.\n\nIt was not clear when Saudi Arabia's proposed emergency OPEC meeting could be held.\n\nA meeting could represent a thaw in Saudi-Russia tensions. A senior Gulf source familiar with Saudi thinking told Reuters that Russia's opposition to its proposal to deepen output cuts was the cause of market turmoil.\n\nAt the time of the deal's collapse, OPEC and its allies were collectively cutting output by about 1.7 million bpd - making a 10-to-15 million-bpd cut a big hurdle unless it brought in other major producers.\n\nThe swift and aggressive Saudi response to the collapse of the OPEC+ deal shocked the oil industry. The kingdom slashed export prices, opened the taps to pump at maximum production and tried to sell cheaper oil to refiners that buy Russian crude.\n\nMajor global producers have already scaled back production as fuel demand has dropped precipitously and storage is rapidly filling. Brazilian state-run oil producer Petrobras has already cut output by 200,000 barrels per day, about 6 percent of its output, in response to what its chief executive called the \"worse oil industry crisis in 100 years.\"\n\nU.S.-based Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and BP Plc (BP.L) recently said they would pump less oil from shale than previously targeted.\n\nThe free-fall in prices has spurred regulators in the U.S. state of Texas, the heart of the country's oil production, to consider regulating output for the first time in nearly 50 years, while producers in neighboring Oklahoma asked state regulators also to consider cuts Thursday.\n\nRyan Sitton, one of three elected oil-and-gas regulators in Texas, spoke with Russia's Novak about a cut of 10 million bpd in global supply. \"This isn't good for anybody,\" Sitton told Reuters. \"We're talking about a destabilization of the global energy market.\"\n\nBrent oil prices rose 21% to $29.94 per barrel, having earlier risen to as high as $36.29. U.S. benchmark WTI crude settled up 25% to $25.32 a barrel.\n\nEven with Thursday's surge, Brent is still less than half its $66 closing level at the end of 2019.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Specialties", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Specialties", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-5644065", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 13874}, "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 13874, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "6016786529", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-01", "time": "23:55:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-01T23:55:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-01T23:54:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-idUSKBN21J74A", "title": "Stocks climb on oil price surge despite grim U.S. jobs data", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets climbed on Thursday on a surge in risky assets like oil, offsetting concerns over an increasing death toll from the coronavirus pandemic that is expected to push the global economy into recession.\n\nInvestors sought the safety of the U.S. dollar and government bonds.

The sharp rebound from weeks of losses came after U.S. President Donald Trump said Russia and Saudi Arabia will negotiate to end a price war that slashed prices last month by more than half. Trump said the United States has not agreed to cut its output.\n\nThe rally continued Friday, with Brent crude LCOc1 futures jumping 13.9%, or $4.17 a barrel to settle at $34.11. Brent soared as much as 47% on Thursday for its highest intraday percentage gain on record, closing up 21%. The contract ended the week 36.8% higher, the largest weekly percentage gain in the contract's history.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 rose $3.02, or 11.93% to settle at $28.34 a barrel. The contract posted a 31.8% gain on the week, also its largest on record.\n\nOPEC has scheduled a Monday emergency meeting, led by Saudi Arabia, where cuts equal to 10% of world supply - about 10 million barrels per day - could be agreed-upon.\n\n\"Grand oil bargain diplomacy clearly shifted into high gear overnight and cuts are likelier than they were until yesterday,\" said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group in Bethesda, Maryland. \"The size of cuts seems to be increasing, and the timing is accelerated.\"\n\nMoscow and Washington still have made no firm commitments on output cuts. On Friday, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were to meet separately with top producers. U.S. law forbids producers from cooperating to cut output.\n\nEven a monumental cut in world output would not reduce a glut by much due to slumping demand during the worsening coronavirus pandemic, which has already sickened more than a million people worldwide.\n\nThe head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said that even if OPEC+ cut supply by 10 million bpd, global oil stocks would build by 15 million bpd in the second quarter.\n\nTrump said on Thursday he had spoken with both Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and they had agreed to reduce supplies by 10 million to 15 million barrels per day (bpd) out of total global supply of about 100 million bpd.\n\n\"It does appear that momentum is growing for some form of output agreement,\" said analyst Harlan Matthews at Redburn Energy.\n\n\"(But) there are huge obstacles to any output agreement on this scale, and even if it were to be implemented the market would remain chronically oversupplied in the near term.\"\n\nThe Canadian province of Alberta, home to the world's third-largest oil reserves, is open to joining any potential global pact to reduce a glut of crude.\n\nMexico does not plan to cut crude production at state-owned oil company Pemex, even at its most expensive oilfields, amid a severe decline in global prices, the country's energy minister Rocio Nahle told Reuters on Friday.\n\nBy cutting output by 10 million bpd, \"the oil industry would get at least three weeks more room to prepare for hitting the wall when there are no more places to put the excess production,\" said Rystad Energy's Per Magnus Nysveen.\n\nTrump is meeting with oil company executives at the White House on Friday afternoon to discuss a historic oil-price slump threatening their businesses, brought on by the coronavirus outbreak and a Saudi-Russia price war.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

markets began the new quarter with steep losses on Wednesday as evidence mounted that the coronavirus pandemic was sending the global economy into a deep recession.\n\nTraders headed for the safety of government bonds, the dollar and gold following sharp slowdowns in manufacturing activity in Japan and Germany, one day after data showed U.S. consumer confidence fell to three-year lows. New orders for U.S.-made goods fell to an 11-year low and private payrolls fell for the first time since 2017.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe sank 3.09% following a 4.5% drop in Tokyo's Nikkei and broad declines in Europe. The index is now down about 25% for the year to date.\n\nOn Wall Street, major benchmarks were sharply lower after President Donald Trump warned late Tuesday that maintaining social distancing guidelines for the next 30 days would be a \"matter of life and death.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 973.65 points, or 4.44%, to 20,943.51, the S&P 500 lost 114.09 points, or 4.41%, to 2,470.5 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 339.52 points, or 4.41%, to 7,360.58.\n\n\"President Trump's warning about two dreadful weeks ahead and 100,000 - 240,000 deaths in the coming months is definitely putting a negative tone on the market,\" said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes. \"It is pretty risk-off out there. It is definitely a day of lower bonds yields, falling equity indexes and tin hats.\"\n\nU.S. markets ended the first quarter on Tuesday, marked by the largest quarterly fall since 1987 for the Dow Jones and the steepest for the benchmark S&P 500 since the global financial crisis. The fact it all happened in a month and from record highs made it feel all the more brutal.\n\nU.S. economic activity is likely to be \"very bad\" and the unemployment rate could rise above 10% because of efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester told CNBC.\n\nIn currency markets, the dollar's safe-haven appeal pushed it up 0.6% against a basket of major currencies.\n\n\"In my view, markets have still not fully priced in the damage from the coronavirus, with some people still talking about V-shaped recovery,\" said Masahiko Loo, portfolio manager at Alliance Bernstein in Tokyo.\n\n\"The U.S. and Europe are hit by the first wave now, but as you can see in Asia, there could be more waves from re-imported cases. Human psychology also does not quickly recover either after an experience like this.\"\n\nTraders jumped toward the perceived safety of government bonds, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 0.6238% from 0.699% late on Tuesday.\n\nCommodity markets were rougher. Brent crude fell more than 6% to $24.74 per barrel as the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia jostled over a massive oversupply of oil. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 17 cents to settle at $20.31 a barrel, after hitting a low at $19.90.\n\nCrude oil benchmarks ended the first quarter with their biggest losses in history.

Osborn, Polina Devitt and Steve Holland\n\nMOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia sent the United States medical equipment on Wednesday to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, a public relations coup for Russian President Vladimir Putin after he discussed the crisis with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump, struggling to fill shortages of ventilators and personal protective equipment, accepted Putin's offer in a phone call on Monday. A Russian military transport plane left an airfield outside Moscow and arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy airport in late afternoon on Wednesday.\n\nEmergency aid to Washington was a striking development. Usually, the United States donates supplies to embattled countries rather than accepting them. The origin of the gift was bound to revive criticism from Democrats that Trump has been too cozy with the Russian leader.\n\n\"Trump gratefully accepted this humanitarian aid,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was cited as saying by the Interfax news agency on Tuesday. Trump himself spoke enthusiastically about the Russian help after his call with Putin.\n\nA U.S. official in Washington confirmed the shipment was a direct result of Trump's phone conversation with Putin. The official said it carried 60 tons of ventilators, masks, respirators and other items.\n\nThe official said the equipment would be carefully examined to make sure it comports with the quality requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nRussia's Rossiya 24 channel on Wednesday morning showed the plane taking off from a military air base outside Moscow in darkness. Its cargo hold was filled with cardboard boxes and other packages.\n\nConfirmed U.S. coronavirus cases have surged to more than 205,000, with 4,500 deaths.\n\nIn Russia, the official tally of confirmed cases is 2,337, with 17 deaths, although some doctors there have questioned the accuracy of official data.\n\nRelations between Moscow and Washington have been strained in recent years by everything from Syria to Ukraine to U.S. election interference, something Russia denies. Trump spent two years battling a federal investigation into whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia.\n\n\"Nothing to see here. Just a Russian military aircraft landing at JFK with 60 tons of medical supplies to support America's #COVID19 response. A propaganda bonanza as our own government shrinks from America's leadership role in a global crisis,\" said Brett McGurk, a former American diplomat for Trump and former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday he and Putin discussed the virus at length. \"Russia is being hit pretty hard,\" he said.\n\nPeskov, Putin's spokesman, said Moscow hoped the United States might also be able to provide medical help to Russia if necessary when the time came.\n\n\"It is important to note that when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, the president (Putin) assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary,\" Peskov was cited as saying.\n\nPeskov complained that some U.S. officials had made it needlessly difficult to expedite the aid. He also was quoted as saying that Russia and China cooperated in a similar way because \"at a time when the current situation affects everyone without exception ... there is no alternative to working together in a spirit of partnership and mutual assistance.\"\n\nRussia has also used its military to send planeloads of aid to Italy to combat the spread of the coronavirus, exposing the European Union's failure to provide swift help to a member in crisis and handing Putin a publicity coup at home and abroad.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Ukrainian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfax", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interfax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Products and Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200331&t=2&i=1510730537&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2U29S", "eventUri": "eng-5647609", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 10352, "pinterest": 3}, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 10355, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6019962209", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-04", "time": "11:17:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-04T11:17:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-04T11:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.47843137383461, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-testing-idUSKBN21M0E5", "title": "Exclusive: Amazon in contact with coronavirus test makers for potential screenings on employees", "body": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has been in contact with the CEOs of two coronavirus test makers as it considers how to screen its staff and reduce the risk of infection at its warehouses, according to internal meeting notes seen by Reuters.\n\nThe chief executives of Abbott Laboratories and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc have told Amazon they would like to work with the e-commerce company, though the U.S. government is taking up all of their testing capacity at present, the notes said.\n\nThe company also discussed whether it could start such tests in at least one warehouse near its Seattle headquarters, the status of which was unclear. The nature of Amazon's conversations with the test makers and the exact assistance they might offer were unclear.\n\nThe document separately indicated Amazon is looking into the ability to screen more than one person at a time for the virus, and it also wants to partner with a medical organization in its testing efforts. It did not give further details on multi-person testing or name a partner.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, Abbott Laboratories confirmed it has been contacted by Amazon and other companies to provide testing for their workforces.\n\n\"We know it's important for several industries for their workforces to be safe, but as we've said, right now we've prioritized the healthcare frontline workforce in outbreak hotspots and have been working with the White House Task Force, FDA, FEMA and CDC and state authorities to ensure they get to those areas,\" said an Abbott spokesperson.\n\nThermo Fisher did not return a request for comment late Friday. Amazon declined to comment.\n\nAmazon, the world's largest online retailer, is rolling out face masks and temperature checks for workers at all its U.S. and European warehouses by next week.\n\nLonger term, however, it wants to test workers for the virus and hopes other companies will follow suit, according to the notes, in which Amazon's general counsel also criticized an employee who was fired on Monday.\n\nThe notes reveal how the company is focused on coronavirus testing as important to its operation and to bolstering the U.S. economy. They also show how Amazon remains in the early stages of determining how to start checks for the virus and tackle a shortage of tests.\n\nThe attempts to increase screening measures come at a time when high-profile protests have hit several Amazon warehouses, as employees increasingly fear they will contract the virus by showing up to work. The COVID-19 disease already has been reported among staff from at least 19 of its U.S. warehouses.\n\nMore than a million people globally have been infected and more than 58,000 have died in the pandemic.\n\nAbbott has U.S. marketing approval for a diagnostic test that can give patients results in minutes, for use in physicians' offices and other community healthcare settings. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a Thermo Fisher test as well.\n\nThe type of evaluation Amazon was considering was also unclear, whether diagnostic to detect current infections or an antibody test to tell if someone may be immune.\n\nAmazon has had a growing interest in healthcare. The company announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co two years ago to lower health costs for their employees, a venture now known as Haven.\n\nOther retailers, meanwhile, including rival Walmart Inc, have worked with the White House on drive-through testing for first responders.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"},

jobless claims blow past six million as coronavirus lockdowns spread", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits shot to a record high of more than 6 million last week as more jurisdictions enforced stay-at-home measures to curb the coronavirus pandemic, which economists say has pushed the economy into recession.\n\nThursday's weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department, the most timely data on the economy's health, reinforced economists' views that the longest employment boom in U.S. history probably ended in March. With a majority of Americans now under some form of lockdown, claims are expected to rise further.\n\nEconomists said worsening job losses underscored the need for additional fiscal and monetary stimulus. President Donald Trump last week signed a historic $2.3 trillion package, with provisions for companies and unemployed workers. The Federal Reserve has also undertaken extraordinary measures to help companies weather the highly contagious virus, which has brought the country to a halt.\n\n\"These data underscore the magnitude of the stop-work order that has been imposed on the economy,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. \"The scale of the increase should also focus policymakers on getting the cash into the economy with possibly a fourth fiscal package and additional Fed lending programs.\"\n\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits surged 3.341 million to a seasonally adjusted 6.648 million for the week ended March 28, the government said. That was double the previous all-time high of 3.307 million set in the prior week.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would jump to 3.50 million in the latest week, though estimates were as high as 5.25 million. The number of people on unemployment rolls shot up 1.245 million to 3.029 million in the week ended March 21, the highest since July 6, 2013.\n\nThe United States has the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, with more than 214,000 people infected. Nearly 5,000 people in the country have died from the illness, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nThe Labor Department said states continued to identify layoffs related to COVID-19 across a broad array of industries, including accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, manufacturing industries, retail, wholesale trade and construction industries.\n\n\"Similar to last week's unemployment claims numbers, today's report reflects the sacrifices American workers are making for their families, neighbors, and country in order to slow the spread,\" U.S. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said in a statement.\n\nThe dollar .DXY was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street gained as a recovery in oil prices outweighed the shock of the jobless claims data.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Unemployment benefits claims hit all-time high - here)\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic's disruptive impact was highlighted by a separate report from the U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday showing a collapse in Chinese imports, resulting in the U.S. trade deficit narrowing 12.2% to $39.9 billion in February, the lowest level since September 2016.\n\nWhile the shrinking trade gap is a positive in the calculation of gross domestic product, declining imports mean less inventory accumulation, which could offset the contribution to GDP. The shortages stemming from meager imports are weighing on consumer spending and production at factories, which could lead to further job losses.\n\nEconomists believe the economy slipped into recession in March. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.\n\n\"The U.S. economy is now in recession,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. \"Enormous job losses could do tremendous long-lasting damage to the economy that would weaken any eventual recovery.\"\n\nApplications for unemployment benefits peaked at 665,000 during the 2007-2009 recession, when 8.7 million jobs were lost. Unadjusted claims in California soared 692,394 last week. New York, another COVID-19 hot spot, reported an increase of 286,404.\n\nEconomists say the country should brace for jobless claims to continue escalating, partly citing generous provisions of the fiscal package and the federal government's easing of requirements for workers to seek benefits.\n\nAs a result, self-employed and gig workers who previously were unable to claim unemployment benefits are now eligible. In addition, the unemployed will get an additional $600 per week for up to four months. This is on top of existing jobless benefits, which averaged $385 per person per month in January, and is equivalent to $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.\n\nBy comparison, the government-mandated minimum wage is about $7.25 per hour. Last week's claims data has no bearing on the closely watched employment report for March, which is scheduled for release on Friday. The government surveyed businesses and households in the middle of the month for the employment report, when just a handful of states were enforcing \"stay-at-home\" or \"shelter-in-place\" orders.\n\nIt is, however, a preview of the carnage that awaits. Retailers, including Macy's (M.N), Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) and Gap Inc (GPS.N), said on Monday they would furlough tens of thousands of employees, as they prepare to keep stores shut for longer.\n\nAccording to a Reuters survey of economists, the government report on Friday is likely to show nonfarm payrolls dropped by 100,000 jobs last month after a robust increase of 273,000 in February. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise three-tenths of a percentage point to 3.8% in March.\n\n\"The broader stimulus package contains many weaknesses that reduce its effectiveness, which is regrettable because the job loss we have seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg,\" said Heidi Shierholz, a former chief economist at the Labor Department.\n\n\"Based on new GDP forecasts, we project that nearly 20 million workers will be laid off or furloughed by July, with losses in every state,\" added Shierholz, now a policy director at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.",

almost $1 trillion: PM", "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is to impose a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures as early as Tuesday to contain the coronavirus, while the government prepares a $990 billion stimulus package to soften the economic blow.\n\nDomestic infections topped 4,000, Jiji news reported, and 93 have died - not a huge outbreak compared with some global hot spots. But the numbers keep rising, with particular alarm over the spread in Tokyo, which has more than 1,000 cases including 83 new ones on Monday.\n\n\"Japan won't, and doesn't need, to take lockdown steps like those overseas,\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, citing the opinion of infectious disease experts. \"Trains will be running and supermarkets will be open. The state of emergency will allow us to strengthen current steps to prevent an increase in infections while ensuring that economic activity is sustained as much as possible,\" he said.\n\nAn emergency, which Abe said would last about a month, will give governors authority to call on people to stay at home and businesses to close. With no penalties for ignoring the requests in most cases, enforcement will rely more on peer pressure and respect for authority, and was unlikely to be as rigorous as lockdowns in many other countries.\n\nIn a sign that corporate Japan already was heeding the call, Canon Inc. (7751.T) announced it would close its Tokyo headquarters for 10 days starting from Tuesday.\n\nPressure had been mounting on the government to take the step although Abe had voiced concern about being too hasty, given the restrictions on movement and businesses it would entail.\n\nAbe also said the government will launch a stimulus package of about 108 trillion yen, including more than 6 trillion yen for cash payouts to households and small businesses and 26 trillion yen to allow deferred social security and tax payments.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how much of that package would be new government spending.\n\nAn emergency appears to have public support. In a poll published on Monday by JNN, run by broadcaster TBS, 80% of those surveyed said Abe should declare it while 12% said it was not necessary. His approval rating fell by 5.7 points from last month to 43.2%, the survey showed.\n\nBut Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute for Public Health at King's College, London, said the emergency was too late given the explosive increase in cases in Tokyo.\n\n\"It should have been declared by April 1 at the latest,\" he said.\n\nClick here for a GRAPHIC tracking the global spread of the coronavirus\n\nUnder a law revised in March to cover the coronavirus, the prime minister can declare a state of emergency if the disease poses a \"grave danger\" to lives and if its rapid spread could have a big impact on the economy.\n\nAbe must seek formal advice from a panel of experts before deciding to go ahead and declare the emergency.\n\nWhile Japan's coronavirus epidemic is dwarfed by the 335,000 infections and more than 9,500 deaths in the United States alone, experts worry a sudden surge could overwhelm Japan's medical system.\n\nSounding an alarm over the high rate of cases that could not be traced, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike indicated last week that she would favour a state of emergency as a way to help her urge residents to abide by stronger social-distancing measures.\n\nThe emergency measures are meant to reduce social activity by 80%, a critical degree to curtail infections, said Koji Wada, a member of the expert panel advising policymakers. The government must show \"guts\" in levelling with the public, with Abe being specific in his declaration about how people should conduct daily life.\n\n\"It really depends on the speech by Prime Minister Abe,\" said Wada, a professor at International University of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. \"I really expect him to tell us what kind of activities we should do.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinzo_Abe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shinzo Abe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yomiuri_Shimbun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yomiuri Shimbun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Preparedness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Emergency Preparedness", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200405&t=2&i=1512877268&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG340NH", "eventUri": "eng-5662471", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 9792}, "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 9792, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6017317633", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-02", "time": "10:16:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-02T10:16:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-02T10:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9137254953384399, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-new-orleans-idUSKBN21K1B0", "title": "Why is New Orleans' coronavirus death rate twice New York's? Obesity is a factor", "body": "(Reuters) - The coronavirus has been a far deadlier threat in New Orleans than the rest of the United States, with a per-capita death rate twice that of New York City. Doctors, public health officials and available data say the Big Easy's high levels of obesity and related ailments may be part of the problem.\n\n\"We're just sicker,\" said Rebekah Gee, who until January was the health secretary for Louisiana and now heads Louisiana State University's healthcare services division. \"We already had tremendous healthcare disparities before this pandemic - one can only imagine they are being amplified now.\"\n\nAlong with New York and Seattle, New Orleans has emerged as one of the early U.S. hot spots for the coronavirus, making it a national test case for how to control and treat the disease it causes. Chief among the concerns raised by doctors working in the Louisiana city is the death rate, which is twice that of New York and over four times that of Seattle, based on Thursday's publicly reported data.\n\nNew Orleans residents suffer from obesity, diabetes and hypertension at rates higher than the national average, conditions that doctors and public health officials say can make patients more vulnerable to COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nSome 97% of those killed by COVID-19 in Louisiana had a pre-existing condition, according to the state health department. Diabetes was seen in 40% of the deaths, obesity in 25%, chronic kidney disease in 23% and cardiac problems in 21%.\n\nOrleans Parish, which encompasses the city, reported 125 confirmed coronavirus deaths as of Thursday, the equivalent of 32 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people. That rate for New York City was at 15.9 on Thursday.\n\nNew Orleans could be a harbinger for the potential toll the pandemic could take in other parts of the South and Midwest that also have high rates of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension.\n\nA host of other factors could contribute to New Orleans' high death rate from COVID-19, ranging from access to healthcare and hospital quality, to the prevalence of other conditions, including lung disease, health officials say.\n\nBut they also note that it is clear that obesity-related conditions are playing a role in the deaths. That could be a warning sign for the United States at large, where chronic obesity is more common than in other developed countries, they said.\n\nHospitals are reporting cases across the generations -mothers and daughters, fathers and sons - being intubated and cared for in the same intensive care units, said Tracey Moffatt, the chief nursing officer at Ochsner Health, the largest healthcare provider in Louisiana. The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease in New Orleans and Louisiana plays into that, she said.\n\nThose family members often suffered from the same medical conditions before becoming sick, leaving them similarly vulnerable to the coronavirus despite their age gaps.\n\n\"We had a case where a mom was already in the ICU and the daughter, who was obese, came in,\" she said. \"The daughter asked staff to wheel her by her mom's room so she could say goodbye before she herself was intubated. We knew the mother was going to pass away.\"\n\nBoth patients suffered from obesity.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week released for the first time a report showing that 78% of COVID-19 patients in ICUs in the United States had an underlying health condition, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease.\n\nThe CDC report was based on a sample of under 6% of reported coronavirus infections, but doctors in Louisiana said it was consistent with what they are seeing, and it is in line with what other countries like Italy and China have faced.\n\nThose percentages, said Dr. Joseph Kanter, an emergency department doctor and the top public health official in New Orleans, are likely similar in cities across the United States.\n\n\"What we worry about here is that we have more people in our communities with those conditions,\" he said. \"We're more vulnerable than other communities, and the number of deaths we've seen illustrates that.\"\n\nThe New Orleans metropolitan statistical area ranks among the worst in the United States for the percentage of residents with diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, a Reuters analysis of CDC data shows. An estimated 39% have high blood pressure, 36% are obese and about 15% have diabetes.\n\nNationally, the median is 32% with high blood pressure, 31% obese and 11% with diabetes.\n\n\"The burden of disease in Louisiana and the Deep South is higher than in the rest of the country,\" said Gee. \"Invariably that means that the South is going to be hard hit by this.\"", "source": {"uri":
