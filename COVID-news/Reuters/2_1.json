It reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales last week, or 39% when considering some cloud services Microsoft sells through other units.\n\nWhile financial analysts applauded the new transparency from Alphabet, some questioned executives for the second time in the last four quarters to explain why overall revenue has been missing or just barely meeting their expectations. Sales growth dipped below 20% in three quarters during 2019, compared to just once in the previous three years.\n\nAlphabet has blamed currency exchange rates and its constant tweaking of features, saying that it is not focused on quarterly marks.\n\n\"We continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience,\" Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat responded to an analyst. \"But there will be variability over time because we're very focused on what's in the right long-term interest.\"\n\nShares of the company fell about 4.5% in extended trading to $1,416.\n\n\"The stock was priced for perfection, and a top-line miss was enough to send it lower,\" said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. \"YouTube was impressive at $15 billion for the year, Cloud less so at $8.9 billion.\"\n\nOther financial analysts said YouTube's ad revenue was underwhelming too.\n\n\"YouTube is smaller than generally assumed, but on the flipside, search seems to have accelerated and is growing faster than feared,\" said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.\n\nGoogle through its namesake search engine as well as properties such as YouTube has been the web's biggest draw for advertisers for a decade, enabling it last month to become the fourth listed company to top $1 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nBut new concerns have emerged among investors about whether its dominance will last as U.S. antitrust regulators investigate Google and as Amazon and Facebook Inc (FB.O) continue to grow their ads businesses globally. Both beat analysts' expectations last week.\n\nAlphabet's overall sales in the fourth quarter were $46.08 billion, up 17%, compared with an average estimate of $46.94 billion among financial analysts tracked by Refinitiv.\n\nGoogle ad sales in the holiday shopping quarter were $37.93 billion, up 16.7% from the same period last year\n\nAlphabet's expenses have ballooned with hiring of thousands of salespeople, building of new data centers and marketing the Google brand through hardware and other ventures.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Alphabet's total costs and expenses rose 18.5% from a year ago to $36.809 billion.\n\nPorat said hiring and infrastructure spending would accelerate in 2020.\n\nAlphabet's fourth-quarter profit was $10.67 billion, or $15.35 per share, compared with the analysts' average estimate of $8.787 billion, or $12.53 per share.\n\nHardware sales fell in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago, Porat said. Results could suffer further from any protracted work stoppages in Asia as companies combat the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China, she said.\n\nGoogle last week temporarily shut down all its offices in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan due to the coronavirus. It has thousands of engineers across the region, including a hardware engineering center in Taiwan.\n\n(Graphic: Alphabet's total revenue vs. operating expenses - here)\n\nIn December, Google CEO Pichai gained the additional role of Alphabet CEO from Larry Page as he and fellow co-founder Sergey Brin stepped back even further from day-to-day management.\n\nThe new YouTube disclosures under Pichai showed ad revenue grew 31% compared with last year.\n\nPichai also said YouTube, which has 2 billion monthly users, generated about $750 million in subscription and other non-advertising revenue, but did not reveal a figure for the year-earlier period.\n\nPichai said YouTube had 20 million paid subscribers between YouTube's Music and Premium ad-free viewing packages, and separately had 2 million paid subscribers for YouTube TV, which competes with Dish Network Corp's (DISH.O) Sling TV and Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) Hulu to stream television online.\n\nAmazon recently said it has 55 million music subscribers, while Apple Inc (AAPL.O) last year announced 60 million such subscribers. Sling had about 2.7 million subscribers as of last year, in line with estimates for Hulu.\n\nShares of Alphabet were up 28.1% in the last 12 months entering Monday, compared with 21.8% for Facebook shares, 23.5% for Amazon, 68.1% for Microsoft and 88.7% for Apple Inc (AAPL.O).", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tuesday and the S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day gain in about six months as fears of a heavy economic impact from the coronavirus outbreak waned after China's central bank intervened.\n\nThe Dow notched its biggest single-day rise in more than five months, as the stock market recovered from steep losses in the prior week.\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected a total of 1.7 trillion yuan ($242.74 billion) through reverse repos on Monday and Tuesday, as the central bank said it sought to stabilize financial market expectations and restore market confidence.\n\nThe stimulus boosted investor sentiment even as fallout from the coronavirus from China is expected to deliver a short, sharp blow to both Chinese and global economic activity in the first quarter.\n\n\"The market is just looking beyond coronavirus and they are cheering\" China's financial actions, said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist with Ally Invest.\n\n\"What history has shown us is anytime there is any sort of epidemic or some global threat from a virus standpoint, what we have seen is that the market will bottom,\" Bell said. \"Everybody is just looking past that, even though the market didn't move

robust demand for defense aircraft.\n\nTechnology shares .SPLRCT led gains among the S&P 500 sectors, rising 2.6%. Shares of chip companies, which are particularly exposed to China, surged, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX up 3.1%.\n\nShares of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) fell 2.5%, after the Google parent posted its first holiday-quarter revenue miss in five years.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings season is roughly halfway done, with S&P 500 companies expected to have increased earnings by 1.6% in the period, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. However, earnings in 2020 are expected to rise 8.7%.\n\n\"Though the Q4 earnings do feel somewhat underwhelming, they are consistent with the market view that they will grow from here,\" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones.\n\nInvestors were also keeping an eye on the U.S. Democratic presidential nominating race, where technical problems delayed the Iowa caucus results. Results are expected at 5 p.m. ET.\n\nIn company news, shares of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surged 13.7%, extending a stunning rally for the electric vehicle maker's stock.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered

equity markets surged for a third day as expectations of more central bank stimulus and media reports that suggest scientists are closing in on a vaccine for the deadly coronavirus boosted sentiment.\n\nU.S Treasury yields rose as traders welcomed early reports that a Chinese university team found a drug to treat those infected with the virus while UK researchers said they made a \"significant breakthrough\" in finding a vaccine.\n\nThe acceleration of euro zone business activity in January, indicating the worst may be over for the bloc's economy, while U.S. data showed an economy that is growing, albeit moderately, also boosted risk appetite and doused a bid for safe havens.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.72%, about 1.3% from a record high set almost three weeks ago. But the Nasdaq on Wall Street set a new high and the benchmark S&P 500 was about four-tenths of 1% from a fresh record.\n\nYousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone Financial Inc in New York said stimulus efforts by China's central bank and greater U.S. liquidity because of Federal Reserve operations in the repo market have boosted risk assets.\n\n\"I have a tough time justifying why this market is trading at 19 times earnings and why we have managed to snap back from any sell-off since October,\" Abbasi said, regarding U.S. stocks.\n\n\"But at this point, looking at this market, it almost feels like any hiccup further emboldens the global central bank put,\" he said, referring to central bank activity that increases market liquidity and encourages risk taking.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 311.47 points, or 1.08%, to 29,119.1. The S&P 500 gained 26.62 points, or 0.81%, to 3,324.21 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.13 points, or 0.25%, to 9,492.10.\n\nIn Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 1.19% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.72%, while emerging market stocks rose 0.55%.\n\nIHS Markit's final euro zone composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good indicator of economic health, rose to a five-month high of 51.3 in January from 50.9 the previous month.\n\nU.S. data also was encouraging.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of55.5 in January, the highest level since August. Data forDecember was revised slightly down to show the index at areading of 54.9 instead of the previously reported 55.0.\n\nReadings above 50 indicate economic expansion.\n\nThe dollar gained against the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc, as risk appetite rose on reports of a possible treatment for the coronavirus.\n\nThe U.S. currency also benefited from a private-sector payrolls report for January that surpassed market expectations, suggesting the world's largest economy was on a stable growth path and interest rate cuts were off the table for now.\n\nU.S. private-sector payrolls increased by 291,000 in January, according to the ADP National Employment Report, far above expectations of an increase of 156,000 jobs. January's job gains were the largest since May 2015.\n\nThe dollar index rose 0.29%, with the euro down 0.38% to $1.1. The yen weakened 0.15% versus the greenback at 109.71 per dollar.\n\nOvernight in Asia, stringent containment measures, along with the billions of dollars Chinese authorities have pumped into the economy, boosted mainland China indexes more than 1%. The bourses have clawed back half of the $700 billion in market capitalization that was wiped out during Monday's almost 8% rout.\n\nOil prices jumped 4% after media reports highlighted a potential vaccine, though the World Health Organization played down the news, saying there are \"no known effective therapeutics\" against the virus.\n\nBrent crude oil futures rose $2.07 to $56.03 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained $1.72 to $51.33.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

coronavirus out of China.\n\nU.S. factory activity rebounded in January after contracting for five straight months amid a surge in new orders, according to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM).\n\n\"Investors are looking beyond the potential negative impacts of the coronavirus,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. \"Historically,

Democrats in Iowa kick off the party's nominating process on Monday with the state caucuses.\n\nThe U.S. Senate was due to vote on Wednesday on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office following the impeachment process, with the Republican-controlled body widely expected to acquit him.\n\n\"The uncertainty caused by the impeachment case looks like it will be over by the middle of the week,\" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nIn company news, Tesla Inc shares soared 19.9% as Panasonic Corp reported the first quarterly profit in its U.S. battery business with the electric vehicle maker.\n\nGilead Sciences Inc shares gained 5.0% after the drugmaker said it has provided its experimental Ebola therapy for use in a small number of patients with the coronavirus.\n\nNike Inc shares rose 3.1% after JP Morgan added the stock to its focus list.\n\nThe fourth-quarter earnings season is about halfway done.

airlifted from the epicenter of China's fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak were placed under quarantine at two military bases in California on Wednesday, as the number of confirmed U.S. cases of the disease rose to 12.\n\nThe travelers aboard two State Department-chartered cargo jets were met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for immediate screening, and are to remain under mandatory quarantine for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus.\n\nThe latest evacuees, together with 195 Americans flown out of Wuhan, China, a week ago by the U.S. government, brings to nearly 400 the number people subject so far to the CDC's first public health quarantine in 50 years. Wuhan, in China's Hubei province, is the epicenter of the disease.\n\nThe two planes in Wednesday's airlift arrived at Travis Air Force Base in northern California, where 178 passengers from one plane disembarked to begin two weeks of round-the-clock health screening while barred from contact with the general public.\n\nNone of the group showed signs of disease, except for a small child who developed a fever during the flight and was taken to a nearby hospital with its mother for further testing and medical treatment in isolation, officials said. The other evacuees at Travis will be housed in a hotel on base.\n\nAfter refueling, the second evacuation plane flew on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, where about 170 passengers were placed under quarantine at two housing sites there.\n\n\"Because these individuals were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where there is intense and escalating community-wide spread of this novel coronavirus, we consider them at high risk of exposure,\" said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.\n\n\"We are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,\" Braden told reporters during a briefing at Miramar.\n\nHe stressed that the CDC's strategy of early detection and containment of individuals who are sick or at high risk of exposure has been successful in preventing widespread transmission in the United States so far.\n\n\"If there were ongoing community spread of this virus we would know it, and that's not happening,\" Braden said. \"So right now, in the United States, communities across this country are at very low risk of being exposed to this virus, including in San Diego and including on this base.\"\n\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 500 people, most in and around Wuhan, and infected more than 28,000.\n\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. The latest patient, reported in Wisconsin on Wednesday, is isolated at home and \"doing well,\" the state health agency said in a statement.\n\nAs with nine other U.S. cases documented to date, that person fell ill after traveling to China and was exposed to known cases there, the state health department said. Just two confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases were transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both between spouses.\n\nThe protocols put in place at Travis and Miramar are the same that were instituted at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles, where the first group of 195 Americans airlifted from Wuhan landed last Wednesday and are midway through their two-week quarantine.\n\nThe CDC said the government expects to fly additional groups of Americans and their families from China to other U.S. military bases designated for quarantine in Texas and Nebraska.\n\nAs part of a U.S.

fears outweigh hopes for bigger OPEC+ cuts", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices sank about 1% on Tuesday as fears that energy demand would take a long-term hit from the growing coronavirus outbreak outweighed hopes for more production cuts from OPEC and its allies.\n\nBrent crude settled at $53.96 a barrel, sliding 49 cents, or 0.9%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled at $49.61 a barrel, losing 50 cents, or 1%. Both benchmarks were at their lowest since January 2019.\n\n\"I think the fear of demand destruction continues to really have the market by its throat,\" said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nOil slid sharply over the past two weeks on concerns over the global economic impact of China's coronavirus, which by Tuesday had claimed 427 lives, infected 20,438 in mainland China and had been detected in roughly two dozen countries.\n\nIn early trading, it bounced higher on hopes of further output cuts from OPEC+, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia.\n\nAn OPEC+ committee weighed the impact on global oil demand and economic growth of the outbreak of the coronavirus at a meeting, hearing from China's envoy to the United Nations in Vienna and discussing how to respond.\n\nSources close to the matter told Reuters that OPEC+ was considering cutting crude output by a further 500,000 barrels per day (bpd).\n\nHowever, the producer group could face an uphill battle to put more cuts in place so soon after the existing pact was agreed to and because of uncertainty over how long the virus crisis will last.\n\n\"If the producer group believes the outbreak to be contained, with effects tapering out after a short period, like SARS, they have the option to stand pat and weather the lower price environment until demand returns,\" the global head of commodity strategy at BNP Paribas, Harry Tchilinguirian, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.\n\nPrice gains were also limited by Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak's comments that he was uncertain it was time to tighten oil output curbs.\n\nBP finance chief Brian Gilvary told Reuters the economic impact of the coronavirus will reduce oil consumption for the whole year by 300,000 to 500,000 bpd, roughly 0.5% of global demand.\n\nGoldman Sachs warned that the outbreak's impact on demand is likely to keep spot-price volatility elevated.\n\n\"Oil prices are now at levels where we would expect a supply response from both OPEC and shale producers, and where China would likely seek to build crude inventories,\" Goldman said in a note.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Coronavirus deaths top SARS as China returns to...", "body": "SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China raised the death toll from its coronavirus outbreak to 811 on Sunday, passing the number killed globally by the SARS epidemic, as authorities made plans for millions of people returning to work after an extended Lunar New Year break.\n\nMany of China's usually teeming cities have almost become ghost towns during the past two weeks as Communist Party rulers ordered virtual lockdowns, canceled flights, closed factories and shut schools.\n\nEven on Monday, a large number of workplaces and schools will remain closed and many white-collar employees will work from home.\n\nThe scale of the potential hit to an economy that has been the engine of global growth in recent years has taken a toll on financial markets, as shares slumped and investors switched into safe-havens such as gold, bonds and the Japanese yen.\n\nChina's ambassador to Britain described the newly identified virus as \"the enemy of mankind\" in a BBC interview on Sunday, but added it \"is controllable, is preventable, is curable\".\n\n\"At this moment is very difficult to predict when we are going to have an inflection point,\" Liu Xiaoming said. \"We certainly hope it will come soon, but the isolation and quarantine measures have been very effective.\"\n\nChina's cabinet said it would coordinate with transport authorities to ensure the smooth return to work of employees in key industries such as food and medicines.\n\nThe State Council's special coronavirus group also said workers should return in \"batches\", rather than all at once, in order to reduce infection risks.\n\nChina's National Health Commission recorded another 89 deaths on Saturday, pushing the total well above the 774 who died from SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2002/2003.\n\nTotal confirmed coronavirus cases in China stood at 37,198, commission data showed. New infections recorded the first drop below 3,000 cases Feb. 2, at 2,656 cases. Of those, 2,147 cases were in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nThe virus has also spread to at least 27 countries and territories, according to a Reuters count based on official reports, infecting more than 330 people. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China - both of Chinese nationals.\n\nThe latest patients outside China include a group of British nationals staying in a mountain village in Haute-Savoie in the Alps, French health officials said, raising fears of further infections at a busy period in the ski season.\n\nA British man who contracted the virus while attending a conference in Singapore may have infected seven other people when he stopped off at a chalet in the French village on his way home, health experts said. Those infected include a British man diagnosed in Spain and a Briton found to have the disease in the UK, both of whom appeared to have been part of the chalet group.\n\nAs millions of Chinese prepared to go back to work, the public dismay and mistrust of official numbers was evident on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter.\n\n\"What's even more frustrating is that these are only the 'official' data,\" said one user.\n\n\"We all know we can't purchase masks anywhere, why are we still going back to work?\" said a second.\n\n\"More than 20,000 doctors and nurses around the country have been sent to Hubei, but why are the numbers still rising?\" asked a third.\n\nAuthorities had told businesses to tack up to 10 extra days on to holidays that had been due to finish at the end of January and some restrictions continued.\n\nGaming giant Tencent Holdings said it had asked staff to continue working from home until Feb. 21.\n\nHebei province, which surrounds Beijing, will keep schools shut until March 1, the People's Daily newspaper said. Several provinces have shut schools until the end of February.\n\nThe local government in the southern manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, meanwhile, denied a report in the Nikkei business daily that it had blocked a plan by Apple supplier Foxconn Technology Co to resume production in China from Monday. The company would restart once inspections were completed, it said.\n\nAmong the latest deaths, 81 were in Hubei.\n\nAn American hospitalized in the provincial capital Wuhan, where the outbreak began, became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim. The Washington Post identified him as Hong Ling, a 53-year old geneticist who studied rare diseases at Berkeley.\n\nJoseph Eisenberg, professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, said it was too early to say whether the epidemic was peaking.\n\n\"Even if reported cases might be peaking, we don't know what is happening with unreported cases,\" he said.\n\nMajor cities and capitals announced new travel restrictions as concern over the spread of the virus increased.\n\nChinese-ruled Hong Kong introduced a two-week quarantine on Saturday for all people arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the previous 14 days. Malaysia expanded its ban on visitors from China.\n\nFrance issued a new travel advisory for its citizens, saying it did not recommend traveling to China unless there was an \"imperative\" reason. Italy asked children traveling from China to stay away from school for two weeks voluntarily.\n\nPrincess Cruises, operator of the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off Japan, said a further six people had tested positive, bringing the total cases aboard to 70.\n\n(This story corrects milestone of new infections on Saturday in paragraph 10)", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType":

"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN1ZZ061", "title": "Oil prices jump 2% as virus vaccine reports spur hope", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped about 2% on Wednesday on media reports that suggested scientists were developing a vaccine for the fast-spreading coronavirus, even as world health experts said treatments have not yet been found.\n\nAlso supporting oil was news that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its producer allies were considering further output cuts to counter a potential squeeze on global oil demand.\n\nThe outbreak has killed nearly 500 people and is weighing on global economic activity and oil demand.\n\nThe World Health Organization played down the media reports, saying there were \"no known effective therapeutics\" against the virus.\n\nBrent crude oil futures LCOc1 ended the session up $1.32, or 2.5%, at $56.46 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 gained $1.14, or 2.3%, to settle at $50.75. Both contracts rose more than 4% during the session.\n\nPrices held gains after data showed U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI rose by 3.4 million barrels in the week to Jan. 31, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a rise of 2.8 million barrels.\n\n\"The report probably had nothing shocking enough to ruin the momentum of the big crude comeback that we are seeing today,\" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.\n\n\"The main reason oil sold off as hard as it did wasn't because of what we knew; it was what we didn't know. Now, it seems like we can quantify the demand destruction and look ahead.\"\n\nChina's Changjiang Daily newspaper reported on Tuesday that a team of researchers led by Zhejiang University Professor Li Lanjuan had found that drugs Abidol and Darunavir can inhibit the virus in vitro cell experiments.\n\nSeparately, Sky News reported that a British scientist has made a significant breakthrough in the race for a vaccine by reducing part of the normal development time from two to three years to only 14 days.\n\nStill, refineries including China's Sinopec, Asia's top refiner, have slashed throughput as the virus cuts demand for refined fuels.\n\nFears of a slump in global oil demand had pushed U.S. crude and Brent futures into contango this week - a structure in which longer-dated oil futures trade at a premium that encourages traders to keep crude in storage for more profitable resale in the future.\n\n\"Based on our forecast that China's GDP growth will slow to just 3% year-over-year in Q1 2020 and assuming that the virus is brought under control relatively quickly, we have tentatively penciled in a 10% drop in the country's oil consumption in Q1,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a note on Wednesday. \"This pushes the global market into a small surplus in the first half of 2020.\"\n\nFalling demand for jet fuel worldwide because of the deadly coronavirus has also hit U.S. prices for the product, which dropped to their lowest seasonally in five years, market participants said.\n\nCompanies including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Phillips 66 (PSX.N) have limited business travel to China\n\nA slowdown in the global economy resulting from the outbreak is expected to reduce 2020 worldwide oil demand growth by 300,000-500,000 barrels per day (bpd), roughly 0.5% of total demand, BP's Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said.\n\n\"The (Chinese) economy will be weakened for some time to come as quarantines, social distancing and travel restrictions remain in place,\" BNP Paribas analyst Harry Tchilinguirian told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.\n\n\"But as financial markets are anticipatory, one can see how favorable news in relation to potential medical solutions, or indications that we have reached a turning point in the progress of the virus outbreak, are likely to be interpreted positively.\"\n\nOPEC and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, considered the impact on global oil demand and economic growth from the coronavirus at a meeting on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, Russia was not supporting a deeper oil output cut and was suggesting an extension of the current pact, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

weeks on virus-hit cruise ship off Japan", "body": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Around 3,700 people are facing at least two weeks locked away on a cruise liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed on Wednesday that 10 people on the ship had tested positive for coronavirus and more cases were possible.\n\nWhile the infected patients were transferred by Japan's coast guard to hospitals on the mainland, the rest of the passengers and crew on board the Carnival Corp (CCL.N) ship were placed in quarantine and given health screenings. The 10 cases were among 31 results received so far from 273 people tested.\n\nPassengers on Carnival's Diamond Princess, which had arrived in Yokohama on Monday after a 14-day round trip, will now spend another two weeks on the ship off Yokohama port near Tokyo.\n\nThey took to social media to detail their predicament, posting photos of officials in masks and gowns conducting health checks, room service meals and empty corridors and decks.\n\nBritish passenger David Abel said passengers were confined to their cabins on Wednesday morning, with staff delivering food room-by-room.\n\n\"The challenging situation for me is that I'm an insulin dependent diabetic,\" Abel said in a video taken in his cabin and posted to his Facebook page, adding that regular and timed food intake was a key part of managing his condition.\n\n\"We don't have a choice in what we can eat, the announcement recently was that they're starting on the bottom deck and working their way up - I'm on the ninth deck.\"\n\nA 43-year-old Hong Kong resident on the ship with six family members said they had been given coffee and water, but no food, by lunchtime on Wednesday. They were hungry but had snacks of their own, he said.\n\n\"I am not looking forward to the range of emotions in the next two weeks,\" he told Reuters from his family's windowless room, declining to be named. \"Will deal as they come.\"\n\nAnother passenger, using the handle @daxa_tw, tweeted that he was \"hearing from many sides that people are troubled and uneasy\".\n\nCarnival's Princess Cruises said quarantined passengers would get free internet and telephone services and the crew was working to keep them comfortable.\n\nThe ship was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man tested positive for the virus after disembarking in Hong Kong on Jan. 25. The man had joined a shore excursion in Kagoshima, southwestern Japan, on Jan. 22, local media reported.\n\nHe was believed to have been in close contact with 36 passengers, Kyodo news reported, citing Japan's health ministry. Two of those people are among the 10 who have already tested positive, Kyodo said.\n\nSeparately, public broadcaster NHK said a man in his 40s, who was visiting Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, from China's Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, had tested positive. That brought the total number of people infected in Japan to 34.\n\nHealth Minister Katsunobu Kato said officials would continue to monitor the remaining passengers and crew for the potential development of symptoms.\n\nNone of the 10 infected people - three each from Japan and Hong Kong, two Australians, one American and one Filipino crew member - had severe symptoms, NHK reported.\n\nCarnival said quarantined passengers would get a full refund and a future cruise credit.\n\nThe ship would go out to sea to perform \"normal marine operations\", it added, including the production of fresh water, before receiving food and other supplies from Yokohama.\n\nNot all passengers were overly concerned about their situation. American Ashley Rhodes-Courter posted a text message exchange on Instagram with her parents, Gay and Phil Courter, who are on board the ship.\n\n\"The food is great, the staff is in good spirits and we're all in the same boat,\" the couple said, \"plus they have not run out of some great Pinot noir.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [],

passengers and crew on two cruise ships in Asian waters were placed in quarantine for China's coronavirus on Wednesday as airlines, car manufacturers and other global companies counted the cost of the fast-spreading outbreak.\n\nChina said another 65 people had died as of Tuesday, the highest daily total yet, taking the overall toll on the mainland to 490, most in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan, where the new virus emerged late last year.\n\nThere have been two deaths outside mainland China - in the Philippines and Hong Kong - both following visits to Wuhan.\n\nThe virus had disrupted air travel, with more than two dozen airlines suspending or restricting flights to China and several countries, including the United States, banning the entry of anyone who has been in China over the previous two weeks.\n\nTaiwan banned the entry of mainland residents from Thursday.\n\nFor more on the Coronavirus outbreak, click: here\n\nThe disruption spread to cruise ships this week, with about 3,700 people facing at least two weeks cut off aboard a liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed 10 passengers had tested positive for the virus.\n\nPassengers on the Diamond Princess posted pictures online of officials in masks and gowns conducting health checks and an empty deck.\n\n\"This is not a good situation,\" British passenger David Abel said in a video shot in his cabin and posted to Facebook.\n\nIn Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers and crew were confined to their ship docked in the city for tests after three people on board had tested positive earlier.\n\nHong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) asked its 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave, saying conditions were as grave now as during the 2009 financial crisis.\n\nAmerican Airlines Group (AAL.O) and United Airlines (UAL.O) said they would suspend flights to and from Hong Kong after this week, a step that would leave no U.S. carriers flying passengers to the Asian financial hub.\n\nNearly $700 billion was wiped off mainland Chinese stocks on Monday with many factories shut, cities cut off and travel links constricted, fuelling worries about global supply chains.\n\nAsian stocks steadied on Wednesday.\n\nHyundai Motor (005380.KS) will suspend production in South Korea because of a disruption to the supply of parts, it said, becoming the first major carmaker to do so outside of China.\n\nGlobal carmakers have already extended factory closures in China in line with government guidelines. These include Hyundai, Tesla (TSLA.O), Ford (F.N), PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA), Nissan (7201.T) and Honda Motor 7267.T.\n\nPlanemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) has prolonged a planned closure of its final assembly plant in Tianjin, China, it said.\n\nTaiwan's Foxconn (2317.TW), which makes phones for global vendors including Apple (AAPL.O), aims to gradually restart factories in China next week but could take at least a week or two more to resume full production, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nGerman sportswear company Adidas (ADSGn.DE) said it was temporarily shutting a \"considerable\" number of its stores in China.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from a Phase 1 trade deal set to take effect this month.\n\nEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the virus was adding to economic doubts.\n\n\"While the threat of a trade war between the United States and China appears to have receded, the coronavirus adds a new layer of uncertainty,\" she said in Paris.\n\nEvidence of human-to-human spread outside China surfaced after an international business gathering in Singapore in January was linked to virus cases reported in Malaysia and South Korea, but authorities did not comment on its nature or the industry involved.\n\nSingapore - one of the worst hit countries outside China in the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - has reported 28 cases of the new coronavirus.\n\nAcross mainland China, there were 3,887 new confirmed infections of the coronavirus, making a total of 24,324. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in some 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus - officially called 2019-nCoV - a global emergency and says facemasks are important in curbing transmission if someone is showing symptoms. Pregnant women may be able to pass it to their unborn children, according to Chinese state media.\n\nAsked about various reports of \"drug breakthroughs\", WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV.\"\n\nRussia said it would take between eight and 10 months to develop a vaccine, Interfax reported. Scores of Russians began two weeks of quarantine in Siberia on Wednesday after being flown from Wuhan.\n\nBeijing has criticised as an overreaction U.S. travel curbs that bar foreign nationals who have visited China. About 350 Americans, the latest to be evacuated from Wuhan, landed in California on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

have shut factories in China, in line with government guidelines, or have flagged a hit to profits following the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBelow is a list of announcements by car companies, in alphabetical order.\n\n- Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) warned on Thursday that disruption to parts supplies could threaten production at one of its European plants within two to four weeks.\n\n- Ford Motor (F.N) plans to resume production on Feb. 10 at its factories in Chongqing and Hangzhou with joint venture partner Chongqing Changan Automobile (000625.SZ). Ford this week excluded any potential impact from its already weaker-than-expected forecast for the year, saying it was too early to make an estimate.\n\n- Honda (7267.T) confirmed on Friday it would restart its three plants in Wuhan, which it operates with Dongfeng Motor Group (0489.HK), on Feb. 13. Honda, which raised its annual profit forecast on Friday, said there were currently no supply chain issues that would impede production.\n\n- Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) said this week it would suspend production in South Korea due to the outbreak disrupting its supply chain, the first major automaker to do so outside China. Most of Hyundai's South Korean plants will be shut from Feb. 7, with some production lines expected to restart on Feb. 11 or Feb. 12, a union official said.\n\n- Nissan Motor (7201.T) said it is considering restarting production in China at its venture with Dongfeng sometime after Feb. 10. Production in Hubei will start sometime after Feb. 14, it said.\n\n- PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA), which is in the process of merging with Fiat, said last week its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until Feb. 14.\n\n- Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T) said on Friday it was considering sourcing vehicle components from outside China because the outbreak is threatening to disrupt vehicle production in its biggest market, India.\n\n- Tesla (TSLA.O) said last week that a delay to an increase in production in Shanghai due to a factory closure would hit profitability slightly. On Wednesday, a senior executive said Tesla would delay deliveries of Model 3 sedans built in that plant. The company is also evaluating whether the supply chain for cars built in its Fremont, California, plant will be affected.\n\n- Toyota Motor (7203.T) on Friday extended the shutdown of its China factories from Feb. 9 to Feb 16. The Japanese automaker operates 12 car and parts factories in regions such as the northern city of Tianjin and the southern province of Guangdong.\n\n- Valeo (VLOF.PA), a French car parts maker, said last week its three sites in Wuhan will remain shut until at least Feb. 13. On Wednesday, it said it was not experiencing any major disruption to its supply chain in China.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

carmaker posts fourth-quarter loss,...", "body": "DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) - Investors sent Ford Motor Co shares skidding on Tuesday after the company delivered a weaker-than-expected 2020 forecast, warning of higher warranty costs, lower profits at its credit arm and continued investments in future technology such as self-driving cars.\n\nShares in the No. 2 U.S. automaker plunged 9.4% in after-hours trading, shaving more than $3 billion off the company's value. In comparison, electric carmaker Tesla closed up nearly 14%, pushing its market cap to $160 billion, more than four times the size of Ford's $36.4 billion.\n\n\"The results were not OK in 2019,\" Ford Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone told reporters at the company's headquarters outside Detroit.\n\n\"As I look to 2020 and beyond, I'm very optimistic,\" he said, while cautioning that Ford's lower guidance does not yet account for the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China.\n\nIn an after-hours call with financial analysts, Chief Executive Jim Hackett was more blunt about the challenge of balancing Ford's protracted turnaround efforts with its continuing work on future technology, including electric and self-driving cars.\n\n\"I don't think this company can keep straddling the old and new worlds forever ... This company has to change,\" Hackett said.\n\nFord said it expects 2020 operating earnings to be in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share. Analysts were expecting $1.26 a share.\n\nStone said Ford expects to continue its quarterly dividend of 15 cents, which could cost the company $2.4 billion in 2020. Asked about continuing the dividend after lowering its 2020 guidance, Hackett said, \"We like to return value to shareholders.\"\n\nThe disappointing 2020 forecast, coming after Ford previously trimmed its 2019 outlook, is a blow for Hackett, who took the helm in May 2017.\n\nHe has been asking investors to be patient with a restructuring that has seen the formation of a wide-ranging alliance on commercial, electric and autonomous vehicles with Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and the sale of its money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by India's Mahindra & Mahindra.\n\nBut by Ford's own accounting, the restructuring is far from complete. It has booked $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take, and expects to book another $900 million to $1.4 billion this year.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2019, Ford reported a net loss of $1.7 billion, or 42 cents a share, compared with a loss of $100 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier.\n\nThe quarter included a loss of $2.2 billion due to higher contributions to its employee pension plans, something it disclosed last month.\n\nRevenue in the quarter fell 5% to $39.7 billion, above the $36.5 billion Wall Street had expected.\n\nFord's adjusted free cash flow fell 67% in the fourth quarter to $500 million, including the $600 million cost of bonuses related to a new labor deal with the United Auto Workers union. The UAW deal also played a role in driving North American automotive profit margins down to 2.8% in the fourth quarter.\n\nFord said its operating losses in China last year totaled $771 million, including a loss of $207 million in the fourth quarter. It lost $1.5 billion in 2018. Ford's market share in China in the fourth quarter fell to 2% from 2.3% last year.\n\nIn December, Ford said it would halve its operating loss in 2019 and nearly halve it again in 2020, followed by further improvement in 2021.\n\nHowever, that forecast was before the appearance of the fast-spreading coronavirus and its crippling effects on China's economy.\n\nFord's China sales fell about 15% in the fourth quarter and 26% for the year as it continued to lose ground in its second-biggest market. Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017.\n\nDetroit rivals General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are scheduled to report their

(005380.KS) will suspend production in South Korea because the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the supply of parts, it said, becoming the first major carmaker to do so outside of China.\n\nThe flu-like virus has killed more than 400 people and its economic impact has spread beyond mainland China.\n\nIn China, global automakers have already extended factory closures in line with government guidelines. Those manufacturers include Hyundai, Tesla (TSLA.O), Ford (F.N), PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA), Nissan (7201.T) and Honda Motor (7267.T).\n\n\"Hyundai and Kia may be more affected as they tend to import more parts from China than other global automakers,\" said Lee Hang-koo, senior researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade.\n\nEuropean carmakers have suffered disruptions only to their Chinese factories so far, with their European and U.S. plants still running thanks to localised supply chains in keeping with a \"build where you sell\" strategy.\n\nVolkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Audi (NSUG.DE) BMW (BMWG.DE) and Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) said their factories outside of China remain unaffected by supply bottlenecks.\n\nHyundai has built huge production capacity in China over the past two decades.\n\n\"South Korean parts makers followed and built their own facilities along with Hyundai,\" Lee said.\n\nSouth Korea imported $1.56 billion worth of auto parts from China in 2019, up from $1.47 billion in 2018, trade data shows.\n\nMost of Hyundai's South Korean factories will be fully idled from Feb. 7, with some production lines expected to restart on Feb. 11 or Feb. 12, a union official said, declining to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nSchedules for suspension will vary by production line, a Hyundai spokeswoman said.\n\nThe move follows a shortage of wiring harnesses, which Hyundai sources mainly in China, industry officials said.\n\nTwo of the affected suppliers, Kyungshin and Yura Corporation, said they were trying to boost production at their factories in South Korea and Southeast Asia to compensate for the disrupted supply from China.\n\nBoth also plan to resume production at their Chinese factories after Feb. 9.\n\n\"We are in an emergency,\" a Kyungshin official told Reuters.\n\nHyundai has seven factories in South Korea, catering for the local market and the United States, Europe, Middle East and other markets.\n\nIts production in South Korea accounts for about 40% of the company's global output.\n\nHyundai's decision to halt assembly lines at home could delay supplies of its popular sport utility vehicles (SUVs), such as the Palisade and Genesis GV80.\n\nThe automaker recently turned in its best quarterly profit in more than two years and said it was on track for higher profit margins, aided by increased sales of SUVs.\n\nThe virus outbreak may slow manufacturing activities in the automotive and other sectors, Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co (8031.T) has

scientists questioned research on Friday that suggested that the outbreak of coronavirus disease spreading from China might have passed from bats to humans through the illegal traffic of pangolins.\n\nSouth China Agricultural University, which said it had led the research, said on its website that the \"discovery will be of great significance for the prevention and control of the origin (of the new virus)\".\n\nChina's official Xinhua news agency reported that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus strain separated from pangolins in the study was 99% identical to that from infected people. It said the research had found pangolins - the world's only scaly mammals - to be \"the most likely intermediate host.\"\n\nBut James Wood, head of the veterinary medicine department at Britain's University of Cambridge, said the research was far from robust.\n\n\"The evidence for the potential involvement of pangolins in the outbreak has not been published, other than by a university press release. This is not scientific evidence,\" he said.\n\n\"Simply reporting detection of viral RNA with sequence similarity of more than 99% is not sufficient. Could these results have been caused by contamination from a highly infected environment?\"\n\nPangolins are one of Asia's most trafficked mammals, despite laws banning the trade, because their meat is considered a delicacy in countries such as China and their scales are used in traditional medicine.\n\nThe outbreak of disease caused by the new coronavirus, which has killed 636 people in mainland China, is believed to have started in a market in the city of Wuhan that also sold live wild animals.\n\nVirus experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species.\n\nJonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain's University of Nottingham, said that while the South China Agricultural University research was an interesting development, it was still unclear \"whether or not the endangered pangolin really is the reservoir\".\n\n\"We would need to see all of the genetic data to get a feel for how related the human and pangolin viruses are, and also gain an understanding of how prevalent this virus is in pangolins and whether or not these were being sold in the Wuhan wet markets,\" he said.\n\nDirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary medicine at Hong Kong's City University, also said the research was a long way from establishing a link between pangolins and the new coronavirus outbreak in humans.\n\n\"You can only draw more definitive conclusions if you compare prevalence (of the coronavirus) between different species based on representative samples, which these almost certainly are not,\" he said.",

man who contracted the new coronavirus while attending a conference in Singapore may have infected seven other people when he stopped off at a chalet in a French mountain village for a few days on his way home, health experts said on Sunday.\n\nThe man, Britain's third case of the virus, stayed with a group of holidaymakers for four days in the chalet in Les Contamines-Montjoie late last month.\n\nFive other Britons in the Alpine ski resort have since tested positive for the coronavirus, French officials said this weekend, linking the cases to the chalet group.\n\nThe trail does not appear to end there, however. The disease carried by the same man may have spread elsewhere, underlining the challenges health authorities face in containing infections in an era of global air travel.\n\nSpanish authorities said on Sunday that a British man had tested positive in Mallorca after coming into contact with an infected person in France, whom they said appeared to have been part of the chalet group.\n\nBritish health officials, meanwhile, said on Sunday that the country had recorded its fourth case of coronavirus, and the person had caught the illness from a Briton while in France.\n\n\"This new case would appear to be linked to the cluster of cases in the French ski resort,\" said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at England's University of East Anglia. \"As such, this case is part of the same cluster which is being reported as linked to a British national returning from Singapore.\"\n\nHowever, more broadly, while the outbreak of the new coronavirus has spread to at least 27 countries and territories, according to a Reuters count, only a tiny fraction of cases - about 330 out of over 37,000 - have been outside mainland China.\n\nResidents of Les Contamines-Montjoie, a few wearing facemasks, lined up on Sunday to get tested for the new coronavirus as authorities sought to contain the spread.\n\nFrench officials said they were tracing all the people who might have been in close contact with the group of 11 Britons exposed to the virus after sharing lodgings in the village.\n\nFive of those tested positive, including a nine-year-old child and their father. Two other children - the infected child's siblings - were hospitalized in France for checks, officials added.\n\nTheir mother had left the country by the time the investigation began and was under observation in a UK hospital, French officials said. It was not clear if she was the latest case to be diagnosed in Britain.\n\nSpanish authorities said the British man who had tested positive in Mallorca was one of four members of a family taken into observation on Friday after coming into contact with someone in France who was subsequently diagnosed with the virus.\n\nThe family appear to have been part of the larger group in the French ski resort, Fernando Simon, director of the Centre of Coordination of Health Emergencies at Spain's Health Ministry, told reporters.\n\nHowever he said he could not confirm this 100% because of respect for the family's privacy.\n\nThe family returned to Mallorca from France on Jan. 29 and the father started to show light symptoms 24 hours later.\n\nSimon said the man was currently \"in good health\" but was being kept in isolation and authorities were drawing up a list of everyone he may have come into contact with in Mallorca.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chalet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ski resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Alps", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Alps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Contamines-Montjoie", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Les Contamines-Montjoie"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Les Contamines-Montjoie"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of East Anglia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alps"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Medical_Relief", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Medical Relief", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200209&t=2&i=1487853577&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG1808C", "eventUri": null, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 2641}, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 2641, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1434710879", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-02-04", "time": "10:53:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-04T10:53:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-04T10:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-thailand-idUSKBN1ZY0ZF", "title": "Thailand confirms six new coronavirus cases, including four Thais", "body": "BANGKOK (Reuters) -

Tesla's (TSLA.O) stock tumbled 17% on Wednesday, hitting the brakes on a dramatic rally as a senior executive said the coronavirus outbreak in China would delay deliveries of its Model 3 cars and analysts warned of its high valuation.\n\nWith Tesla still up more than 25% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit a week ago, Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on Tesla to \"hold\" from \"buy,\" further shrinking the already small number of analysts who recommend buying the stock.\n\nTesla Vice President Tao Lin said on the Weibo social media platform that car deliveries from its new Shanghai plant would be temporarily delayed and that the company planned to restart production on Feb. 10.\n\nThe $2 billion factory is a key part of Chief Executive Elon Musk's plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year.\n\nNeedham analyst Rajvindra Gill, who recommends selling Tesla, warned in a report that Tesla's stock is trading at extreme price-to-earnings multiples compared to many leading technology companies.\n\nEven after Wednesday's drop, Tesla is trading at about 55 times expected 2021 net income, compared to Amazon (AMZN.O) at 49, Apple (AAPL.O) at 22 and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) at 23, according to Refinitiv data.\n\n\"We've never seen a stock rise that much that fast with such little regard to past fundamentals or track record,\" Gill wrote.\n\nTesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the Shanghai plant after the Chinese government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying that the death toll had reached 490 as of Tuesday, up 65 from the previous day.\n\n\"Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,\" Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share.\n\nThe stock was last down 17% at about $738. Wednesday's drop followed a sudden selloff in the final minutes of a rally on Tuesday that still left the stock up almost 14% in that session.\n\nTesla's rally of over 300% since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.\n\nStill, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG.DE). Even many Tesla bulls question the stock's valuation following its recent, electrifying surge.\n\nBarclays analyst Brian Johnson maintained his \"underweight\" rating on Tesla while raising his price target to $300 from $200.\n\n\"We continue to believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued - but nevertheless concede that the recent price action opens up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, and hence reduces that chance of a stalled business,\" Johnson wrote in a client note.\n\nFollowing Canaccord's downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Tesla's stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

marginal impact on global travel demand and the airline industry is healthy enough to absorb any economic slowdown in China, the chief executive of British Airways parent IAG (ICAG.L) said on Wednesday.\n\nDozens of airlines have suspended flights to China in response to the worsening health emergency that has killed close to 500, nearly all in the country, while a meeting of international aviation officials in Singapore was canceled.\n\n\"The aviation industry is very robust. We may see some marginal impact,\" IAG CEO Willie Walsh told reporters in Doha at a CAPA aviation summit.\n\nBritish Airways has suspended flights between London Heathrow and Beijing and Shanghai, which Walsh said represented around 1% of the airline's capacity.\n\nThere had been no impact on the group's other airlines, including Ireland's Aer Lingus and Spain's Iberia.\n\nWalsh, who steps down in March, said he did not expect the virus to deter people from traveling. Asked if the industry was healthy enough to absorb a downturn in China's economy, he said: \"without question\" adding that airlines were more capable of responding to economic shocks than in the past.\n\nQatar Airways, which owns a minority stake in IAG, has also canceled passenger flights to China, though its chief executive said that was because other countries had placed entry restrictions on those who had recently visited China.\n\nAkbar al-Baker said that made it difficult to staff China flights because those staff would not be able to operate flights to some other countries for some time afterwards.\n\nA global airline lobby, the International Air Transport Association said it was too early to say how much the virus would impact the industry this year but is confident of a recovery.\n\n\"This industry has demonstrated its ability to overcome these type of difficult events and overcome them successfully,\" Chief Executive Alexandre de Juniac told Reuters.", "source":

profit outlook on strong sales of smartphone image sensors after reporting a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly profit, but it warned of an impact from the Wuhan coronavirus on its global supply chain.\n\nDemand for image sensors has been strong enough that even with its plants operating at full capacity Sony has been unable to pile up planned inventories, Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said at an earnings briefing on Tuesday.\n\nBut he said sensor shipments could be disrupted if the spread of the coronavirus forces client smartphone makers to suspend their assembly plants in China for a prolonged period.\n\nThe virus outbreak could also rattle supply chains for its PlayStation gaming hardware and other consumer electronics, he said.\n\n\"We can't deny the possibility of the virus threat expanding to a scale large enough to wipe out our latest upward earnings revision,\" Totoki said.\n\nThe Japanese entertainment and electronics firm raised its annual operating profit forecast by 5% to 880 billion yen ($8.1 billion), roughly in line with the 878.47 billion yen consensus of 22 analysts compiled by Refinitiv.\n\nFor the October-December quarter, profit dropped 20% to 300.1 billion yen, still beating the 271.07 billion yen average analyst estimate. Excluding an accounting gain linked to the acquisition of music publisher EMI and that boosted profit a year earlier, the latest quarter marked a profit increase.\n\nSony's sensor business continued to thrive as smartphone makers compete to adopt larger image sensors and multiple lenses on embedded cameras for improved picture quality, driving quarterly profit at the business by 62% to 75.2 billion yen.\n\nThe Japanese firm controls about a half of the world's image sensor market, supplying most global smartphone makers including Apple Inc and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.\n\nTo reduce dependence on smartphones, Sony has been working on sensors for automotive applications.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony's gaming business saw profit fall 27% to 53.5 billion yen as sales of its six-year-old PlayStation 4 console continued to decline.\n\nThe firm has said the PlayStation 5, scheduled for release this year, will feature better graphics, advanced haptic controllers and other improvements.\n\nSony's share price has shot up more than 40% over the past year to its highest in nearly two decades - a vote of confidence for Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida's ability to retain momentum after a corporate turnaround led by his predecessor.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Image sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Huawei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Estimating", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Estimating", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Nonprofit_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Nonprofit Resources", "wgt": 6}], "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200204&t=2&i=1485562769&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG130CW", "eventUri": null, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 1874}, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 1874, "relevance": 76}], "totalResults": 690, "page": 1, "count": 25, "pages": 28}}
