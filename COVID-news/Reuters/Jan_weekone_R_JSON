Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of British-based global health charity The Wellcome Trust, said that while \"a cluster of patients with an unusual respiratory infection is, and should always be, a worry... if the infection is not passing person to person, the level of concern is somewhat reduced\".\n\nWang Yang, the Chinese transport ministry's chief engineer, told the briefing that authorities will step up efforts to prevent the pneumonia outbreak from spreading further during the holiday period, including ensuring proper disinfection in major public transportation hubs.\n\nThe WHO noted that coronaviruses emerge periodically -- including in 2002 to cause SARS and in 2012 to cause MERS -- and said more information was required to confirm the pathogen and understand the epidemiology of the outbreak and its progress.\n\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.
