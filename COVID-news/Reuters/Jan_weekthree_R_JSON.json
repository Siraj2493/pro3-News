The mayor of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, confirmed a sixth virus-related death and the United States reported its first case.\n\nInvestors worried about the threat of contagion as hundreds of millions travel for the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays, which peak over the coming weekend. Traders recalled the fallout from a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003 that killed about 800 people and which China initially covered up.\n\nEmerging market stocks lost 1.74%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.63% lower, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.91%.\n\nHong Kong, where the economy suffered broadly due to the SARS outbreak, saw its main stock index fall 2.8%, the most for any day in over five months.\n\nThe overnight chill in Asia carried over to European markets. Shares of luxury goods makers - which have large exposure to China - were among those declining the most.\n\nA U.S. index of airline stocks fell 2.6%. Hotel and casino operators Las Vegas Sands Corp and Wynn Resorts Ltd, both of which have large operations in China, dropped over 5%.\n\n\"The fear is this could mushroom into an epidemic that could cut into economic activity,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. \"If it turns into an epidemic, who's going to fly?\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 152.06 points, or 0.52 percent, to 29,196.04, the S&P 500 lost 8.83 points, or 0.27 percent, to 3,320.79 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.14 points, or 0.19 percent, to 9,370.81.\n\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.16 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.45 percent.\n\nIn other markets, U.S. 10-year government bond yields touched a two-week low while the safe-haven yen strengthened 0.34 percent versus the dollar at 109.83.\n\n\"The fear is that it could be a SARS-type event, which was an economic issue,\" said Ellis Phifer, market strategist at Raymond James in Tennessee. \"But this is all cautionary. The market is not panicking or anything.\"\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes last rose 20/32 in price to yield 1.7673 percent, from 1.835 percent late on Friday. Monday was a U.S. market holiday.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.01 percent, with the euro down 0.07 percent to $1.1086.\n\nSterling was last trading at $1.3042, up 0.25 percent on the day.\n\nThe Australian dollar dropped on the flu worries since the country attracts large numbers of Chinese tourists, who tend to be big spenders over the Lunar New Year holidays.\n\nThe dollar was last up 0.6% against the offshore yuan at 6.9073 per dollar.\n\nSome investors were relieved that U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron seemed to have struck a truce over a proposed digital tax. They agreed to hold off on a potential tariffs war until the end of the year, a French diplomatic source said.\n\nA tariff war between China and the United States was blamed for the global economic growth slowdown of last year.\n\nU.S. gold futures fell 0.16 percent to $1,556.30 an ounce.\n\nOil prices fell on expectations that a well-supplied market would be able to absorb disruptions that have cut Libya's crude production to a trickle.\n\nU.S. crude fell 0.5 percent to $58.34 per barrel and Brent was last at $64.51, down 1.06 percent on the day.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

the global economy.\n\nChina put on lockdown on Thursday two cities at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak amid fears the transmission rate will accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese

The S&P 500 ended slightly higher and the Nasdaq eked out a record closing high on Thursday, helped by a jump in Netflix, while news about the coronavirus outbreak spreading from China and mixed earnings results kept a lid on the market.\n\nThe S&P and the Nasdaq had both been trading down before news late in the session that Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) was assessing its experimental Ebola drug as a possible treatment for the virus.\n\nThe Dow ended modestly lower.\n\nEven as health officials in China put millions of people on lockdown in efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, which has so far claimed 18 lives, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was \"a bit too early\" to declare a global health emergency.\n\n\"The virus is, if not a diversion, it's something the traders are going to capitalize on,\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. \"It matters, but it matters to a subset of the market, not with investors who are looking past the next 24 hours.\"\n\nThe outbreak has strained global equity markets, just as millions of Chinese are preparing to travel for the Lunar New Year, which begins Saturday.\n\nThe fourth-quarter reporting season is gathering steam, with analysts now expecting fourth-quarter earnings to contract by 0.7% from a year ago. Of the 74 companies in the S&P 500 that have already posted results, 67.6% have beaten consensus expectations, according to Refinitiv data.\n\n\"Today we've got a situation where we've got a flat market, which would indicate that markets are comfortable with earnings and that expectations had risen given the rally going into the earnings season,\" Carlson said.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 26.18 points, or 0.09%, to 29,160.09, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 3.79 points, or 0.11%, to 3,325.54, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 18.71 points, or 0.2%, to 9,402.48.\n\nOf the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, six closed in the red. Healthcare .SPXHC was the biggest percentage loser, while industrials .SPLRCI enjoyed the largest gain.\n\nInsurance bellwether Travelers Cos Inc (TRV.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, with underwriting gains tripling and catastrophe losses falling. Nevertheless, the company's shares dropped 5.1%, and were the biggest drag on the blue-chip Dow.\n\nComcast Corp (CMCSA.O) beat Street estimates but lost more subscribers than analysts expected, sending its shares down 3.8%.\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX.N) results also came in above expectations, but investors focused on the mining company's drop in Indonesia production. Its stock fell 2.8%.\n\nAmong winners, Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) gained 3.5% after the rail operator said the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade pact should reverse slumping volumes.\n\nNetflix (NFLX.O) jumped 7.2%, rebounding from losses sparked by a disappointing forecast earlier in the week.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 53 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 98 new highs and 44 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 7.52 billion shares,

China was facing a \"grave situation\" as the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak jumped to 42, overshadowing Lunar New Year celebrations that began on Saturday.\n\nChina also announced further transport restrictions.\n\nWith more than 1,400 people infected worldwide, most of them in China, Hong Kong declared a virus emergency, scrapped celebrations and restricted links to mainland China.\n\nAustralia confirmed its first four cases and Canada its first on Saturday, after Malaysia confirmed four and France reported Europe's first cases on Friday, as health authorities around the world scrambled to prevent a pandemic.\n\nThe United States is arranging a charter flight on Sunday to bring its citizens and diplomats back from Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the epicenter of the outbreak, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn Hong Kong, with five confirmed cases, the city's leader Carrie Lam said flights and high speed rail trips between the city and Wuhan will be halted. Schools in Hong Kong that are currently on Lunar New Year holidays will remain closed until Feb. 17.\n\nXi held a politburo meeting on Saturday on measures to fight the \"accelerating\" outbreak, state television reported.\n\nAs of 8 p.m. local time (1200 GMT) on Saturday, the death toll in China had risen to 42, authorities reported. Some 1,372 people in China have been infected with the virus - traced to a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.\n\nThe virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States.\n\nIn Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, officials appealed for masks and protective suits.\n\n\"We are steadily pushing forward the disease control and prevention ... But right now we are facing an extremely severe public health crisis,\" Hu Yinghai, deputy director-general of the Civil Affairs Department, told a news briefing.\n\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\n\nRide-hailing giant Didi Chuxing said it was halting inter-city services to and from Beijing from Sunday, while the capital will also stop running inter-province shuttle buses.\n\nState broadcaster CCTV, citing an announcement from China's tourism industry association, said the country would halt all group tours, both at home and abroad, from Monday.\n\nWuhan said it would ban non-essential vehicles from its downtown starting Sunday, further paralyzing a city of 11 million that has been on virtual lockdown since Thursday, with nearly all flights canceled and checkpoints blocking the main roads leading out of town.\n\nAuthorities have since imposed transport restrictions on nearly all of Hubei province, which has a population of 59 million.\n\nAustralia confirmed its first four cases in two different cities on Saturday, and the country's chief health official said he expected more cases as Australia is a popular destination for Chinese tourists.\n\nCanada on Saturday identified its first case in a Toronto resident who recently returned from Wuhan.\n\nState-run China Global Television Network reported on Saturday that a doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan, 62-year-old Liang Wudong, had died from the virus.\n\nU.S. coffee chain Starbucks said it was closing all its Hubei outlets for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, following a similar move by McDonald's in five Hubei cities.\n\nWorkers in white protective suits checked temperatures of passengers entering the subway at Beijing's central railway station on Saturday, while some train services in the eastern Yangtze River Delta region were suspended, the local railway operator said.\n\nThere are fears transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the holiday, although many have canceled their plans.\n\nAirports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings.\n\nIn an illustration of how such efforts could miss cases, doctors at a Paris hospital said two of the three Chinese nationals in France who have been diagnosed with the virus had arrived in the country without showing any symptoms.\n\nThe World Health Organization this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency.\n\nA report by infectious disease specialists at Imperial College, London on Saturday said that despite this, the epidemic \"represents a clear and ongoing global health threat,\" adding: \"It is uncertain at the current time whether it is possible to contain the continuing epidemic within China.\"\n\nWhile China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after a cover-up of the 2002/2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) spread, officials in Wuhan have been criticized for their handling of the current outbreak.\n\nIn rare public dissent, a senior journalist at a Hubei newspaper run by the ruling Communist Party wrote on Friday on the Twitter-like Weibo social media platform that there should be an \"immediate\" change of leadership in Wuhan. The post was later removed.\n\nHubei province, where authorities are rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital in six days, announced on Saturday that there were 658 patients affected by the virus in treatment, 57 of whom were critically ill.\n\nShanghai Disneyland was closed from Saturday. Beijing's Lama Temple, where people make offerings for the New Year, has also closed, as have some other temples.\n\nBritain advised against all travel to Hubei and told its citizens in the province to leave.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

toll from the Wuhan coronavirus in China rose to six deaths on Tuesday and the first case was reported in the United States, sending markets tumbling on fears of economic damage as tourists canceled travel plans and airports stepped up screening.\n\nThe virus struck as millions of Chinese prepared to travel for the Lunar New Year, heightening contagion risks. Many in China scrambled to buy face masks to protect themselves from the previously unknown, flu-like infection.\n\nThe outbreak, which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, also worried financial markets as investors recalled China's Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002-2003, a coronavirus outbreak that killed nearly 800 people.\n\n\"We'll stay at home during the holiday. I'm scared as I remember SARS very well,\" said Zhang Xinyuan, who had been bound from Beijing for the Thai resort of Phuket before she and her husband decided to cancel their air tickets.\n\nA traveler from China was diagnosed in Seattle with the Wuhan coronavirus, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, the first case identified in the United States. The patient was in good condition, the CDC said.\n\nThe agency said it expected to see more cases in the United States, had developed a new test to identify the virus and was in talks with the National Institutes of Health about developing a vaccine.\n\nAuthorities have confirmed more than 300 cases of the virus in China, mostly in Wuhan. Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang told Chinese state television on Tuesday that six people had died in his city.\n\nThe disease is spreading around other parts of China, including five cases in capital Beijing.\n\nCases have also been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, all involving people who had been to Wuhan.\n\nFifteen medical personnel are among those infected.\n\nSymptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. The viral infection can cause pneumonia.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) is set to hold a meeting on Wednesday to consider whether the outbreak is an international public health emergency.\n\n\"Information about newly reported infections suggest there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission,\" said WHO's regional director for the western Pacific, Takeshi Kasai.\n\nNorth Korea is planning to temporarily ban foreign tourists, who are mainly Chinese, a foreign tour operator said.\n\nThough the origin of the virus has yet to be identified, WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to Wuhan's seafood market.\n\nThe scare stirred risk aversion on global markets, with Asia particularly hit.\n\nHong Kong, which suffered badly during the SARS outbreak, saw its index fall 2.8% .HSI. Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 0.9% and Shanghai blue chips .CSI300 fell 1.7%.\n\nIn Europe, shares of luxury goods makers were among those declining the most. Chinese shoppers account for most of the growth in the sector, and investors worried that health fears could deter Chinese consumers from traveling or shopping.\n\n\"The outbreak of a SARS-like coronavirus in Wuhan is developing into a major potential economic risk to the Asia-Pacific region now that there is medical evidence of human-to-human transmission,\" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit.\n\nSo far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions, but they may be discussed on Wednesday.\n\nAirports in the United States, Australia and across Asia have begun extra screening for passengers from Wuhan.\n\nIn the city itself, officials have been using infrared thermometers to screen passengers at airports, railway stations and other passenger terminals since Jan. 14.\n\nThe Lunar New Year is a major holiday for Chinese, many of whom travel to join family or have a foreign vacation.\n\nLong lines formed to buy face masks in cities. Some online vendors limited sales of masks and hand sanitizers as demand surged.\n\nShanghai city's market regulator warned it would punish speculators hoarding masks or other products used for

has killed 26 people in China was confirmed in Europe for the first time on Friday as it spreads despite Chinese attempts to quarantine the city at the heart of the outbreak.\n\nChina closed Shanghai Disneyland and part of the Great Wall and suspended public transportation in 10 cities as it rushed to contain the virus, stranding millions of people at the start of the country's Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nFrance reported two cases on Friday evening, the first ones discovered in Europe. More were likely, Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said.\n\nWuhan, a city of 11 million where the virus was first identified, is in virtual lockdown. Nearly all flights at Wuhan's airport have been canceled and checkpoints block the main roads leading out of town.\n\nAs the city slides into isolation, pharmacies have begun to run out of supplies and hospitals have been flooded with nervous residents. The city is rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital by Monday, state media said.\n\nDespite the lockdown, the virus is already spreading further afield.\n\nThe vast majority of the cases and all of the deaths have been in China, but it has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal and the United States. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the new virus.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday it had 63 patients under investigation, with two confirmed cases, both in people who had traveled to Wuhan.\n\nFollowing a congressional briefing by health officials, Republican U.S. Senator John Barrasso, a former physician, said people in the United States with the virus may have been infected up to 14 days ago in China.\n\n\"We want to try to stop and prevent people from coming to the United States if they have it,\" Barrasso told reporters, without providing details of how that might be accomplished.\n\nAirports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China.\n\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people.\n\nIt can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\n\nSymptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing medical conditions, the World Health Organization said.\n\nAs of Thursday, China's National Health Commission said there were 830 confirmed cases and 26 deaths.\n\nMost cases have been in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife.\n\nAs China scrambles to contain the outbreak, it has suspended transportation in 10 cities in the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located, the Hubei Daily reported.\n\nThe country will take further, more targeted measures, state television reported, citing a State Council meeting on Friday. It did not give further details.\n\n\"Local authorities should take more responsibility and have a stronger sense of urgency,\" state broadcaster CCTV said.\n\nWeek-long celebrations to welcome the Year of the Rat began on Friday, raising fears that the infection rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of people travel to see family at home and abroad.\n\nIn Wuhan, a handful of people got off a high-speed train that pulled into the city's station on Friday but nobody boarded.\n\n\"What choice do I have? It's Chinese New Year. We have to see our family,\" said a man getting off the train who gave his family name Hu.\n\nAs part of the restrictions, some sections of the Great Wall near Beijing will be closed from Saturday, state media said.\n\nBeijing's Lama Temple, where people traditionally make offerings for the new year, has closed, as have some other temples and the Forbidden City, the capital's most famous tourist attraction.\n\nShanghai Disneyland will close starting on Saturday. The theme park has a 100,000 daily capacity and sold out during last year's new year holiday.\n\nFilm premieres have been postponed and McDonald's suspended business in five cities in Hubei province.\n\n\"There's so much news, so much data, every 10 minutes there's an update, it's frightening, especially for people like us in a severely hit area,\" Lily Jin, 30, a resident of Wuhan, told Reuters by phone.\n\nThe WHO said on Thursday it was a \"bit too early\" to designate the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, which would require countries to step up their response.\n\nThat decision could well be reassessed in coming days as the situation evolves, said Anthony Fauci, the U.S. National Institutes of Health's top infectious disease official, adding that it was \"open to question\" whether shutting down travel would have a major effect.\n\n\"The mass involuntary quarantine in Wuhan and its neighboring cities is counterproductive,\" added Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington. \"A lockdown of Wuhan will drive the epidemic underground, provoking fear and panic.\"\n\nSome experts believe the virus is not as dangerous as the one that caused the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also began in China and killed nearly 800 people, or the one that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has killed more than 700 people since 2012.\n\nThree international research teams - using different approaches - have begun work on vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said.\n\nMarkets have been roiled this week on fears that the outbreak will curb travel and hurt economic demand. Shares in luxury goods companies have been particularly hard hit on fears of a drop in demand from China.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [],

"BEIJING (Reuters) - An outbreak of a new coronavirus has spread to more Chinese cities, including the capital Beijing and Shanghai, authorities said on Monday, and a fourth case has been reported beyond China's borders.\n\nChina's National Health Commission confirmed that the virus, which causes a type of pneumonia, can pass from person-to-person, the official Xinhua News Agency said.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping said curbing the outbreak and saving lives was a top priority as the number of patients more than tripled and a third person died.\n\nAdding to the difficulties of containing it, hundreds of millions of Chinese will be traveling domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday that starts this week.\n\nAuthorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travelers from Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first discovered.\n\n\"Wuhan is a major hub and with travel being a huge part of the fast approaching Chinese New Year, the concern level must remain high. There is more to come from this outbreak,\" said Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity.\n\nAuthorities confirmed a total of 217 new cases of the virus in China as of 6 p.m. local time (1000 GMT) on Monday, state television reported, 198 of which were in Wuhan.\n\nFive new cases were confirmed in Beijing and 14 more in Guangdong province, the report said. Another statement confirmed a new case in Shanghai, bringing the number of known cases worldwide to 222.\n\n\"People's lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,\" President Xi was quoted as saying by state television.\n\nThe virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.\n\nIts symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts.\n\nZhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed that two cases of infection in Guangdong province were due to human-to-human transmission, Xinhua said. Some medical staff have been infected, it added, but gave no number.\n\nSouth Korea on Monday confirmed its first case, a 35-year-old Chinese national who had traveled from Wuhan, the fourth patient reported outside China.\n\nLast week, two cases were reported in Thailand and one in Japan. All three involved people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city.\n\nA report by London Imperial College's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis estimated that by Jan. 12 there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan City with onset of related symptoms. Chinese health authorities have not commented directly on the report.\n\n\"This outbreak is extremely concerning. Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it is now clear that there is person to person transmission,\" Farrar said.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday \"an animal source\" appeared most likely to be the primary source of the outbreak and that some \"limited human-to-human transmission\" occurred between close contacts.\n\nThe Geneva-based U.N. agency later convened an emergency committee for Wednesday to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken to manage it.\n\nSo far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions, but a panel of independent experts could do so or make other recommendations to limit spread.\n\nChina's state council reiterated the government will step up prevention efforts and find the source of infection and transmission channels as soon as possible, state television said on Monday.\n\nShares in pharmaceutical firms and mask makers in China surged Monday because of the outbreak.\n\n\"Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?,\" said one commentator on Chinese social media platform Weibo\n\nThe state-run Global Times newspaper said in an editorial the government needs to disclose all information and not repeat the mistakes made with SARS. Chinese officials covered up the SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced it to reveal the epidemic.\n\n\"Concealment would be a serious blow to the government's credibility and might trigger greater social panic,\" the editorial said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

cushioning results for American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N), the two said on Thursday, while warning they are losing customers as their Boeing 737 MAX jets remain parked in a global grounding.\n\nAmerican and Southwest, the two largest U.S. operators of Boeing Co's (BA.N) 737 MAX aircraft that has been grounded since March following two deadly crashes, said they do not have enough aircraft to meet the demand they see in the market.\n\nBoth airlines have canceled flights into early June as they operate slimmer fleets but said on Thursday that cancellations would likely extend into the summer or fall after Boeing signaled this week that it does not expect to win regulatory approval for the jets to fly again until mid-year.\n\nSouthwest CEO Gary Kelly said the airline is losing 6 million to 7 million customers a year due to the 737 MAX grounding, but said he expects to \"aggressively recapture\" lost market share once the jets return.\n\n\"There's a lot of pent-up demand for traveling on American. We're not going to be able to meet it all,\" American CEO Doug Parker told CNBC. \"It's going to unfortunately go to some of our competitors.\"\n\nEven without the MAX, both airlines reported solid quarterly profits and pointed to strong first-quarter bookings.\n\nShares of American Airlines gained 2.6% to $28.03 while Southwest shares were up 3.5% at $55.35.\n\nAfter regulators give the green light, airlines will still need a month or longer to prepare the jets and their pilots.\n\nFor Southwest, the world's largest 737 MAX operator with nearly 10,000 pilots, the training process will take at least a couple of months more than the 30 days that it initially expected now that Boeing is recommending simulator training rather than just computer based training.\n\nParker said it was too soon to see any impact from the coronavirus that has emerged from Wuhan, China, but said the carrier is working with U.S. public health officials. In response to the outbreak, passengers are being screened as a precaution at airports around the world.\n\nSouthwest does not fly to Asia.\n\nFor 2020, American said it expects 2020 full-year adjusted earnings between $4 and $6 per share, an estimate some analysts said they thought was conservative.\n\nSouthwest, which had bet its entire growth strategy on the 737 MAX, did not provide 2020 guidance given continued uncertainty around when the jets will fly again.\n\nBoth companies struck partial compensation deals with Boeing over 737 MAX damages in 2019 and said they expect additional settlements this year.\n\nSmaller U.S. airline JetBlue also posted quarterly earnings on Thursday that showed it delivering on a three-year cost-cutting drive, sending its shares higher.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Group", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAX_Light_Rail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MAX Light Rail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_simulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight simulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBlue", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JetBlue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200123&t=2&i=1480319223&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG0M1MO", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 4897}, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 4897, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1416190926", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-20", "time": "01:40:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-20T01:40:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-20T01:22:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-factbox-idUSKBN1ZJ039", "title": "Factbox: What we know about the new coronavirus spreading in China...", "body": "(Reuters) - At least nine people have died from a new coronavirus in China following an outbreak in the city of Wuhan and more than 470 cases have been reported globally, most in China.\n\nGlobal health authorities fear the transmission rate will accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nChina confirmed 473 cases as of Jan 21, according to the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper.\n\nThailand reported four cases, and South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the United States one each. All involved residents of Wuhan or recent visitors to the city.\n\nChinese authorities are trying to determine the origin of the virus, which they say came from a market in Wuhan where wildlife was traded illegally. The World Health Organization (WHO) says an animal appears most likely to be the primary source.\n\nChina's National Health Commission Vice Minister Li Bin told reporters there was evidence of respiratory transmission of the virus from patient to patient. Chinese authorities say 15 medical staff have been infected.\n\nSome experts say the virus may not be as deadly as other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people during a 2002-2003 outbreak also originating from China.\n\nCOUNTER-MEASURES\n\nThere is no vaccine for the new virus, which China says is mutating. Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.\n\nChinese authorities have stepped up monitoring and disinfection efforts ahead of the Lunar New Year break that starts on Jan. 24.\n\nThey have also advised people to not travel to Wuhan and also asked Wuhan residents to remain there.\n\nAirports in the United States and Britain, as well as many Asian countries, including Japan, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea, stepped up screening of passengers from Wuhan. Russia strengthened sanitary and quarantine controls at entry points.\n\nTaiwan advised people not to visit Wuhan unless absolutely necessary and suspended Wuhan tourist groups from visiting the island.\n\nThe WHO sent directives to hospitals around the world on infection prevention and control. An emergency committee of experts met on Wednesday in Geneva to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international emergency.\n\nPUBLIC, COMPANIES REACT While the WHO has yet to recommend trade or travel restrictions, some Chinese travel booking platforms and airlines have offered free cancellations for Wuhan trips. Beyond Wuhan, some Chinese have begun cancelling travel plans for the Lunar New Year and avoiding public areas like cinemas and shopping centres. Companies are handing out masks and warning staff to avoid Wuhan. Shanghai's Disneyland will waive some rescheduling fees for customers who change travel plans. Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK) will let passengers to Wuhan change or cancel flights without charge through Feb. 15 and permit cabin crew to wear masks on flights to the mainland.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transmission (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 61}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 15}], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-5439077", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 3599}, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 3599, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1420106619", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-01-23", "time": "02:36:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-23T02:36:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-23T02:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN1ZM09X", "title": "Oil falls 3% as specter of China virus threatens fuel demand", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell 3% on Thursday on concern that the spread of a virus from China could lower fuel demand if it stunts economic growth, but losses were limited by a drawdown in U.S. crude inventories.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures fell $1.70, or 2.7%, to $61.51 a barrel by 1:03 p.m. EST (1803 GMT).

Australia will begin screening passengers arriving from a Chinese city in a bid to stop the spread of a new virus, the country's chief medical officer said on Tuesday, although authorities warned that an outbreak would be hard to prevent.\n\nChinese authorities have confirmed more than 200 people have caught the coronavirus, which can cause a type of pneumonia that has killed four people in the central city of Wuhan.\n\nThe virus - which can pass from person to person - broke out in Wuhan but four cases have been reported in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, raising concerns about its spread through international air travel.\n\nBrendan Murphy, the chief medical officer for the Australian government, said biosecurity officials would begin screening passengers arriving on the three weekly flights to Sydney from Wuhan starting on Thursday.\n\nPassengers would be given an information pamphlet and asked to present themselves if they had a fever or suspected they might have the disease.\n\nMurphy said the measures only offered limited protection.\n\n\"You cannot absolutely prevent the spread of disease into the country. The incubation period is probably a week,\" Murphy told reporters in Canberra.\n\n\"It's about identifying those with a high risk and making sure those who have a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention.\"\n\nChina is the largest source of tourists to Australia, with more than 1 million people arriving last year.\n\nAround 160 flights arrive in Australia from China each week, and Murphy acknowledged Chinese tourists could arrive via other locations. There are only three flights from Wuhan each week, arriving in Sydney.\n\nAustralia's additional screenings come as hundreds of millions of Chinese prepare to travel domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday that starts this week.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison urged Australians to remain calm.\n\n\"We are well prepared to respond to this situation and we will continue to monitor and take action where necessary,\" Morrison tweeted.\n\nThe government would raise its travel advisory for Wuhan to urge Australians to reconsider traveling to the city, he added.\n\nDespite the elevated risk, Murphy said Australia would not begin scanning passengers for higher body temperatures, a precaution previously used during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak.\n\nSARS killed nearly 800 people globally during the 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China, but Murphy said recent evidence indicated body-temperature screening was ineffective and

coronavirus has emerged from Wuhan, China, with more than 300 cases and at least six deaths linked to the respiratory illness believed to have emerged from animals, but with the ability to transmit person-to-person. The virus has spread beyond China's borders, raising concerns of a global pandemic.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses common in animals, including camels and bats. Most human coronaviruses, such as the common cold, typically cause mild-to-moderate illness, but some are capable of causing severe disease.\n\nThe following are coronaviruses that have caused severe major human outbreaks in the past 20 years:\n\nSARS-CoV - Cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, first emerged in 2002 in China. The highly infectious virus quickly spread to 37 countries globally. Before it was contained in 2003, the virus had infected 8,098 people and killed 774. SARS symptoms included fever, chills, and body aches and usually progressed to pneumonia. No cases of SARS have been reported since 2004, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2012, the United States declared SARS-CoV a select agent - meaning it is capable of posing a severe threat to public health and safety.\n\nMERS-CoV - The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has caused severe illness in people in more than 26 countries. The virus is thought to have emerged from camels, but it acquired the ability to be transmitted from human to human. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath, often leading to pneumonia. About 35% of people infected with MERS died, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Only two U.S. patients ever tested positive for MERS-CoV - infected healthcare workers in 2014 who had traveled to the United States from Saudi Arabia.\n\n2019-CoV - The novel coronavirus that has already infected more than 300 people in China, has been confirmed to be transmitted by people. Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus has so far spread to Thailand, Japan and South Korea. Some countries including Australia and the United States have begun screening passengers at airports who have traveled from China, particularly Wuhan. WHO officials are meeting this week to consider whether this virus should be deemed a global health emergency. CDC officials said last week it is highly plausible there will be cases in the United States.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

president-elect on Sunday offered help to rival China to fight the new coronavirus outbreak, as authorities in the island further tightened restrictions on visitors from China to prevent its spread.\n\nTaiwan has close economic and cultural links with China and has so far reported four cases of the virus, which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province and where most of the 56 deaths to date have been.\n\nBut political relations are tense. China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan, which it considers its own territory to be taken by force if needed, including holding military drills near the democratic island.\n\nThis month, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen won a landslide re-election after campaigning on a platform to stand up to China and defend Taiwan's freedoms.\n\nWriting on his Facebook page, however, Tsai's Vice President-elect William Lai said both Taiwan and China had common enemies, including infectious diseases and disasters.\n\nLai said the spread of the coronavirus in China was an opportunity for cooperation, calling on Beijing to have an \"open attitude\" towards accepting international help.\n\n\"It is incumbent upon Taiwan to take part, and help China to solve this serious epidemic, so as not to allow it to continue to spread, and that the sick can get appropriate treatment to return to help,\" he added, without elaborating on what help Taiwan may be willing to help.\n\nLai assumes his new position in May.\n\nTaiwan has been angered by its exclusion from some World Health Organization meetings on the virus.\n\nTaiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers it a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organizations as a separate entity.\n\nTaiwan has already stopped Chinese tour groups from visiting, and on Sunday banned anyone from Hubei from coming to the island.\n\nMost other Chinese citizens will not be allowed in for the time being, aside from people involved in fighting the virus or on humanitarian grounds, the island's newly established Central Epidemic Command Center said in a statement.\n\nSome Chinese business travelers will also be permitted entry, including people being re-located by multinational companies, but have to agree to have their health monitored for two weeks after entry, the command center said.\n\nSpouses married to Taiwanese will have to stay in quarantine at home for the same

dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. And because it is new, humans have not been able to build any immunity to it.\n\nHere is what we know so far:\n\n-There were 830 confirmed cases and 25 people had died in China, the National Health Commission said.\n\n-The previously unknown strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan.\n\n-Thailand has four cases, Singapore three, Japan, Vietnam and South Korea with two apiece, and Taiwan and the United States one each.\n\n-The World Health Organization said that while the outbreak was an emergency for China, it was not yet a global health emergency.\n\n-Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.\n\n-China says the virus is mutating and can be transmitted through human contact.\n\n-Those most affected are older people and those with underlying health conditions.\n\n-Three research teams are to start work on developing potential vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said. The plan is to have at least one potential vaccine in clinical trials by June.\n\n-Preliminary research suggests the virus was passed to humans from snakes, but Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan has also identified badgers and rats as possible sources.\n\n-Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, is under severe travel restrictions, with urban transport shut and outgoing flights suspended.\n\n-Nearby Huanggang, a city of 7 million people, is suspending public transport and closing public venues, including movie theaters and internet cafes.\n\n-Beijing closed tourist access to the Forbidden City and canceled large gatherings, including two Lunar New Year temple fairs.\n\n-Walt Disney Co's Shanghai Disney Resort will be closed from Saturday to help prevent the spread of a flu-like virus.\n\n-Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers who have traveled to China.\n\n-China's central bank said on Friday it would temporarily raise the upper limit on small bank batch payments to 500 million yuan ($72.42 million) from Friday until Jan. 30, to ease fund transfers amid the outbreak.\n\n-Asian shares held their ground on Friday after the WHO did not declare a global emergency.\n\n-Some experts believe the new virus is not as dangerous as the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has killed more than 700 people since 2012.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The patient got sick with a respiratory illness within two weeks of travel in Wuhan, China,\" Texas health officials said in a statement.\n\n\"The patient is being isolated at home in accordance with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the investigation continues to determine whether this is a case of novel coronavirus,\" the health officials said.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said the agency was coordinating testing of the individual, but cautioned that it could be a false alarm.\n\n\"Because it is cold and flu season and many people are suffering from respiratory illnesses, we expect there will be more travelers who fall under the CDC's testing guidance. DSHS will promptly announce any confirmed novel coronavirus cases. We won't provide details on negative tests,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\nAlthough Texas and CDC officials did not provide any identifying information about the patient, Texas A&M University said it had been notified by local health officials that the patient was a student there.\n\n\"Officials have described the immediate health risk to the campus community as low,\" the university said in a statement.\n\nEarlier this week a Washington state man who had traveled to the Wuhan region of China was diagnosed with coronavirus, becoming the first confirmed U.S. case. He is reported to be in satisfactory condition.\n\nThe coronavirus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, the largest city in central China with a population of about 11 million. That market has since been shut down.\n\nThough China has put millions of people on lockdown over the outbreak and U.S. officials have begun screening passengers arriving from that region, the World Health Organization said on Thursday it was too early to declare a global health emergency.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazos_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazos County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brazos County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas A&M University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200123&t=2&i=1480440008&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG0M2BJ", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1717}, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 1717, "relevance": 101}], "totalResults": 222, "page": 1, "count": 25, "pages": 9}}
