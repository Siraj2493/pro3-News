The contract fell by as much as 31% earlier in the day to $31.02, its lowest since Feb. 12, 2016.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 fell $10.15, or 24.6%, to settle at $31.13 a barrel. WTI earlier dropped 33% to $27.34, also the lowest since Feb. 12, 2016.\n\nMonday marked the biggest one-day percentage decline for both benchmarks since Jan. 17, 1991, when oil prices fell a third at the outset of the U.S. Gulf War.\n\nTrading volumes in the front-month for both contracts hit record highs.\n\nEnergy stock prices have also fallen sharply, and shale producers began cutting spending in anticipation of lower revenues. Shares for Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and Chevron Corp (CVX) fell by 10% and nearly 13% respectively.\n\n\"Over the weekend every company redid their numbers and basically shale goes into survival mode in terms of capital expenditure and activity,\" said Dan Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit.\n\nSaudi Arabia plans to boost its crude output above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in April from 9.7 million bpd in recent months, two sources told Reuters on Sunday. The kingdom slashed its export prices at the weekend to encourage refiners to buy more.\n\nRussia, one of the world's top producers alongside Saudi Arabia and the United States, also said it could lift output and that it could cope with low oil prices for six to 10 years.\n\nOPEC, Russia and other producers had cooperated for three years to restrain supply in a group known as OPEC+. Other countries in that group are likely to raise supply and cut prices to compete, adding supply to a market already awash with crude.\n\n\"The prognosis for the oil market is even more dire than in November 2014, when such a price war last started, as it comes to a head with the significant collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus,\" Goldman Sachs said.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Major milestones for big moves in light crude oil prices - here)\n\nSaudi Arabia, Russia and other major producers last battled for market share in 2014 in a bid to put a squeeze on production from the United States, which has not joined any output limiting pacts and which is now the world's biggest producer of crude thanks to a rapid rise in output from the shale sector.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Brent crude oil prices collapse by most since 1991 as 'OPEC+' disintegrates - here)\n\nThe global outbreak of the coronavirus prompted de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia to seek additional output cuts from the OPEC+ group. More than 110,000 people have been infected in 105 countries and territories and 3,800 have died, the vast majority in mainland China, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nChina's efforts to curb the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the world's second-largest economy and cut shipments to the biggest oil importer.\n\nThe International Energy Agency said oil demand was set to contract in 2020 for the first time since 2009. The agency cut its annual forecast and said that demand would contract by 90,000 bpd in 2020 from 2019.\n\n(GRAPHIC: U.S., Russia, Saudi oil output - here)\n\nMajor banks also have cut their demand growth forecasts. Morgan Stanley predicted China would have zero demand growth in 2020, while Goldman Sachs sees a contraction of 150,000 bpd in global demand.\n\nBank of America reduced its Brent crude price forecast to $45 a barrel in 2020 from $54 a barrel.\n\n\"The radical shift in policy suggests that Saudi will allow inventories to build sharply over the next three quarters,\" said a Bank of America Global Research report. \"As a result, we now expect Brent oil prices to temporarily dip into the $20s range over the coming weeks.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel Racing", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200308&t=2&i=1500529506&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG270VC", "eventUri": "eng-5586407", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 25217}, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 25217, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1476008991", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-08", "time": "22:49:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-08T22:49:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-08T22:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.843137264251709, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-idUSKBN20V149", "title": "Coronavirus fears, oil price plunge pummel world markets", "body": "NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets plunged on Monday and oil prices tumbled by as much as a third after Saudi Arabia launched a price war with Russia, sending investors already spooked by the coronavirus outbreak fleeing for the safety of bonds and the Japanese yen.\n\nA benchmark pan-Europe index entered bear market territory and a 7% slide in the S&P 500 at the open on Wall Street triggered a circuit-breaker put in place after the financial crisis a decade ago, halting U.S. stock trading for 15 minutes.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note slid as low as 0.318% - a level unthinkable just a week ago - and German government debt yields set fresh record lows as investors rushed to cut risk assets and snap up safe-havens. Gold briefly topped $1,700 an ounce for the first time since 2012 and is up more than 10% so far this year.\n\nThe rout's depth, sparked after Saudi Arabia stunned markets on Sunday with plans to hike oil production sharply following the collapse of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' supply-cut agreement with Russia, unnerved investors.\n\n\"The oil price plunge adds a huge disruptive dynamic to markets that are already very fragile,\" said Paul O'Connor, multi-asset head at Janus Henderson in London.\n\n\"We are seeing this week, finally, a full-scale liquidation and signs of capitulation, full-scale panic - we see this in every asset,\" O'Connor said.\n\nMike Loewengart, managing director of Investment Strategy at E*TRADE Financial Corp, said in an email that as markets move at breakneck speeds wide price swings are never comfortable.\n\n\"Consistent patterns of whipsawed equities and plummeting Treasury yields have certainly unnerved investors and the latest domino to fall is severe oil losses,\" Loewengart said.\n\n\"No doubt, many are taking a hard look at their portfolio.\"\n\nJim Vogel, interest rate strategist at FHN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee, said \"nobody thought that Saudi Arabia would start a price war. Suddenly you have to re-evaluate what else could impact this.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia's grab for market share was reminiscent of a drive in 2014 that sent prices down by about two-thirds, while the renewed plunge on Wall Street came exactly 11 years after U.S. stocks touched bottom during the financial crisis. [O/R]\n\nBrent LCOc1 and U.S. crude CLc1 futures slid $14 a barrel to as low as $31.02 and $27.34 in volatile trade.\n\nBoth crude benchmarks recouped some losses but still fell almost 25% in their biggest daily drop since 1991, the start of the first Gulf War. [O/R]\n\nBrent LCOc1 fell $10.91 to settle at $34.36 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 settled down $10.15 at $31.13 a barrel.\n\nThe Dow fell a record 2,000 points when trading opened and the S&P 500 posted its largest single-day percentage drop since December 2008, the depths of the financial crisis.\n\nAll three of Wall Street's major benchmarks - the Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite - were roughly 1 percentage point shy of bear territory.\n\nThe pan-regional STOXX 600 fell into bear territory from an all-time high in February. Oil stocks bore the brunt of losses, with giants BP (BP.L) 19.5% lower and Royal Dutch Shell </RDSb.L> off 18.2% as the European energy sector .SXEP slid to its lowest since 1997.\n\nThe losses in Europe amplified declines in Asia. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS lost 4.4% in its worst day since August 2015 and Japan's Nikkei .N225 dropped 5.1%. Australia's commodity-heavy market closed down 7.3%, its biggest single-day fall since 2008.\n\nInvestors piled into safe-haven debt, driving the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield US30YT=RR below 1% on bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by at least 75 basis points when policymakers meet next week. The Fed last week cut rates by half a percentage point after an emergency meeting.\n\nThe number of people worldwide infected with the coronavirus rose above 111,600, and 3,800 have died.\n\nThere were mounting worries that debt-heavy U.S. oil producers would be unable to meet financial obligations as the drop in prices slashes their revenue.\n\n\"No one expected this. We were trending downwards, but no one expected this magnitude,\" said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities in New York.\n\n\"The lower oil price is going to decimate oil stocks, the oil industry, the shale producers and the record low interest rates are going to decimate the banks,\" he said.\n\nThe European Central Bank meets on Thursday and will be under intense pressure to act, but rates are already deeply negative.\n\nThe 10-year Bund yield DE10YT=RR - the euro zone's leading safe asset - fell to a record low of -0.906%, while inflation expectations for the euro zone sank below 1% for the first time.\n\nData suggested the global economy toppled into recession this quarter. Figures from China over the weekend showed exports fell 17.2% in January-February from a year earlier.\n\nThe fall in U.S. yields and Fed rate expectations pushed the dollar to its largest weekly loss in four years before it recovered some ground. =USD.

at record low after Fed's rate cut", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets slid on Tuesday and the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell below 1% for the first time after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to shield the U.S. economy from the impact of the fast-spreading coronavirus.\n\nGold prices surged and the dollar sank as markets reacted to the Fed's surprise cut of the federal funds rate by a half percentage point, to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%.\n\nYields on U.S. government debt fell across the board as investors grabbed Treasuries and other safe-have assets, such as gold, amid the uncertainty sparked by the decision to cut rates at an emergency meeting.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement that the coronavirus would weigh on the U.S. economy for some time and he believed the central bank's action would provide \"a meaningful boost to the economy.\"\n\nThe slide in stocks and rise in safe-havens suggested markets found the Fed's action inadequate to an epidemic that has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide and threatens to significantly slow global growth.\n\n\"The Fed's pre-emptive strike against the coronavirus has backfired,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. \"The reaction has signaled to the markets that the coronavirus is on par with things like the Great Depression, the technology-media-telecom bubble bursting or the global financial crisis.\"\n\nDemand is falling and supply chains have been disrupted, symptoms that lower interest rates do not cure, Arone said.\n\nThe unanimous decision by policymakers to cut rates before their next scheduled policy meeting on March 17-18 reflects the urgency with which the Fed felt it needed to act to prevent a potential global recession.\n\nStocks on Wall Street initially spiked more than 2% on the Fed's surprise statement. But the Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq composite index and S&P 500 reversed course in afternoon trading and each closed down close to 3%.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Coronavirus hit to the world's financial markets - here)\n\nInvestors were not expecting a rate cut to come from a Fed emergency meeting, which injected unease into markets because it drew parallels to the global financial crisis, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.\n\n\"There was that run-up, then there was this recognition that maybe this is not a good idea, or even worse, maybe this is a sign that things are a lot worse than we thought,\" she said.\n\nThe fall in the yield of the 10-year Treasury to below 1% suggests diminished growth expectations, especially as the epidemic's toll on the economy is still unclear, Hooper said.\n\n\"Certainly investors should be standing ready, looking for buying opportunities, but this doesn't feel like a bottom,\" she said.\n\nThe Fed has little room to maneuver if the coronavirus deepens as a health crisis and pushes the world or United States into recession. The Fed's target was already low by historical standards before Tuesday's reduction.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said his administration was working with Congress to pass an emergency spending measure to ramp up the response to the coronavirus, adding that he expected lawmakers to authorize about $8.5 billion.\n\nThe Fed's announcement largely validated expectations from investors for aggressive policy action, said Candice Bangsund, a global asset allocation strategist at Fiera Capital in Montreal.\n\n\"It's become increasingly clear that policymakers have made stemming the damage from the outbreak a priority, which should help to place a floor under risky assets in the near-term,\" Bangsund said.\n\nShares in Europe rose more than 2% before paring about half their gains. MSCI's all-country world index also had rallied before retreating by more than 1%.\n\nThe Group of Seven finance officials said in Tokyo they would use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable global growth and safeguard against downside risks posed by the coronavirus.\n\nThe Fed's rate cut and the G7 statement came after global stocks last week suffered their worst rout in a decade on fears that disruptions from the epidemic to supply chains, factory output and global travel could seriously slow the world economy.\n\n\"The G7 is essentially trying to reassure markets but it doesn't have the ability to really impact interest rates directly,\" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.18% and emerging market stocks rose 1.10%.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.37%\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 785.91 points, or 2.94%, to 25,917.41, the S&P 500 lost 86.86 points, or 2.81%, to 3,003.37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 268.08 points, or 2.99%, to 8,684.09.\n\nGold surged. U.S. gold futures settled 3.1% higher at $1,644.40 an ounce.\n\nThe dollar slid across the board. The dollar index fell 0.4%, with the euro up 0.4% to $1.1177. The Japanese yen strengthened 1.02% versus the greenback at 107.24 per dollar.\n\nOil prices closed mixed.\n\nBrent crude fell 4 cents a barrel to settle at $51.86, off a session high of $53.90 hit immediately after the rate cut.

Health insurers, in particular, gained ground, with the S&P 500 Managed Care index .SPLRCHMO jumping 12.4%.\n\nBiden emerged as the front-runner in a narrowing race for the Democratic presidential nomination following a string of primary victories, providing relief to market participants who are wary of the more progressive policy positions of rival Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist. Sanders' embrace of a Medicare for All healthcare policy that would essentially abolish private insurance had cast a shadow on healthcare stocks.\n\n\"It's a relief to the market that it appears that Joe Biden is increasingly likely to get the Democratic nomination,\" said Oliver Pursche, vice chairman and chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York.\n\n\"Many Americans, even those inclined to agree with Trump's policies, are clamoring for a unifying voice,\" Pursche added. \"And Joe Biden is about as benign as anyone can be.\"\n\nBiden's showing acted at a balm to investors day after the market slumped following the U.S. Federal Reserve's emergency 50-basis-point interest rate cut to head off potential economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak. There are now 93,000 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide.\n\n\"(The Fed's rate cut) coming two weeks before a policy meeting signals a certain level of panic,\" said Pursche. \"We're all worried about the coronavirus and the economic impact but so far the data has held up.\"\n\nIndeed, separate data released on Wednesday showed stronger-than-expected private sector hiring, while the services sector expanded at its fastest pace in a year.\n\nAdditionally, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the average 30-year fixed contract mortgage rate fell last week to a seven-year low.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 1,173.45 points, or 4.53%, to 27,090.86, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 126.75 points, or 4.22%, to 3,130.12 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 334.00 points, or 3.85%, to 9,018.09.\n\nAll of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 posted solid advances, led by healthcare and utilities .SPLRCU.\n\nDollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) forecast underwhelming first-quarter sales and profit, sending the discount retailer's shares down 3.6%.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.34-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.64-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and 31 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 37 new highs and 130 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 11.04 billion shares, compared with the 10.00 billion average over the last 20 trading days.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"title": "Another foul day on Wall Street after surprise Fed rate cut", "body": "(Reuters) - Wall Street tumbled in a volatile session on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve surprised investors with a half percentage-point cut in interest rates, amplifying fears about the magnitude of the coronavirus' impact on the economy.\n\nAll three major U.S. stock market indexes closed nearly 3% lower after the Fed's first emergency rate cut since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe rate reduction underscored the U.S. central bank's concern about the new coronavirus, which has spread around the world after emerging late last year in China. It came two weeks ahead of a scheduled policy meeting, where traders had fully priced in a 50-basis-point cut.\n\nStocks had initially jumped more than 1%, but then dropped as traders worried whether pumping more money into financial markets would address the central problem - a drop in business activity as workers and consumers stay home.\n\n\"The rate cut underscores the magnitude of the problem that the global economy is facing,\" said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny's Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York.\n\n\"Normally, markets would welcome a rate cut, and they were hoping for it. Now that we've got it, the question is, what's next?\"\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1% for the first time ever as nervous investors moved money out of the stock market.\n\nThe S&P financials index tumbled 3.7%, reflecting banks' difficulty in making profits in low-interest rate environments.\n\nWall Street on Friday had its biggest weekly decline in more than a decade as growing cases of the flu-like virus outside China fanned fears of a global recession.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors pledged appropriate actions to support their economies.\n\n\"There is a real fear that things are going to get worse and there is no point in waiting for these fears to be realized,\" Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Chicago, said of the Fed's rate cut. \"You can always undo the rate cut if it fails to materialize.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.94% to end at 25,917.41 points, while the S&P 500 lost 2.81% to finish at 3,003.37.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite descended 2.99% to 8,684.09.\n\nLike other recent sessions, volume was heavy on U.S. exchanges, with 14.7 billion shares changing hands compared with a 9.8 billion-share average for the last 20 days.\n\nAll of the 11 major S&P sectors fell, with the information technology index slumping 3.8%. Apple and Microsoft fell 3.2% and 4.8%, respectively.\n\nTuesday's sell-off left the S&P 500 down about 11% from its record high close on Feb 19.\n\nHealthcare equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific, rose 1.8% after it launched an $11.6 billion bid for German genetic testing company Qiagen.\n\nProtective mask maker Alpha Pro Tech jumped nearly 20%.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.67-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and 32 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs

"Coronavirus concerns drag down Wall Street, but indexes eke out...", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday as fears of economic damage from the spread of the coronavirus intensified, though Wall Street's major indexes ended well above their session lows.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted its 10th decline in 12 sessions as moves to contain the virus crippled supply chains and prompted a sharp cut to global economic growth forecasts for 2020. Since its record closing high on Feb. 19, the benchmark index has lost more than 12%, wiping out $3.43 trillion from its market capitalization, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nEven so, for the week the S&P 500, along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq, posted a modest gain as stocks on Friday pared losses late in the session. Comments from Federal Reserve officials about the possibility of using other tools in addition to interest rate cuts to blunt the economic impact of the coronavirus helped stocks ease declines, said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York.\n\nNonetheless, \"it's very unclear what the economic impact will be,\" Levine said.\n\nYields on long-dated U.S. Treasuries fell to record lows as investors fled to bonds, whose prices move inversely to their yields. The drop in Treasury yields weighed heavily on shares of financial companies, which tumbled 3.3%. The S&P 500 banks index dropped 4.7%, bringing its total decline for the week to more than 8%.\n\nShares of cruise operators Carnival Corp and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd slid after Reuters reported that the administration of President Donald Trump was considering ways to discourage U.S. travelers from taking cruises. Carnival shares fell 2.6%, and Royal Caribbean shares dropped 1.2%.\n\n\"The decline today is all about the efforts to contain the spread of the virus,\" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management in Boston. \"The measures being taken could dampen commerce and consumer activity, and markets are responding to that.\"\n\nData showing a robust pace of hiring in February largely went ignored, given that the data captured little of the impact from the coronavirus. A sharp downturn in later economic and corporate earnings data would likely strike a further blow to U.S. markets, analysts said.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 256.5 points, or 0.98%, to 25,864.78, the S&P 500 lost 51.57 points, or 1.71%, to 2,972.37, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 162.98 points, or 1.87%, to 8,575.62.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 gained 0.6%, the Dow added 1.8% and the Nasdaq rose 0.1%.\n\nAll 11 S&P sectors ended lower on the day Friday, led by a 5.6% drop in energy stocks, which tracked a 10% slump in U.S. crude prices. [nL4N2AZ0SL]\n\nThe Cboe Volatility Index, known as \"Wall Street's fear gauge,\" hit its highest level since August 2015 during the session but pulled back as stocks pared losses. It ended 2.32 points higher at 41.94.\n\nStarbucks Corp shares declined 1.1% after the coffee chain said it expected its sales in China in the quarter ending in March to fall by 50% in stores open for at least a year.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corp shares fell 1.4% as it said it was struggling to keep up with demand for essentials, including disinfectants.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.77-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and 142 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 16 new highs and 542 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 14.20 billion shares, compared to the 10.54 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType":

last few years after effectively supporting opposite sides in the Syrian war.\n\n\"Russia's refusal to support emergency supply cuts would effectively and fatally undermine OPEC+'s ability to play the role of oil price stabilising swing producer,\" said Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Energy Group.\n\n\"It will gravely rupture the budding Russian-Saudi financial and political rapprochement. The result will be higher oil price volatility and geopolitical volatility,\" he said.\n\nTalks collapsed after OPEC effectively presented Russia with an ultimatum on Thursday, offering it a choice of accepting a deal with much bigger than expected cuts or no deal at all.\n\nForecasts for 2020 demand growth have been slashed but Moscow has long argued it was too early to assess the impact. Sources said Novak delivered the same message on Friday.\n\nOPEC ministers said on Thursday they backed an additional 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil cuts until the end of 2020, in addition to rolling over existing cuts of 2.1 million bpd. That would have meant removing a total of about 3.6 million bpd from the market, or 3.6% of global supply.\n\nMoscow rejected the proposal on Friday, saying it was only willing to extend existing OPEC+ cuts of 2.1 million bpd, which were due to expire at the end of March.\n\nOPEC said it was all or nothing, and hence all limits would expire at the end of the month, meaning that OPEC members and non-OPEC producers can in theory pump at will in an already oversupplied market.\n\nThe Kremlin said on Friday President Vladimir Putin had no immediate plans to talk to the Saudi leadership, an announcement that dashed hopes that a deal could be salvaged at the very top.\n\n\"This is an unexpected development that falls far below our worst case scenario and will create one of the most severe oil price crisis in history,\" said Bjoernar Tonhaugen of Rystad Energy.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in a bid to shield the world's largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus, but the emergency move failed to comfort U.S. financial markets roiled by worries about a deeper, lasting slowdown.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that the U.S. economy remains strong, but said the spread of the virus had caused a material change in the U.S. central bank's outlook for growth.\n\n\"The virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity, both here and abroad, for some time,\" Powell said in a news conference shortly after policymakers unanimously decided to cut rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%.\n\nUnderscoring how grave the central bank views the fast-evolving situation, it was the first rate cut outside of a regularly scheduled policymaker meeting since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.\n\n\"We've come to the view now that it is time to act in support of the economy,\" he said. \"I do know that the U.S. economy is strong and we will get to the other side of this; I fully expect that we will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.\"\n\nPowell acknowledged the outlook is uncertain and the situation \"fluid.\"\n\nThe pathogen, which originated in China, causes respiratory illness that has been fatal in an estimated 2% of cases, and governments and companies have shut schools and restricted travel and large gatherings in response, crimping factory output in China and disrupting production of goods worldwide.\n\nAll three major U.S. stock market indexes closed nearly 3% lower, while the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note dropped below 1% for the first time ever.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, arriving at the White House as U.S. markets closed, told reporters he had not seen the market's drop on Tuesday and was focused on the federal coronavirus response.\n\n\"I think they should do more. I think they hinted that they're not going to do much more, and that's unfortunate. He gave a very bad signal, in my opinion,\" he said of Powell.\n\nTraders believe the Fed is not done. Futures tied to the Fed's policy rate were pricing in another rate cut by June. Fed policymakers will provide their own rate path expectations, along with forecasts for economic growth, at the end of their March 17-18 meeting.\n\nJust over a week ago, most Fed officials said they expected the effects of the virus to be temporary and stuck to their view that after three rate cuts last year, the U.S. economy was well-positioned to weather shocks.\n\n\"The questions now become whether, how much, and when the Fed might deliver further monetary policy easing,\" Oxford Economics analyst Gregory Daco wrote after Powell's news conference. \"If Fed officials deem that odds of an impending recession are elevated, they'll continue to be very aggressive in cutting rates.\"\n\nWith 90,000 cases worldwide in 77 countries and territories, the virus has upended global supply chains, with companies warning daily of hits to their sales and profits.\n\nOn Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank canceled their April meetings in Washington, joining the list of organizations pulling the plug on planned events.\n\nCentral bank easing can lubricate credit markets and boost demand by lowering the cost of borrowing. But, Powell noted, it cannot repair disrupted global supply chains or convince people to fly, attend meetings or even go to school, especially if local governments or companies bar such activities.\n\n\"We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection, it won't fix a broken supply chain; we get that, we don't think we have all the answers,\" Powell said. Still, he said, it will help support \"overall economic activity.\"\n\nPowell earlier on Tuesday participated in a conference call with the top finance authorities from the world's seven largest advanced economies, which concluded with a statement that they would take all appropriate measures to support the global economy. At his news conference, he said the Fed was in active discussions with other central banks and said future coordinated action could yet occur.\n\nAlready, there has been action by other central banks. Earlier on Tuesday, central banks in Australia and Malaysia cut rates and on Monday the Bank of Japan took steps to provide liquidity to stabilize financial markets there.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin applauded the Fed's decision, saying it would help the U.S. economy. In a tweet after the Fed move, President Donald Trump kept up what has been constant pressure on the central bank to do even more. \"More easing and more cutting,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism_and_Devolution", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism and Devolution", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200303&t=2&i=1498204121&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG221D4", "eventUri": "eng-5562614", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 15855}, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 15855, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1469082604", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-03", "time": "10:18:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-03T10:18:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-03T10:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4392156898975372, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-idUSKBN20Q14O", "title": "WHO warns of global shortage of medical equipment to fight coronavirus", "body": "WASHINGTON/GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday warned of a global shortage and price gouging for protective equipment to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus and asked companies and governments to increase production by 40% as the death toll from the respiratory illness mounted.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move to try to prevent a global recession and the World Bank announced $12 billion to help countries fight the coronavirus, which has taken a heavy toll on air travel, tourism and other industries, threatening global economic growth prospects.\n\nThe virus continued to spread in South Korea, Japan, Europe, Iran and the United States, and several countries reported their first confirmed cases, taking the total to some 80 nations hit with the flu-like illness that can lead to pneumonia.\n\nDespite the Fed's attempt to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus, U.S. stock indexes closed down about 3%, safe-haven gold rose 3% and analysts and investors questioned whether the rate cut will be enough if the virus continues to spread. [.N] [MKTS/GLOB]\n\nU.S. lawmakers were considering spending as much as $9 billion to contain local spread of the virus.\n\nIn Iran, doctors and nurses lack supplies and 77 people have died, one of the highest numbers outside China.

France reported its fourth coronavirus death, while Indonesia, Ukraine, Argentina and Chile reported their first coronavirus cases.\n\nAbout 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%, but the virus can be contained, the WHO chief said on Tuesday.\n\n\"To summarize, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.\n\nHealth officials have said the death rate is 2% to 4% depending on the country and may be much lower if there are thousands of unreported mild cases of the disease.\n\nSince the coronavirus outbreak, prices of surgical masks have increased sixfold, N95 respirators have tripled in cost and protective gowns cost twice as much, the WHO said.\n\nIt estimates healthcare workers each month will need 89 million masks, 76 million gloves and 1.6 million pairs of goggles.\n\nThe coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside.\n\nThere are almost 91,000 cases globally of which more than 80,000 are in China. China's death toll was 2,946, with more than 166 fatalities elsewhere.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the Fed said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%.\n\nFinance ministers from the G7 group of rich countries were ready to take action, including fiscal measures where appropriate, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said. Central banks would continue to support price stability and economic growth.\n\nIn the United States, there are now over 100 people in at least a dozen states with the coronavirus and nine deaths, all in the Seattle area.\n\nAmid criticism of Americans not being able to get tested for coronavirus unless they met certain limited criteria, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that anyone can now get tested with a doctor's order under new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nNew York state reported its second case, a man in his 50s who works in Manhattan and has been hospitalized.\n\nThe public transportation agency in New York, the most densely populated major U.S. city of more than 8 million, said on Twitter it was deploying \"enhanced sanitizing procedures\" for stations, train cars, buses and certain vehicles.\n\nChina has seen coronavirus cases fall sharply, with 129 in the last 24 hours the lowest reported since Jan. 20.\n\nWith the world's second largest economy struggling to get back on track, China is increasingly concerned about the virus being brought back into the country by citizens returning from new hotspots elsewhere.\n\nTravelers entering Beijing from South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy would have to be quarantined for 14 days, a city official said. Shanghai has introduced a similar order.\n\nThe worst outbreak outside China is in South Korea, where President Moon Jae-in declared war on the virus, ordering additional hospital beds and more masks as cases rose by 600 to nearly 5,000, with 34 deaths.\n\nWHO officials also expressed concerns about the situation in Iran, saying doctors lacked respirators and ventilators needed for patients with severe cases.\n\nWHO emergency program head Michael Ryan said the need in Iran was \"more acute\" than for other countries.\n\nWhile the case numbers in Iran appear to be bad, he said, \"things tend to look worse before getting better.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee on Tuesday said the summer games in Tokyo set to begin on July 24 were still expected to happen despite Japan having nearly 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths.

steep sell-off sparked by fears about the coronavirus.\n\nAfter the stock market extended gains in the session's final minutes, the Dow wrapped up its strongest one-day gain since 2009, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each had their strongest one-day rise since December 2018.\n\nThat rally followed the U.S. stock market's worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, sinking into correction territory on Thursday due to fears of a recession resulting from the epidemic.\n\nThe S&P 500 remains down 8.7% from its Feb. 19 record high close. Many investors will consider the index to remain in a correction until it reclaims its high.\n\nApple jumped 9.3% in its largest one-session leap since 2008. The iPhone maker is still down nearly 9% from its record high close on Feb. 12.\n\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that Japan's central bank would take necessary steps to stabilize financial markets. That followed a similar move by Fed Chair Jerome Powell last Friday.\n\n\"We can shrug off an economic downturn, but if it starts to spill into companies' capacity to pay their debts, then that creates deeper problems. But it seems to me like the central banks are linking arms to find a way to insulate the credit markets from economic uncertainty,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.\n\nTraders see a 100% chance of a 50 basis point rate cut at the Fed's March meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 5.09% to end at 26,703.32 points, while the S&P 500 surged 4.60% to 3,090.23.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite added 4.49% to 8,952.17.\n\nTrading was very busy on U.S. exchanges, with 14 billion shares changing hands compared with a 9.5 billion-share average for the last 20 days.\n\nThe S&P 500 information technology index jumped 5.7% in its strongest session since December 2018.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management said domestic manufacturing activity barely expanded last month due to supply issues stemming from the virus outbreak.\n\n\"The Fed can cut rates all it wants, that is not going to put a person in a factory producing a product if that person is quarantined,\" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\n\n\"I don't think (monetary policy) solves the problem ... This particular one is both supply and demand, it will help but it won't fix the problem.\"\n\nCancer drug developer Forty Seven Inc soared 62% after larger peer Gilead Sciences made a $4.9 billion offer for the firm. Gilead jumped 8.71%.\n\nSurgical mask maker Alpha Pro Tech Ltd tumbled 22% but remains up over 350% year-to-date.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.69-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 18 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 149 new lows.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

ANGELES (Reuters) - Twenty-one people aboard a cruise ship that was barred from docking in San Francisco have tested positive for coronavirus, U.S. officials said on Friday, adding to the more than 100,000 cases of the fast-spreading illness across the world.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, recently appointed as the U.S. government's point man on the outbreak, said the cruise ship Grand Princess will be brought to an unspecified non-commercial port where all 2,400 some passengers and 1,100 crew members will now be tested.\n\n\"Those that need to be quarantined, will be quarantined. Those that require additional medical attention will receive it,\" Pence told reporters at the White House.\n\nThe outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people and spread across more than 90 nations, with seven countries reporting their first cases on Friday. The economic damage has also intensified, with business districts starting to empty and stock markets continuing to tumble.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday signed a bill to provide $8.3 billion to bolster the capacity to test for coronavirus and fund other measures in the United States. Cases have now been reported in more than half of the 50 U.S. states. Fifteen people have died in the country.\n\nIn many affected countries, people were being asked to stay home from work, schools were closed, large gatherings and sports and music events were canceled, stores were cleared of staples like toiletries and water, and face masks became a common sight.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said every country should make containing the epidemic its top priority, pointing to Iran's national action plan to combat one of the worst outbreaks after a slow start.\n\nIran's death toll from the virus jumped to 124, as more than 1,000 new cases were diagnosed over 24 hours.\n\nThe Vatican reported its first case, a patient in its health services, worsening the prospects of the virus having already spread further in the Italian capital, since most employees in the walled city-state live in Rome, and those who live in the Vatican frequently go in and out to the city that surrounds it.\n\nItaly is the worst-hit European country, with a death toll as of Friday of 197.\n\nSouth Korea on Saturday reported 174 additional cases from late Friday, taking the national tally to 6,767. Mainland China, where the outbreak started, reported 99 new confirmed cases but about a quarter of them came from outside the country, data showed.\n\nAbout 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, have died, far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%, the WHO said this week.\n\nMoves by some major economies, including the United States, to cut interest rates and pledge funds to fight the epidemic have done little to allay fears about the spread of the disease and the economic fallout. Supply chains have been crippled around the world.\n\n\"There's concern that while there has been a response from the Fed, given the nature of the problem, is this something the central bank can really help with?\" said John Davies, G10 rates strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in London.\n\nIn New York, JPMorgan (JPM.N) divided its team between central locations and a secondary site in New Jersey, while Goldman Sachs (GS.N) sent some traders to nearby secondary offices in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Jersey City.\n\nBank of America Corp (BAC.N) is splitting its trading force from Monday and sending 100 New York-based staff to nearby Stamford, Connecticut, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn London, Europe's financial capital, the Canary Wharf district was unusually quiet. S&P Global's large office stood empty after the company sent its 1,200 staff home, and HSBC asked around 100 people to work from home after a worker tested positive for the illness.\n\nFrance's prime minister said nurseries and schools would close for 15 days from Monday in the two areas worst hit by coronavirus infections, one north of Paris and the other in the northeastern part of the country.\n\nThe South by Southwest music and tech festival in Austin, Texas, and two music festivals in Florida were canceled over concerns about events that bring crowds of people into close proximity. The NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament was scheduled to go ahead at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore this weekend, but without spectators.\n\nSaudi Arabia will suspend public attendance at all sports events starting Saturday, the ministry of sports said.\n\nThe United Nations said it had canceled some meetings in Bonn, Germany, and elsewhere planned in the run-up to a crucial U.N. climate summit to be held in Scotland in November.\n\nYields on U.S. Treasuries plunged to historic lows on fears the outbreak will slam the global economy, and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 3.10%. [MKTS/GLOB]U.S. stocks fell but ended well above their session lows. [.N]\n\nAirline and travel stocks have been among the worst affected as people canceled non-essential travel. Norwegian Air Shuttle (NWC.OL), the hardest-hit stock among European carriers, lost more than quarter of its market value on Friday and has fallen almost 70% since the start of February.\n\n\"If this really ramps up, we could see a lot more kitchen-sinking updates from the travel industry and airlines,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

and the dollar slid on Thursday as the coronavirus spread quickly outside China, leading Britain to prepare for a significant increase in cases and France to say it appeared \"inevitable\" the outbreak would become an epidemic in the country.\n\nHSBC in London sent more than 100 staff home and Italy's UniCredit told some staff the same, while companies began issuing profit warnings. Southwest Airlines Co said it expected a hit of up to $300 million to first-quarter operating revenue.\n\nIn Britain, regional airline Flybe collapsed, making it the industry's first big casualty of the outbreak, and broadcaster ITV fell 12.0% after warning that ad revenue for April could fall about 10% as travel companies deferred campaigns.\n\nThree more people died from a coronavirus infection in France, taking the total to seven, and Britain logged its first death from the pathogen. The number of people in New York state who have tested positive for the virus doubled to 22 following a significant increase in testing.\n\n\"I thought 2020 would be the year of the election, but it turns out it's the year of the virus, and it's going to dominate everything in the global economy this year,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\nThe Institute of International Finance cut its forecast for the U.S. and Chinese economies, and warned that global growth could be the weakest since the financial crisis.\n\nGlobal growth in 2020 could approach 1%, far below last year's 2.6% expansion, the Washington-based financial industry association said. The pandemic has spread to 80 countries and has killed more than 3,000 worldwide.\n\nIn Wuhan, the Chinese epicenter of the epidemic, an expert with the country's top panel battling the illness said the city will likely see new infections drop to zero by the end of March. Total cases in China rose to 80,409.\n\nIn Italy, where the virus has hit Europe the hardest, the Civil Protection Agency said the death toll rose by 41 from Wednesday to 148, with the contagion showing no sign of abating.\n\nU.S. stocks fell sharply and European equities snapped a three-day winning streak as the epidemic's advance darkened the mood. A day earlier, Wall Street rose on former Vice President Joe Biden's strong performance in the Democratic nomination campaign and the U.S. House of Representatives' approval of an $8.3 billion funding bill to combat the coronavirus. The Senate passed the legislation on Thursday.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.89%, while emerging market stocks were little changed.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.43%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 969.58 points, or 3.58%, to 26,121.28. The S&P 500 lost 106.18 points, or 3.39%, to 3,023.94 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 279.49 points, or 3.1%, to 8,738.60.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 closed down 10.7% from its closing all-time high recorded Feb. 19.\n\nThe dollar index slipped to an eight-week low as traders bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates further, and gold prices climbed about 1.5% to the highest in more than a week.\n\nThe Fed cut rates by one-half percentage point on Tuesday. Money markets are pricing in another 25d-basis-point cut at the next Fed meeting in two weeks and a 50-basis-point cut by April.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.826%, with the euro up 0.89% to $1.1233, a 2020 high.\n\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 1.38% versus the greenback at 106.09 per dollar.\n\nU.S. Treasuries rallied as investors worried about the economic implications of increasing quarantines.\n\nCorporate mergers could shrink in number by as much as 25% this year as executives fret about the coronavirus and the impact of this year's U.S. election, said Blair Effron, co-founder of major M&A adviser Centerview Partners\n\nU.S. economic data still does not show the impact from the coronavirus. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week. Labor market strength was underscored by other data showing planned job cuts by U.S.-based employers fell sharply in February.\n\nThe epidemic's impact is not showing up in data but the storm is approaching, Kelly said.\n\n\"We have not seen the eye-wall of this storm yet. But it will gradually fade and, as it does, the global economy will pick up relatively quickly in 2021,\" he said, a consideration investors need to take into account and to not panic.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes rose in price to push their yield lower to 0.912%.\n\nOil prices edged lower, but losses were limited as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed on deeper output cuts to bolster prices.\n\nBrent crude settled down $1.14 at $49.99 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate slid 88 cents to settle at $45.90.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

on Wednesday as a strong showing by Joe Biden in the U.S. Democratic presidential primaries cheered the markets, though the economy-slowing coronavirus outbreak kept investors on tenterhooks.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden, considered less likely to raise taxes and impose new regulations than rival Bernie Sanders, rolled to victories on the biggest day of voting in the Democratic nomination campaign.\n\nThe strong showing helped U.S. stock markets bounce back from declines on Tuesday after investors deemed the U.S. Federal Reserve's surprise 50-basis-point interest rate cut to be an inadequate response to an epidemic that has so far killed more than 3,000 people worldwide and threatens to slow global growth.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 .SPX jumped more than 4%. But it was only the second gain in 10 days, and Wall Street remained in correction territory, down 10% from recent all-time highs.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 1,173.45 points, or 4.53%, to 27,090.86. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 126.75 points, or 4.22%, to 3,130.12 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 334.00 points, or 3.85%, to 9,018.09.\n\nDespite the day's rally, analysts stressed there was probably more trouble to come as the outbreak continues to worsen in countries outside China.\n\n\"I don't think the market has bottomed. I think the market will probably fall another 5% to 10%,\" said Larry Hatheway, co-founder of research firm Jackson Hole Economics. \"We're going to have to go lower because you've got a clear slowdown in activity that's probably going to last through the first half.\"\n\nBonds held on to gains after Tuesday's rate cut.\n\nThe Fed's first off-schedule move since the 2008 financial crisis came with comments highlighting both the scale of the challenge and the limits of monetary policy.\n\nBiden's success offered investors some respite.\n\n\"Seeing Biden emerge as the frontrunner sets the stage for a runoff in the autumn that pits two people who are not anti-business,\" Hatheway said, referring to President Donald Trump.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 2.68% and emerging market stocks rose 0.97%.\n\nThe epidemic continues to impact companies and financial institutions around the world. Lufthansa said it would ground 150 aircraft out of its total fleet of around 770 due to the virus, and General Electric warned it would take a hit of $300 million to $500 million.\n\nPrivate equity firm Blackstone's Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said it \"remained unclear\" if the Fed's cut would restore confidence.\n\nThe Bank of Canada matched the Fed's emergency move with a one-half percentage point cut but, as policymakers grapple with the best strategy to avoid a global recession, others have been less keen to follow suit.\n\nIncoming Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank should wait until it has more clarity on the economic impact of the virus before making any decision to cut rates.\n\nMoney markets in the euro zone are pricing in a 90% chance that the ECB will cut its deposit rate, now minus 0.50%, by 10 basis points next week.\n\nEmily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said the Fed and other central banks have a track record of supporting markets over the past 10 years.\n\n\"These moves are going to help certainly, and we look at them as a positive,\" she said.\n\nEconomic data showed the U.S. economy was in good shape prior to the Fed's cut. U.S. services sector activity jumped to a one-year high in February while the ADP National Employment report showed private payrolls gained 183,000 jobs last month.\n\n\"There's an interesting dynamic playing out, where economic growth is decent to up in the U.S., but the Fed is kind of telling you not so fast,\" said Roland.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield US10YT=RR, which falls when bond prices rise, held below 1% - not far over the overnight low of 0.9060%. The yield has fallen for 10 straight days, its longest slide in at least a generation.\n\nTen-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 5/32 in price to yield 1.0311%. With safe-haven currencies in demand, the dollar clawed back some ground. The dollar index =USD rose 0.25%, with the euro EUR= down 0.33% to $1.1134.\n\nBenchmark Brent oil prices LCOc1, which had been up 2% earlier on Wednesday, settled down 73 cents at $51.13 a barrel as Russia still resisted new steps to implement output cuts.\n\nU.S crude oil futures settled down 40 cents at $46.78 a barrel.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"},

"Coronavirus claims 3 more lives in Seattle-area as outbreak goes...", "body": "(Reuters) - Three more deaths from the coronavirus were reported by Washington state on Tuesday as the nation's largest and only fatal outbreak of the respiratory disease reached beyond the Seattle area in what appeared to be the first known instance of coast-to-coast transmission.\n\nA North Carolina resident tested positive after returning from a trip to Washington state, where the individual was exposed, and apparently infected, during a visit to a nursing facility at the center of a recent surge in cases in suburban Seattle.\n\nThe total number of people diagnosed with the coronavirus in the greater Seattle area rose to 27 on Tuesday, including nine deaths, up from 18 cases and six deaths tallied on Monday, the state Department of Health reported.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters his administration may cut off overseas travel from the United States to areas abroad with high rates of coronavirus, but said officials were not weighing any restrictions on domestic travel.\n\nA multibillion-dollar funding bill was moving slowly through Congress after Democrats raised questions about the availability of testing for the new virus.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates in an emergency move designed to shield the world's largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus as Group of Seven finance officials pledged all appropriate policy moves.\n\nThe North Carolina diagnosis, the first presumptive positive case announced in that state, was not part of the Seattle-area case cluster, which ranks as the largest concentration detected to date in the United States, and the only one yet to prove deadly.\n\nEight of those who died in Washington state were in King County and one was in neighboring Snohomish County, officials said.\n\n\"This is a very fluid, fast-moving situation as we aggressively respond to this outbreak,\" said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a public health officer for Seattle and King County.\n\nOf the 27 cases documented as of Tuesday, nine of them were connected to a long-term nursing-care facility called LifeCare in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, according to the Seattle & King County Public Health agency. Five of those who died had been LifeCare residents.\n\nThe latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed 108 confirmed and presumed cases in the United States. That tally consists of 60 reported by public health authorities in 12 states plus 48 among people repatriated from abroad, most of them from an outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan.\n\nThe number of U.S. cases beyond the repatriated patients has mushroomed from just 15 reported by the CDC on Friday, as the first handful of infections believed to have emerged from community transmission were detected in the Pacific Northwest. Before that, all U.S. cases were deemed travel-related, essentially imported from abroad.\n\nIn New York, a man in his 50s who lives in a New York City suburb and works at a Manhattan law firm tested positive for the virus, bringing the number of confirmed cases in that state to two, New York officials said.\n\nHe has severe pneumonia and is hospitalized, officials said. The patient had not traveled to countries hardest hit in the coronavirus outbreak, which began in China in December and is now present in nearly 80 countries and territories, killing more than 3,000 people.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio said confirmation of the case was made by the city's public health laboratory on its first day of testing.\n\nPreviously, all testing was conducted by the CDC, creating a delay of several days before the result was known. U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn told Congress that testing kits should be available by the end of the week that would give labs the capacity to perform about 1 million coronavirus tests.\n\nTrump said his administration was working with Congress to pass an emergency spending measure, adding that he expected lawmakers to authorize about $8.5 billion.\n\nSenate Democrats said a dispute with Republicans over the affordability of coronavirus tests and vaccinations were holding up agreement on a funding bill.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the government's coronavirus task force, was unable to answer \"vital questions\" about the availability of tests during a 45-minute meeting.\n\nStocks on Wall Street initially rose more than 2% on the Fed's surprise statement it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1% to 1.25%.

There are many other things that investors are focused on besides the jobs report this morning,\" he said.\n\nSince the end of January when the coronavirus started to make headlines worldwide, markets have sold off on Fridays as investors are unwilling to go into the weekend holding too many risky positions, Arone said.\n\n\"That pattern has held true and we're observing it in today's market as well,\" he said.\n\nThe flu-like virus emerged late last year in China and has spread to more than 90 countries, killing more than 3,400 people. Travel restrictions and factory closings aimed at curbing the virus are expected to pressure global growth, but the extent of a slowdown is hard to calculate, analysts say.\n\nStock prices have been impacted but how much and for how long earnings will be affected is unknown, said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management in Chicago.\n\n\"We just don't know the magnitude of the duration,\" she said. Supply issues already are being resolved in China, but \"the demand picture is a lot murkier as people are very rapidly changing their behavior around the world,\" she said.\n\nIHS Markit cut its U.S. growth forecast for the year to 1.8% from a previous 2.1% because of the pandemic. \"We are not forecasting a recession, but the risks have risen,\" it said.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 2.05% and emerging market stocks lost 2.62%.\n\nIn Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index fell 3.67%. Oil and gas stocks .SXEP ended more than 5% lower in their worst day in more than three years after Russia rejected a steep output cut from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The drop in Treasury yields weighed on shares of U.S. financial companies .SPSY, which tumbled 3.3% while the S&P 500 Banks index .SPXBK dropped 4.7%.\n\nThe three major Wall Street indices fell as much as 4%, but pared a good portion of those losses before the close.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 256.5 points, or 0.98%, to 25,864.78. The S&P 500 .SPX lost 51.57 points, or 1.71%, to 2,972.37 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 162.98 points, or 1.87%, to 8,575.62.\n\nFutures traders bet the Federal Reserve will slash U.S. interest rates to near zero by April.\n\nTreasury prices soared but the strong U.S. non-farm payrolls report lifted the yield a bit from their lows.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR rose 42/32 in price to yield 0.7923%, while the 30-year bond US30YT=RR rose 212/32 in price to yield 1.3167%.\n\nGermany's benchmark 10-year Bund DE10YT=TWEB yield touched a record low of 0.746.\n\nThe slide in Treasuries wiped out the yield advantage that had fueled a popular \"carry\" trade in currencies - borrowing at negative rates in the euro and yen to buy U.S. assets.\n\nOil prices tanked about 10% to their lowest levels since mid-2017.

shares of banks and travel companies taking a beating, as a new wave of fear about the spread of the coronavirus and its economic impact gripped investors just one day after election results powered a rally.\n\nThe major indexes fell over 3%. On Wednesday the market tallied huge gains following moderate Joe Biden's success in the Super Tuesday primaries for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe coronavirus has led to more than 3,300 deaths worldwide. In the United States, new cases of the vast-spreading virus were reported on Thursday around New York and in San Francisco.\n\nIn the latest developments, Alphabet Inc's Google joined other big tech firms in recommending employees in the Seattle area work from home.\n\n\"There's no way to put a framework around this, there's no way to model it, because you just don't know,\" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at Abbot Downing in Minneapolis. \"The market is clearly trading on emotion today and not fundamentals because they can't peg where the fundamentals are.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 969.58 points, or 3.58%, to 26,121.28, the S&P 500 lost 106.18 points, or 3.39%, to 3,023.94 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 279.49 points, or 3.1%, to 8,738.60.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 ended down more than 10% from its Feb. 19 closing high, after last week logging its biggest weekly percentage decline since October 2008.\n\n\"People are trying to test out a bottom, trying to decide was last Friday the bottom, at least in the near term, for this move or is there more downside ahead,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\nThe financial sector dropped 4.9% as the continued fall in Treasury yields weighed on rate-sensitive bank shares. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 0.91%.\n\nShares of JPMorgan Chase dropped 4.9% and Bank of America Corp slid 5.1%.\n\nAll 11 major S&P 500 sectors ended negative, but defensive sectors, such as utilities and consumer staples, fell less than the overall market.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, jumped 7.62 points to 39.61.\n\nShares of companies in the travel and leisure industry were punished. The S&P 500 airline index skidded 8.2%, including a 13.4% fall for American Airlines Group Inc.\n\nThe coronavirus epidemic could rob passenger airlines of up to $113 billion in revenue this year, an industry body warned.\n\nShares of cruise operators tumbled after the Grand Princess ocean liner, owned by Carnival Corp, was barred from returning to its home port of San Francisco on coronavirus fears after at least 20 people aboard fell ill. Carnival shares dropped 14.1%, while Royal Caribbean Cruises fell 16.3%.\n\nData showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, suggesting the labor market was on solid footing despite the coronavirus outbreak, with investors casting an eye toward Friday's U.S. employment report for February.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.90-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.76-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and 79 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 357 new lows.\n\nAbout 12

seeks biggest oil cut since 2008...", "body": "VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC pushed on Thursday for a bigger-than-expected oil output cut to support prices that have been hit by the coronavirus outbreak, effectively presenting its non-OPEC partners with an ultimatum to back the move or face a price collapse.\n\nOPEC's proposal to curb supplies by an extra 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of 2020 was a surprise, given the group was expected to propose cuts of 1 million bpd and, hours earlier on Thursday, had said curbs should be limited to the second quarter.\n\nBut an unusual informal meeting of OPEC ministers in a Vienna hotel on Thursday evening announced that the group now wanted the cut - already the biggest since the 2008 financial crisis - to run until the end of year.\n\nRussia and Kazakhstan, both members of the broader grouping known as OPEC+ which meets in Vienna on Friday, said they had not yet agreed to a deeper cut, raising the risk of a collapse in cooperation that has propped up crude prices since 2016.\n\nOPEC+ already has a deal in place for 2.1 million bpd of cuts.\n\nOPEC said after Thursday's formal ministerial meeting that the market faced an \"unprecedented situation\" as efforts to stop the coronavirus spreading has driven down demand for oil by dampening economic activity around the world.\n\nRiyadh, OPEC's biggest producer, has been pushing for a significant cut to lift oil prices that have tumbled 20% since the start of year. But it has struggled to win over Moscow.\n\nRussian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Thursday he was ready for a drop in oil prices if there was no deal. Kazakh Energy Minister Nurlan Nogayev, another non-OPEC producer, said talks were only focusing on extending existing curbs to June.\n\n\"Moscow perhaps is underestimating that Saudi Arabia may be ready to walk away if it doesn't get a positive answer,\" said Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects think-tank.\n\nRussia has been hesitant in previous negotiations and has then signed up to deals at the last minute. But OPEC sources have said negotiations with Moscow this time have been tougher.\n\nTwo OPEC sources said on Thursday that, if Russia failed to sign up, there was a risk Saudi Arabia would insist on scrapping OPEC production limits altogether.\n\nAfter its formal ministerial meeting, OPEC ministers had said non-OPEC states were expected to contribute 500,000 bpd to the overall extra cut.\n\nSuhail al-Mazroui, energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, said OPEC did not want to carry the burden of cuts alone and non-OPEC had to help. \"We are all in this together. So it's not going to be us making a decision alone,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, is already cutting well beyond its quota under the existing pact, reducing its output by about 10%. Russia, with bigger total production, has reduced its output by a fraction of Riyadh's cut.\n\nGary Ross, founder of Black Gold Investors, said a worst case scenario in which Saudi Arabia returned to full production would send oil prices down to $25 to $30 a barrel.\n\nThat would take prices to a level that would be painful for OPEC states, already struggling with prices at around $50, but also for Russia, which has said it can balance its books at $40.\n\n\"OPEC+ have little choice but to cut output substantially given the virus related demand losses,\" Ross said, adding that he expected Russia \"will join because it is overwhelmingly in their economic interests.\"\n\nBrent oil prices LCOc1 initially rose 0.6% on news of OPEC's plan to cut by 1.5 million bpd, but then gave up most of those gains when Russia and others suggested a deal was not in the bag.\n\nThe proposed OPEC cut of 1.5 million bpd, if approved, would bring the group's overall output reduction to 3.6 million bpd or about 3.6% of global supplies.\n\nThe last time OPEC reduced supplies on such a scale was in 2008 when it cut production by a total of 4.2 million bpd to address slower demand because of the global financial crisis.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Energy_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Energy (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Barrel Racing", "wgt": 7}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200305&t=2&i=1499008639&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG240HD", "eventUri": "eng-5566224", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 11095}, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 11095, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1474832668", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-03-07", "time": "17:39:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-07T17:39:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-07T17:38:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-italy-idUSKBN20U0RZ", "title": "Italy poised to lock down Lombardy after coronavirus jump", "body": "ROME (Reuters) -

Venice, Padua and Treviso in the region of Veneto - Asti and Alessandria in Piedmont - and the province of Pesaro and Urbino in the central region of Marche.\n\nAll schools and universities will be closed in Lombardy and the listed provinces until at least April 3. This week, the government announced schools all over the country would be closed until March 15.\n\nThe epidemic is already weighing hard on Italy's struggling economy and Rome has pledged to spend 7.5 billion euros ($8.5 billion) to tackle the outbreak and its consequences.\n\nThe decree instructs citizens to \"absolutely avoid\" either entering or leaving the areas listed, and even to avoid moving around other than for emergencies or \"essential work reasons\" within the designated areas.\n\nCafes and restaurants will be allowed to stay open as long as a distance of one meter between customers can be guaranteed.\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases in Italy, Europe's worst-hit country, reached 5883 on Saturday, the civil protection agency said, the biggest daily rise since the epidemic began just over two weeks ago.\n\nDeaths due to the highly infectious virus were up 36 to 233, the head of the agency, Angelo Borrelli, told a news conference.\n\nThe disease was first confirmed in Italy 15 days ago and remains mainly centered on northern regions, especially Lombardy, but cases have now been confirmed in each of the country's 20 regions, with deaths recorded in eight of them.\n\nOn Friday, the government approved a plan to employ up to 20,000 new doctors and nurses to respond to the emergency.\n\nLombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto represent 85% of national cases overall and 92% of recorded deaths.\n\n\"We will win this battle if our citizens adopt a responsible attitude and change their way of living,\" Borrelli said\n\nIn the worst affected areas, Italy's hospitals are under growing strain. The number of patients in intensive care rose to 567, up 23% from the day before.\n\nOf those originally infected, 589 have fully recovered.\n\nNational Health Institute chief Silvio Brusaferro said the average age of patients who have died was over 81.

While transportation and warehousing payrolls fell by 4,000 jobs last month, showing some early impact from the coronavirus, they were more than offset by strong gains nearly across all sectors, including government. The economy created 85,000 more jobs in December and January than previously reported.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 175,000 jobs in February. The economy needs to create roughly 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Employment gains averaged 243,000 per month in the last three months.\n\nThe government canvassed business in mid-February. At least 12 people have died in the United States from the respiratory disease called COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus and more than 100 have been infected. The deaths and rise in infections were recorded starting the final week of February. Overall, the fast-spreading disease has killed more than 3,000 people and sickened nearly 100,000, mostly in China.\n\nTransportation and warehousing payrolls fell likely because of travel restrictions which were enforced by some authorities to curb the spread of the illness. There have also been reports of declines in shipping container volumes at ports.\n\nEconomists believe employers are most likely to cut hours for workers initially and proceed to layoffs if the epidemic persists beyond the second half of this year and into 2021. So far, weekly applications for unemployment benefits, the most timely labor market indicator, were trending low in early March.\n\nGlobal outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday reported a sharp drop in layoffs announced by U.S.-based companies in February and said the coronavirus outbreak \"has not yet caused companies to cut positions.\"\n\nStill the virus, which causes a flu-like illness, is expected to slow job growth in the coming months.\n\nThe highly contagious virus has rattled investors, who have continued to dump risky assets such as stocks despite the Fed rate cut, in favor of safe-haven U.S. government bonds. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has dropped below 1%. Economists say fiscal stimulus is needed to cushion the economy against the disruptions from the coronavirus, though many believe financial market fears of a recession are a bit premature.\n\nLabor market strength was reinforced by steady wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in February after gaining 0.2% in January. The annual increase in wages, however, slipped to 3.0% in February from 3.1% in January as last year's large gain falls out of the calculation. The average workweek increased to 34.4 hours last month from 34.3 hours in January.\n\nThe jobless rate fell to 3.5% last month. It increased one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% in January as more people joined the labor force, in a sign of confidence in the job market.\n\nConstruction payrolls increased by 42,000 after surging 49,000 in January. Manufacturing employment increased by 15,000 jobs after falling 20,000 in January. Manufacturing has been beset by problems ranging from the U.S.-China trade war to Boeing's (BA.N) suspension in January of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner.\n\nGovernment payrolls increased by 45,000 in February, boosted by increases in state government education.

Trump administration is weighing tax relief for airline, cruise and travel industries to help such companies cope with a growing coronavirus outbreak that has dried up bookings, a source familiar with the plan said on Friday.\n\nThe move, which could include tax deferrals, is one of several targeted steps that the administration is considering to try to limit the economic damage from the epidemic, which could stifle consumer spending and keep many workers at home.\n\nWhite House Economic adviser Larry Kudlow said it was too early to determine the magnitude of the slowdown and the nation's overall economy remained fundamentally strong and was not headed for a recession.\n\nThe Labor department released strong February payrolls data on Friday, reflecting surveys taken before the virus' rampant spread outside China became apparent.\n\nU.S. officials were concerned about people who may have to stay home because of the outbreak and lose wages, as well as about small business and airlines, among others, Kudlow told reporters at the White House.\n\n\"We're worried about small business. We might be worried about small farms. We might be worried about some sectors of the economy that are really hard hit,\" Kudlow said.\n\n\"There are a lot of things we can do for cash flow purposes, possibly deferred tax purposes, and we can set up mechanisms to do that,\" Kudlow said, adding that they would be \"micro-forms of assistance.\"\n\nKudlow did not name the specific industries that could get tax deferments and a Treasury spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Washington Post first reported here that the administration is considering the idea.\n\nKudlow said the administration may have to go to Congress to seek additional funding, but aid would be \"targeted micro-forms of assistance.\"\n\n\"We are at the moment are not going to do these gigantic packages where we put in helicopter money for everyone,\" he added.\n\nThe Federal Reserve this week announced an emergency half-percentage point rate cut to try to blunt the coronavirus' impact.\n\nU.S. and global markets have slid for the past two weeks as the spread of coronavirus outside of China has raised investors' fear of the outbreak's impact as the number of cases neared 100,000 worldwide.

Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said that if founder Lee Man-hee and other heads of the church had cooperated, fatalities could have been prevented.\n\nLee knelt and apologized to the country, saying that one church member had infected many others and calling the epidemic a \"great calamity\".\n\nIt was not immediately known how many of South Korea's dead were members of the church.\n\n(For Reuters graphics on the new coronavirus - here)\n\nBut Wuhan itself, at the center of the epidemic, shut the first of 16 specially built hospitals that were hurriedly put up to treat coronavirus cases, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.\n\nThere was also a steep fall in new cases in Hubei, the province around Wuhan, but China remained on alert for people returning home with the virus from other countries.\n\nThe virus broke out in Wuhan late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, mostly in China.\n\nOnly eight cases were reported in China beyond Hubei on Sunday, the WHO said.\n\nChina's U.N.
