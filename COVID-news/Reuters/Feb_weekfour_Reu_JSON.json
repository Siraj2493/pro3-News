As of Monday's close, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrials had erased their gains for the year-to-date.\n\n\"A lot of people who have been woken up by the volatility of the stock market will start to get a little panicky,\" said Tom Plumb president of Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nAt 11:11 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 275.4 points, or 0.98%, to 27,685.4, the S&P 500 lost 31.87 points, or 0.99%, to 3,194.02 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.72 points, or 1.1%, to 9,119.56.\n\nOf the S&P's 11 industry sectors, consumer staples, up 0.1%, was the sole gainer while energy was the biggest laggard with a 1.8% dip.\n\nLast week, positive fourth-quarter corporate earnings and hopes of limited damage from the virus outbreak had pushed Wall Street to record highs.\n\nWhile some investors had been betting that support from central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve would counter any weakness resulting from the virus, this confidence was starting to dim due to worries about supply chain disruption.\n\n\"The markets are also coming around to this idea that when it's a problem with the supply side, the central banks are not equipped to deal with these kind of events,\" said Seema Shah, chief investment strategist at Principal Global Investors in London.\n\nDepartment store operator Macy's Inc fell 3% despite reporting a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly same-store sales.\n\nMastercard Inc shares fell 3.6% after announcing Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga would step down at the start of the next year and be replaced by products head Michael Miebach.\n\nHP Inc surged 7%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P, after saying it would step up efforts to slash costs and buy back stock, as it sought investor support to defend against a $35 billion takeover offer from U.S. printer maker Xerox Holdings Corp.\n\nShares of Dow-member Home Depot Inc also provided a boost, rising 0.8%, after the home improvement chain beat quarterly sales and profit estimates.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.44-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 32 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 97 new lows.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-idUSKCN20L0AF", "title": "Coronavirus threatens global economy as experts warn no country...", "body": "GENEVA/DUBAI (Reuters) - All countries need to prepare to combat the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, as authorities raced to contain the epidemic's rapid global spread and Wall Street looked set for its biggest weekly fall since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\n\nWith new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even rich nations should prepare.\n\n\"No country should assume it won't get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,\" Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe's worst outbreak.\n\nIn addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and canceled big gatherings, including sports events, to try to halt spread of the flu-like disease known as COVID-19 that emerged in central China more than two months ago from an illegal wildlife market.\n\nThe death rate appears to be around 2 percent, although it could be lower if there are many mild, undiagnosed cases, experts say.\n\nBy comparison, seasonal influenza has a case fatality rate of around 0.1%, said Anthony Fauci, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ahead of a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, who has been put in charge of coordinating the U.S. response.\n\n\"So therefore you have somewhat of a serious potential for morbidity and mortality,\" he said, adding, \"We're dealing with a serious virus.\"\n\nThere is particular concern over a case in Japan in which a woman tested positive for the virus for a second time. Second positive tests have also been reported in China and could imply contracting the disease does not confer immunity. Scientists warned that much remains unknown about this new virus.\n\nThe head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said discussions were being held with organizers about the fate of the 2020 Olympics, scheduled for July in Tokyo, although no decision was expected soon.\n\nTheir cancellation or relocation would be a massive blow for Japan, which said it was closing its entire school system for the next month in a bid to prevent spread of the virus.\n\nThe virus has so far mainly battered China, causing nearly 80,000 infections and more than 2,700 deaths, according to WHO figures. It has spread to another 46 countries, where around 3,700 cases and 57 deaths have been reported.\n\n\"This virus has pandemic potential,\" Tedros told reporters in Geneva. He said Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a \"decisive point,\" but still short of sustained community transmission.\n\nSpooked by the impact on China, the heart of corporate supply chains, and the increasing effect on other countries, stocks sank deeper into the red on Thursday and oil prices fell. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\nGlobal equity markets have dropped for six straight days, wiping out more than $3.6 trillion in value .MIWD00000PUS.\n\nThe S&P 500 .SPX finished 12% below its Feb. 19 record close, marking its fastest correction ever in just six trading days, while the Dow registered a record one-day points drop, which was also its fourth 1,000-point decline in history and the second this week.\n\nJeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, urged finance institutions to commit an initial $10 billion funds to fighting the virus.\n\n\"What we are really missing is tangible, high-level funding and support from global financial institutions,\" he said in a statement. \"The possible impact of this coronavirus is far beyond a health emergency - it's a global crisis with potential to reach the scale of the global financial crisis of 2008.\"\n\nTraders are betting the U.S. Federal Reserve will move aggressively to cut borrowing costs in coming months in response to the effects of the coronavirus on the economy.\n\nPoliticians are also scrambling to respond.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration was considering invoking special powers to rapidly expand U.S. production of protective gear, two officials told Reuters. [nL2N2AR1RK]\n\nCalifornia's governor complained that the state was monitoring over 8,000 people but had only 200 test kits.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron attempted to rally the nation as France's number of reported cases doubled.\n\n\"We have a crisis before us. An epidemic is on its way,\" Macron said.\n\nGermany, too, has warned of an impending epidemic. And Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East and beyond, announced tighter border controls.\n\nThere is no cure for the coronavirus, which can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop.\n\nIran extended closures of cinemas, cultural events and conferences for another week and called off Friday prayers in some cities. [nL5N2AR4SI]\n\nThe WHO's Ryan said Iran's outbreak may be worse than realized. It has suffered the highest death toll outside China, with 26 dead, suggesting there are likely many more cases than the 245 reported, which includes some senior officials.\n\nItaly, desperate to stave off a probable recession, warned that an \"epidemic of misleading information\" could do worse harm than the virus itself.\n\nThe coronavirus has played havoc with global aviation and tourism as airlines cancel flights, countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel.\n\nChinese authorities said the number of new deaths there stood at 29, its lowest daily tally since Jan. 28. There were 439 new cases in mainland China as of Thursday, the WHO said, compared to 746 elsewhere.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [],

- Stocks across the globe fell by the most since mid-2016 on Monday and oil prices tumbled as a jump in coronavirus cases outside of China drove investors to the perceived safety of gold and government bonds on fears of the impact on the global economy.\n\nSpot gold prices rose for a fifth straight session and touched a 7-year high while the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yield set a record low. MSCI's global gauge of stocks fell 3% and the three major U.S. indexes also fell more than 3%.\n\nDespite the spike in coronavirus cases reported in Italy, South Korea and Iran, the head of the World Health Organization said that \"using the word 'pandemic' now does not fit the facts but may certainly cause fear.\n\n\"We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.\n\nConcerns over the hit to economic growth and uncertainty over the stress to supply chains triggered selling in stocks and other high-risk assets.\n\n\"It is not as though the numbers have changed dramatically; but what has changed is the geography, which adds a new level of concern,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.\n\n\"What the market is trying to predict here is 'How large will this get globally, and when will it start to peak?'\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,031.61 points, or 3.56%, to 27,960.8, the S&P 500 lost 111.86 points, or 3.35%, to 3,225.89 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 355.31 points, or 3.71%, to 9,221.28.\n\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 3.76% with Milan's stock market down more than 5% after a spike in cases of the virus left six dead in Italy and parts of the country's industrial north in virtual lockdown.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 2.52% lower, while futures in Japan's Nikkei fell over 4%.\n\nThe virus has now killed more than 2,500 people in China, which has reported some 77,000 cases, and spread to 29 other countries and territories, with a death toll of more than two dozen outside of China, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nIran, which announced its first infections last week, said it had confirmed 61 cases and 12 deaths, with most cases in the holy city of Qom. Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan and Iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran.\n\n\"The idea that the coronavirus has been fully contained has been firmly banished,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. \"This means the economic forecasts of the impact, such as they are, will need to be revised, with a greater impact now to be expected.\"\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes last rose 29/32 in price to yield 1.3738%, from 1.47% late on Friday.

The S&P 500 .SPX gained 68.91 points, or 2.33%, to 3,023.13 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 196.66 points, or 2.3%, to 8,764.03.\n\nThe scale of losses last week - almost $6 trillion was wiped off world stocks - led financial markets to price in policy responses from almost every major central bank.\n\nFed funds futures now imply a full 50 basis point cut by the Fed at its March 17-18 meeting <0#FF:>.\n\nThe disruption to global supply chains, factory output and global travel caused by the coronavirus has worsened the outlook for a world economy already struggling with the fallout of the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nIn Paris, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned the outbreak could cause the worst global downturn since the financial crisis. In a bleak scenario, growth could drop to just 1.5%.\n\nThe OECD's outlook and the likelihood for slower growth has investors and market analysts worried the worst is yet to come.\n\n\"Nobody knows how this is going to play out,\" said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research.\n\n\"There are going to be some nasty headlines in the next few weeks about people in various countries, including the United States, getting coronavirus,\" he said.\n\nCompanies will issue profit warnings and some economic data will look scary, Clissold said, suggesting the market has not found a bottom yet.\n\nNed Davis examined previous global health scares since 2002, which registered a far lower gauge of investor sentiment, he said. An average reading was about 13, and the coronavirus reading is only 27, he said.\n\nThe epidemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei, has killed 3,000 people worldwide as authorities race to contain infections in Japan, Iran, Italy, South Korea and the United States.\n\nGold rose after last week suffering its largest daily fall in nearly seven years.\n\nSpot gold prices XAU= rose $15.0679 or 0.95 percent, to $1,599.81 an ounce.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures rose $2.37 to $52.04 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose $2.08 to $46.84 a barrel.\n\nThe dollar index =USD fell 0.759%, with the euro EUR= up 1.37% to $1.1176.\n\nThe Japanese yen JPY strengthened 0.21% versus the greenback at 107.88 per dollar.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 14/32 in price to yield 1.0816%.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Street falls more slowly as investors parse coronavirus fears", "body": "New York (Reuters) - The S&P 500 fell for a fifth straight day on Wednesday and while its decline was slower than the last few days, the session was volatile as investors reacted to headlines about coronavirus and sought to gauge its economic fallout.\n\nAfter rising as much as 1.7% in the morning, the S&P 500 hit a session low after health officials in Nassau County, New York, said they were monitoring 83 people who visited China and may have come in contact with the virus. Still, Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state has had no confirmed cases. {nL2N2AQ192]\n\nAdding to pressure was a warning from U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials that the outbreak was on a path to becoming a pandemic, according to a report.\n\nEarlier, stocks lost ground after Germany said it was heading for a coronavirus epidemic and could no longer trace all cases, and Norway confirmed its first case of the virus. For the first time, the number of new infections outside China overtook those inside the country, the source of the outbreak.\n\nTrading volume was far more active than usual, yet some investors were relieved the slide was slower. The S&P ended down 0.38%, compared with its 6.3% of losses in the previous two sessions.\n\n\"The market's default reaction function is when in danger or in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout. That's what we've seen in the past couple of days,\" said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, an independent broker-dealer in Waltham, Mass.\n\n\"The real story today was that it stopped going down fast ... news came in and the market thought about it and acted appropriately by selling off a little but not too much,\" said McMillan who estimates that equity investors have priced in two quarters of global economic fallout from the virus.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123.77 points, or 0.46%, to 26,957.59, the S&P 500 dropped 11.82 points to 3,116.39 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.16 points, or 0.17%, to end at 8,980.78.\n\nOf the S&P's 11 major sectors energy was the biggest laggard with an almost 3% drop, while technology was its outperformer with a 0.4% gain.\n\nMany investors were cautious about making any big bets without more clarity on the spread of the virus.\n\n\"We need to more information before markets have a further correction or get comfortable things won't escalate further,\" said Jason Draho, head of Americas asset allocation at UBS Global Wealth Management, New York.\n\n\"Markets will be very jumpy until there's increasing confidence the virus is abating and that it won't be a global pandemic,\" Draho said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, scheduled to hold a news conference on the coronavirus at 630 P.M. ET (2330 GMT), accused cable TV news channels of presenting the danger from the coronavirus in as bad a light as possible and upsetting financial markets.\n\nThe Dow ended the day 8.8% below its recent record close, reached Feb. 12 while the S&P 500 was just under 8% off its record high reached last Wednesday. Nasdaq finished 8.5% below its recent record.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.73-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 50 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 237 new lows.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges 11.86 billion shares changed hands, below Tuesday's 12.33 billion, but well above the 8.23 billion average for the last 20 sessions.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus",

soldier to be infected, as the United States warned of an inevitable pandemic, and outbreaks in Italy and Iran spread to more countries.\n\nAsian shares fell on Wednesday as the U.S. warning to Americans to prepare for a likely coronavirus pandemic jolted Wall Street again and pushed yields on safe-haven Treasuries to record lows.\n\nStock markets globally have wiped out $3.33 trillion of value in the past four trading sessions, as measured by the MSCI all-country index .MIWD00000PUS that comprises stocks across 23 developed and 26 emerging markets.\n\nThe disease is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.\n\nAdding to a growing sense that a rapid spread of the virus in more places is inevitable, a top World Health Organization (WHO) official urged that preparations be made now.\n\nIn the United States, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also urged Americans to prepare, saying that while the immediate risk there was low, the global situation suggested a pandemic was likely.\n\n\"It's not a question of if. It's a question of when and how many people will be infected,\" the CDC's principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, said on Tuesday.\n\nThe United States has reported 57 cases of the virus.\n\nDr Bruce Aylward, head of a joint WHO-Chinese mission on the outbreak, told reporters on his return to Geneva that preparations should not wait.\n\n\"Think the virus is going to show up tomorrow. If you don't think that way, you're not going to be ready,\" he said.\n\n\"This a rapidly escalating epidemic in different places that we have got to tackle super fast to prevent a pandemic.\"\n\nAylward said China's \"extraordinary mobilization\" showed how an aggressive public health policy could curb its spread.\n\nThe WHO says the outbreak peaked in China around Feb. 2, after authorities isolated Hubei province and imposed other containment measures.\n\nChina's National Health Commission reported another 406 new infections on Wednesday, down from 508 a day earlier and bringing the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 78,064. Its death toll rose by 52 to 2,715.\n\nSouth Korea, which with 1,261 cases has the most outside China, reported 284 new ones including a U.S. soldier, as authorities readied an ambitious plan to test more than 200,000 members of a church at the center of the outbreak.\n\nOf the new cases, 134 were from Daegu city, where the virus is believed to have been passed among members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nThe U.S. military said a 23-year-old soldier based in Camp Carroll, about 20 km (12.4 miles) from Daegu, had been infected and was in self-quarantine at home.\n\nIn Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for sports and cultural events to be scrapped or curtailed for two weeks to stem the virus as concern mounted for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics even though officials have repeatedly denied the Games will be affected.\n\nJapan has nearly 170 virus cases and 691 linked to a cruise ship that was quarantined this month. Six people have died in Japan, including four from the ship.\n\nThere have been nearly 50 deaths outside China, including 11 in Italy and 16 in Iran, the most outside China, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nIran's deputy health minister - seen mopping his brow at a televised news conference - was among the infected.\n\nCases linked to Iran have been reported across the region.\n\nKuwait said it had two new coronavirus cases, some among people returning from Iran, took its tally to 18, while Bahrain said its infections had risen to 26 after three new ones on a flight from Iran.\n\nIn Europe, Italy has become a front line in the global outbreak with 322 cases. Italians or people who had recently visited the country, have tested positive in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Romania, Spain and Switzerland.\n\nTwo hotels, one in Austria and one in Spain's Canary Islands, were also locked down after cases emerged linked to Italy. Spain also reported its first three cases on the mainland.\n\nChina's containment efforts have hobbled the world's second-biggest economy, with growth set to fall further from a three-decade low of 6.1% last year.\n\nBut a growing number of Chinese regions are downgrading their emergency response level after assessing that risks have receded and authorities are urging a return to work.\n\nThe effects of the outbreak are reverberating through the region with most of its major economies expected to either slow or shrink this quarter, Reuters polls found.\n\nForecasts from economists collected by Reuters on Feb. 19-25 showed that Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand are all expected to put in their worst performance in years in this quarter.", "source": {"uri":

Washington state said on Sunday a second person infected with the coronavirus had died there, while New York's governor said his state confirmed its first case of the illness.\n\nThe Washington death was in the Seattle area and was reported on the website of the Seattle and King County public health department. On Saturday, the same officials reported the first death from coronavirus in the United States.\n\nNew York state confirmed its first positive coronavirus test, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday night. He wrote on Twitter that a woman in her 30s contracted coronavirus during a recent trip to Iran and was in quarantine in her home. He did not say where the woman lived, but the New York Times, citing unnamed state officials, said the woman was in New York City.\n\n\"The patient has respiratory symptoms, but is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving in New York,\" Cuomo said.\n\nAt the federal level, President Donald Trump's administration scrambled on Sunday to reassure Americans as the disease spreads and businesses cancel conferences and flights.\n\nAdministration officials tried to calm market fears that the coronavirus could cause a global recession, saying the public had overreacted and that stocks would bounce back because of the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.\n\nWashington state on Sunday confirmed two other cases at a long-term care facility where a resident and a worker also tested positive for coronavirus and 50 residents and staff were showing symptoms.\n\nOver 70 cases have been reported in the United States, with most on the West Coast but new cases in the Chicago area and Rhode Island, aside from New York.\n\nStock markets plunged last week, with an index of global stocks setting its largest weekly fall since the 2008 financial crisis, and more than $5 trillion wiped off the value of stocks worldwide.\n\nA key energy conference in Houston that brings together oil ministers and energy firms was canceled on Sunday with the organizers of CERAWeek noting that border health checks were becoming more restrictive and companies had begun barring non-essential travel to protect workers.\n\nA world economy conference with Pope Francis due to take place in Italy later this month was also canceled.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that travelers to the United States from countries at high risk of coronavirus would be screened before boarding and on arrival, without specifying which countries.\n\nDelta Air Lines Inc said on Sunday it was suspending until May flights to Milan in northern Italy where most of that country's coronavirus cases have been reported. Flights will continue to Rome. American Airlines Group Inc announced a similar move late on Saturday.\n\nThe United States has 75,000 test kits for coronavirus and will expand that number \"radically\" in coming weeks, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said the government had contracted 3M Co to produce an extra 35 million respiratory masks a month. He urged Americans not to buy the masks, which he said were only needed by healthcare workers. Honeywell International Inc is the other major U.S. mask producer.\n\nHe also told Fox News that clinical trials of a coronavirus vaccine would start in six weeks but that a vaccine would likely not be available this season.\n\nDemocrats, who will challenge Trump for the presidency in the Nov. 3 election, have criticized his administration for downplaying the crisis and not preparing for the disease to spread in the United States.\n\nPence, whom Trump appointed last week to run the White House's coronavirus response, said Americans should brace for more cases but that the \"vast majority\" of those who contracted the disease would recover.\n\n\"Other than in areas where there are individuals that have been infected with the coronavirus, people need to understand that for the average American, the risk does remain low. We're ready,\" Pence told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nThe United States has imposed limits on travelers who have visited Iran and recommended against travel to hard-hit areas of Italy and South Korea.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that the United States was also considering shutting the country's southern border with Mexico to control the spread of the virus, adding: \"We hope we won't have to do that.\"\n\nMexico has reported four coronavirus cases. Its Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that both governments were in \"close and effective communication, especially the health authorities.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meet the Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Image Galleries", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200301&t=2&i=1497413812&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG201VR", "eventUri": "eng-5560072", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 12136}, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 12136, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1463980632", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-28", "time": "02:00:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-28T02:00:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-28T01:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9529411792755127, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-idUSKCN20M069", "title": "Global downturn looms as countries struggle to contain coronavirus...", "body": "GENEVA/BEIJING (Reuters) - The coronavirus spread further on Friday, with cases reported for the first time in at least six countries across four continents, battering markets and leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to raise its impact risk alert to \"very high.\"\n\nHopes that the epidemic that started in China late last year would be over in months, and that economic activity would quickly return to normal, have been shattered.\n\nWorld shares were on course for their largest weekly fall since the 2008 financial crisis, bringing the global wipeout to $5 trillion as supply chains were disrupted, travel plans postponed and major events canceled. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\nThe WHO said it was raising its assessment of the global risk to 'very high' from 'high', which its head of emergencies Dr Mike Ryan said was intended to put national authorities on full alert.\n\n\"I think this is a reality check for every government on the planet - wake up, get ready, this virus may be on its way and you need to be ready,\" Ryan said.\n\nThe latest WHO figures indicate over 82,000 people have been infected, with over 2,700 deaths in China and 57 deaths in 46 other countries.\n\nMexico, Nigeria, New Zealand, Lithuania, Belarus and Azerbaijan reported their first cases, all with travel history connected to epicenters in Italy and Iran. Mexico is the second Latin American country to register the virus, after Brazil.\n\nThe Nigerian case, an Italian man, is the first in sub-Saharan Africa. The man traveled through the capital and other parts of Nigeria for almost two days before he was isolated and quarantined, authorities said, underlining the difficulties already overstretched health services will have in containing the disease.\n\nPotentially making it even harder to eradicate, a growing number of discharged coronavirus patients in China and elsewhere are testing positive again, sometimes weeks after being allowed to leave the hospital.\n\nIn addition to stockpiling medical supplies, some governments ordered schools shut and canceled big gatherings to try to halt the flu-like disease. Switzerland canceled next week's Geneva international car show, one of the industry's most important gatherings.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange said it had \"robust contingency plans\" to allow it to continue operating if its floor had to close.\n\nThe outbreak appears to be easing in China, where it first emerged late last year in an market illegally trading wildlife.\n\nMainland China reported 327 new cases in the last 24 hours, the lowest in the country in more than a month, and China's three biggest airlines restored some flights.\n\nBut the virus is surging elsewhere. Countries other than China now account for about three-quarters of new infections.\n\nSouth Korea, with the most cases outside China, reported 571 new infections on Friday, bringing the total to 2,337, with 13 people dead.\n\nThe death toll in Italy rose to 21, with nearly 900 testing positive. Cafes and schools have been closed as daily life has ground to a halt.\n\nThe WHO's Ryan said Iran's outbreak may be worse than realized. Its toll of 34 dead is the highest outside China, although there are reports of much higher numbers. A WHO team is expected to be in Iran by Sunday or Monday.\n\nIn the United States, the outbreak of the new coronavirus and efforts to prepare for its possible spread have become political in a presidential election year.\n\nFederal government health officials told lawmakers the country had insufficient testing resources, a source said, and Democratic presidential candidates slammed the government's response. But the White House played down the coronavirus crisis and called the high level of news coverage a ploy to hurt U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Trump administration plans to use defense legislation to boost production of protective gear like masks and gloves, the health secretary said.\n\nOnline retailer Amazon.com joined other companies in implementing travel restrictions for its employees.\n\nJapan is scheduled to host the 2020 Olympics in July but Ryan said discussions were being held about whether to go ahead. Organizers will decide next week on the ceremonial torch relay, due to arrive on March 20 for a 121-day journey.\n\nConfirmed cases in Japan have risen above 200, with four deaths, excluding more than 700 cases on a quarantined cruise liner, Diamond Princess. Six people from the ship have died, including a man who was reported on Friday as the first British person to die from the disease.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Europe's largest coronavirus outbreak rose to seven on Monday and new cases climbed above 220 as Italy shut down much of its wealthy north to curb the disease's spread.\n\nItalian shares tumbled more than 5%, the biggest daily drop in almost four years, on worries the flare-up could cause a recession, while worried residents emptied supermarket shelves to stock up on essentials.\n\nAuthorities in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the industrial and financial heartlands of Italy, shut schools, universities, museums and cinemas for at least a week, and banned public gatherings including the famed Venice carnival.\n\nTen towns in Lombardy close to Italy's business capital Milan, with a combined population of nearly 50,000, have been placed under effective quarantine, with similar measures adopted for a small town in neighboring Veneto.\n\n\"To be honest, nobody thought the spread would be so aggressive,\" Lombardy regional governor Attilio Fontana told 102.5 RTL radio, predicting, however that the virus would regress in days due to the emergency measures.\n\nLocal authorities announced four new deaths on Monday - three men in their 80s and a 62-year-old. Three previous fatalities recorded since Friday were also elderly people. All those who have died had underlying health problems.\n\nLombardy remained the worst hit region with 172 confirmed cases, while neighboring Veneto had 33 infections, including four in Venice, which had been packed with tourists before its carnival was curtailed two days ahead of schedule.\n\nAt national level, 27 people were in intensive care, 101 hospitalized and 94 being monitored at home, officials said.\n\nEconomists warned the disruption would take a heavy toll on local businesses and Italy's blue-chip stock index fell 5.4%, with companies most at risk from an expected spending slump bearing the brunt.\n\nMotorway and airport retail group Autogrill plunged 12.7%, while high-street clothing retailer OVS fell 12.9% and luxury goods group Tod's 11.4%.\n\nItaly is the world's fifth most visited country and tourism contributes about 13% to GDP, according to the World Trade and Tourism Council. The sector is already taking a hit.\n\n\"We have been swamped by cancellations in the last few days, in restaurants, hotels, everywhere,\" said Patrizio Bertin, the head of the Veneto branch of Italy's trade lobby Confcommercio.\n\nMilan, a city of 1.3 million people, was much quieter than normal. The city's usually bustling courtrooms were deserted, normally packed bars were largely empty and even the city's imposing Gothic cathedral closed its doors.\n\n\"We were only meant to spend three days in Milan and then go to Venice for the carnival but everything is shut,\" said Russian tourist Violla Belova, 50, wearing a face mask as she took photographs of the shuttered Duomo cathedral.\n\n\"I hope we won't have to cut our trip short.\"\n\nWith other countries looking to stop the spread, Mauritius on Monday told passengers from Lombardy and Veneto just arrived aboard an Alitalia aircraft that they would have to go into quarantine if they wanted to stay.\n\nAlitalia said 40 out of the 224 passengers and crew were affected and decided to fly back home immediately.\n\nIreland said its citizens should not travel to parts of Italy affected by the outbreak. Tunisia announced it may suspend some flights to Italy to reduce exposure.\n\nPrior to Friday, Italy had reported just three cases of the virus - all of them people who had recently arrived from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the illness emerged late last year.\n\nHealth authorities were frustrated by their failure to identify how the outbreak in the north had started.\n\nDoctors say the focal point was the cluster of now closed-off towns in Lombardy, with the disease spreading fast as the first patients sought hospital attention.\n\nHowever, none of the initial patients had been to China and officials do not know who brought the infection to the area.\n\n\"By now, identifying 'patient zero' in statistical terms would be a great satisfaction ... but you understand that the situation has evolved and must be handled completely differently,\" said Lombardy official Giulio Gallera.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

President Donald Trump told Americans on Wednesday that the risk from coronavirus remained \"very low,\" and placed Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the U.S. response to the looming global health crisis.\n\nAt a White House briefing, Trump defended his administration's handling of the crisis and said health experts were \"ready, willing and able\" to move quickly if the virus spreads.\n\nTrump made his comments as public health officials warned Americans to prepare for more coronavirus cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed an infection of the new coronavirus in California in someone who had not traveled outside the United States or been exposed to a person known to have the virus, a first for the country.\n\nHow the person was infected was not known. It brought the total number of cases in the United States to 15, according to the CDC.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio called on the government to help the city obtain 300,000 extra protective masks. There were no confirmed cases in the city but de Blasio announced plans to provide up to 1,200 hospital beds if needed.\n\nU.S. stock markets fell for the fifth consecutive day on investors' alarm about the respiratory disease spreading.\n\nAt the White House, Trump said he was not ready to institute new travel restrictions for countries such as South Korea and Italy that are dealing with outbreaks - although he could not rule it out. The State Department raised its travel alert level for South Korea and urged Americans to reconsider going there.\n\nThe CDC has advised Americans to not visit China and South Korea, and on Wednesday stepped up travel warnings for Iran, Italy and Mongolia.\n\n\"The risk to the American people remains very low,\" Trump said, flanked by Pence and public health officials.\n\nHe said the spread of the virus in the United States was not \"inevitable\" and then went on to say: \"It probably will, it possibly will. It could be at a very small level, or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens we're totally prepared.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, said that while the virus was contained in the United States, Americans must prepare for a potential outbreak as transmissions spread outside of China.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the United States has 59 coronavirus cases, including 42 American passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan.\n\n\"We have to be alert to the possibility of a pandemic,\" Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in an interview.\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement that the Trump administration \"has mounted an opaque and chaotic response to this outbreak.\"\n\nShe said the House would put forward a \"funding package with transparency and accountability that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis.\"\n\nTrump is seeking $2.5 billion from Congress to boost the government's virus response, an amount Democrats said falls far short of what is needed. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called for $8.5 billion to prepare.\n\nGlobal stock markets have slumped in recent days due to worries over a prolonged disruption to supply chains and economies from the virus, which has infected about 80,000 people and killed nearly 3,000, mostly in China.\n\nU.S. stocks turned lower in afternoon trading - the S&P 500 index fell for a fifth straight day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI ended down 123.77 points, or 0.46%. [.N]\n\nTrump, who is running for a second term in the November election, has been increasingly alarmed by the drop in U.S. stock markets, which he considers a barometer of the health of the American economy and sees as important to his re-election.\n\nHe told reporters at the White House that fears of the coronavirus had hurt the stock markets. But he also blamed the Democratic presidential candidates for spooking investors.\n\n\"I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves,\" Trump said in reference to debates among the Democratic contenders vying for the right to challenge him.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump accused two cable TV news channels, CNN and MSNBC, of presenting the danger from the virus in as bad a light as possible and upsetting financial markets.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

coronavirus fears grip markets", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks and oil prices resumed their fall on Wednesday after a local authority said over 80 people were being monitored for the novel coronavirus in New York State's Long Island, adding to concern over spread in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nFinancial markets have been reacting to news of the virus' spread because of the potential impact of the disease's outbreak on the global economy.\n\nU.S. and German bond yields resumed their fall while gold prices rose.\n\nHealth officials in Nassau County, New York, said on Wednesday that they were monitoring 83 people who visited China and may have come in contact with the coronavirus, but Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state has had no confirmed cases so far.\n\n\"We need to more information before markets have a further correction or get comfortable things won't escalate further,\" said Jason Draho, head of Americas asset allocation at UBS Global Wealth Management, New York.\n\n\"Markets will be very jumpy until there's increasing confidence the virus is abating and that it won't be a global pandemic,\" he said.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 80.13 points, or 0.3%, to 27,001.23, the S&P 500 lost 5.18 points, or 0.17%, to 3,123.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.90 points, or 0.33%, to 8,995.52.\n\nEmerging market stocks lost 1.31%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.23% lower, while Nikkei futures rose 0.82%.\n\nOil prices fell after hundreds of new coronavirus cases were reported in Europe and the Middle East, while the New York state report added to the concern that energy demand would decline.\n\n\"It's still all about the virus here,\" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. \"It's going to be hard for risk assets to gather momentum.\"\n\nU.S. crude fell 2.2% to $48.80 per barrel and Brent was last at $53.53, down 2.58% on the day.\n\nThe benchmark yield on 10-year U.S. notes touched a fresh record low of 1.301% and last rose 1/32 in price to yield 1.3287%, from 1.33% late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond matched its Tuesday record low and last fell 9/32 in price to yield 1.8148%, from 1.803%.\n\nThe dollar ticked up from a two-week low hit the previous session, though moves in major currencies were muted for the most part as investors remained cautious. Sterling gave up Tuesday's sharp gains.\n\nThe dollar index rose 0.073%, with the euro up 0.08% to $1.0888.\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.14% versus the greenback at 110.38 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2908, down 0.74% on the day.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

coronavirus infections inside China - the source of the outbreak - was for the first time overtaken by fresh cases elsewhere on Wednesday, with Italy and Iran emerging as new epicenters of the rapidly spreading illness.\n\nAsia reported hundreds of new cases, Brazil confirmed Latin America's first infection and the new disease - COVID-19 - was also detected for the first time in Pakistan, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Romania and Algeria.\n\nU.S. health authorities, managing 59 cases so far - mostly Americans repatriated from a cruise ship in Japan - have said a global pandemic is likely.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who accused cable TV channels of exaggerating the danger and \"panicking markets,\" is set to hold a news conference on Wednesday evening, a likely attempt to reassure markets and the public about the government's coronavirus response. It will be one of just a handful of times that the president has appeared in the White House briefing room.\n\nStock markets across the world have lost $3.3 trillion of value in four days of trading, as measured by the MSCI all-country index .MIWD00000PUS. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\nWall Street reversed earlier gains on Wednesday afternoon and oil prices dropped to their lowest level in over a year, spooked in part by health officials saying dozens of people who had been in China were being monitored in suburbs of populous New York city - although no confirmed cases have been found.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio urged the federal government to tighten testing for visitors from a range of countries where the virus has been spreading, adding added that its eventual detection in the city was \"100% certain.\"\n\nThe virus that can lead to pneumonia is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. It has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.\n\nWhile radical quarantining measures have helped slow the rate of transmission in China, it is accelerating elsewhere.\n\nGermany, which has around 20 cases, said it was already impossible to trace all chains of infection, and Health Minister Jens Spahn urged regional authorities, hospitals and employers to review their pandemic planning.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said China had reported 412 new cases on Tuesday, while there were 459 in 37 other countries.\n\nHowever, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus advised diplomats in Geneva on Wednesday against speaking of a pandemic - which the WHO defines as the worldwide spread of a new disease.\n\n\"Using the word pandemic carelessly has no tangible benefit, but it does have significant risk in terms of amplifying unnecessary and unjustified fear and stigma, and paralyzing systems,\" he said. \"It may also signal that we can no longer contain the virus, which is not true.\"\n\nThe WHO says the outbreak peaked in China around Feb. 2, after measures that included isolating its epicenter Hubei province. It said only 10 new cases were reported in China on Tuesday outside Hubei.\n\nLatin America's first case was in a 61-year-old man in Sao Paulo, Brazil, who had recently visited Italy, a new front line in the global outbreak.\n\nThe diagnosis coincided with the carnival holiday, a peak time for domestic travel. Brazil's stock index fell over 7%.\n\nIn addition to Brazil, Italians or people who recently visited Italy have tested positive in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Greece, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Italy itself has reported more than 400 cases, centered on the industrial heartlands of Lombardy and Veneto.\n\nA hotel in Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands was locked down over cases linked to Italy.\n\n\"It's very scary because everyone is out, in the pool, spreading the virus,\" said 45-year-old hotel guest Lara Pennington.\n\nIn France, a second person died - a teacher who had not visited any country with a known outbreak.\n\nIn Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for sports and cultural events to be scrapped or curtailed for two weeks to stem the virus as concern mounted for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nJapan has nearly 170 cases besides the 691 linked to the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined off its coast this month.\n\nThere have been nearly 50 deaths outside China, including 12 in Italy and 19 in Iran, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nWhile Iran has reported only 139 cases, epidemiologists say the death rate of around 2% seen elsewhere suggest that the true number of cases must be many times higher.\n\nCases linked to Iran have been reported across the Middle East. Iraq imposed travel bans to affected countries and barred public gatherings.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, sending markets into a tailspin over fears of a global pandemic even as China eased curbs with no new cases reported in Beijing and other cities.\n\nWhile health experts have expected limited outbreaks beyond China, the rapid acceleration of cases in Italy going from three on Friday to 220 on Monday is concerning, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.\n\nJust as China put cities on lockdown, Italian authorities sealed off the worst-affected towns, closed schools and halted the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases.\n\nShops are shut, bars are closed and people speak to each other from a safe distance in northern Italy.\n\nMarkets are nervous that Europe could experience disruptions similar to China, where air traffic has been disrupted and global supply chains rattled for everything from medicine to cars to smartphones.\n\nBut China's actions, especially in Wuhan - the epicenter of the outbreak - probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases, said the head of the WHO delegation in China, Bruce Aylward, urging the rest of the world to learn the lesson of acting fast.\n\n\"They're at a point now where the number of cured people coming out of hospitals each day is much more than the sick going in,\" he said.\n\nThe surge of cases outside mainland China triggered sharp falls in global markets as investors fled to safe havens. European equities markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016, gold soared to a seven-year high and oil tumbled 4%.[MKTS/GLOB][.N]\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day percentage drops in over two years and Nasdaq had one of its worst days since December 2018. All three indexes closed down more than 3% after notching record highs last week on optimism the coronavirus would not seriously hurt global economies. [.N]\n\nWall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index , jumped to a one-year high.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the word \"pandemic\" did yet not fit the facts.\n\n\"We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,\" he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.\n\nThe epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since, the WHO said.\n\nDr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO's emergencies program, told reporters it was still possible to contain the virus and that it might appear each year like the flu.\n\n\"The virus may settle down into an endemic pattern of transmission, into a seasonal pattern of transmission, or it could accelerate into a full-blown global pandemic,\" he said in Geneva on Monday. \"And at this point, it is not possible to say which of those realities is going to happen.\"\n\nIn the United States, the White House is considering asking lawmakers for emergency funding to ramp up its response to the fast-spreading virus, a White House spokesman and an administration source said on Monday. Politico and the Washington Post had reported the Trump administration may request $1 billion.\n\nLiang Wannian of China's National Health Commission said while the rapid rise had been halted, the situation was still grim. He said over 3,000 medical staff had become infected, most in Hubei province surrounding Wuhan, probably due to the lack of protective gear and fatigue.\n\nExcluding Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases, the lowest since the national health authority started publishing nationwide daily figures on Jan. 20.\n\nOverall, China reported 409 new cases on the mainland, down from 648 a day earlier. That took the total number of cases to 77,150, while the death toll rose by 150 to 2,592.\n\nThere was a measure of relief for the world's second-largest economy as more than 20 province-level jurisdictions, including Beijing and Shanghai, reported zero new infections.\n\nOutside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to some 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nSouth Korea reported 231 new cases, taking its total to 833. Many are in its fourth-largest city, Daegu, which became more isolated with Asiana Airlines (020560.KS) and Korean Air (003490.KS) suspending flights there until next month.\n\nKuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan and Iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran, where the toll was 12 dead and 61 infected. Most of the Iran infections were in the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Qom.\n\nA WHO team is due in Iran on Tuesday.\n\nJapan had 773 cases as of late Sunday, mostly on the cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo.\n\nIn South Korea, drone footage here showed what appeared to be hundreds of people queuing up outside a Daegu supermarket to buy face masks.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType":

Main Street leans toward Sanders, but Wall...", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders may be surging in the polls ahead of Super Tuesday, but some on Wall Street have made their own conclusions on what November will bring: four more years of President Donald Trump.\n\nNinety-five percent of participants in a Deutsche Bank survey of investors, economists and other market participants released earlier this month said Trump, a Republican, was either \"extremely likely\" or \"slightly likely\" to win the general election.\n\nThose results contrast with some wider recent polls cited on RealClearPolitics, which show any Democrat beating Trump in a presidential contest, although top contenders have a bigger lead. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted Feb. 19-25, showed Sanders with a seven percentage-point lead over Trump in a hypothetical general election matchup.\n\nThe sharp mismatch in expectations could stoke market volatility if Wall Streeters are wrong and a Democrat emerges victorious - especially if that winner is Sanders, whose promises to break up big banks, take on drug companies and essentially abolish private insurance in favor of a single government-run plan have unnerved some investors. Many on Wall Street were unprepared for Trump's win in 2016, which was followed by sharp swings in asset prices.\n\n\"As an investor, I look at this and say the market's nightmare scenario is that Bernie or Elizabeth Warren wins the election,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, in New York. \"That's not our base case ... but it's a concern,\" he said.\n\nWarren's policy proposals, like Sanders', have also jangled nerves on Wall Street.\n\nInvestors will be looking ahead to next Tuesday, when 14 states will cast ballots and Sanders could build an overwhelming advantage if he captures the lion's share of the available delegates.\n\nThose primaries come as the markets are gripped by concerns over the economic fallout from the spreading coronavirus outbreak, with the number of cases beyond China accelerating rapidly. U.S. stocks were extending the week's losses on Friday and were on track for a 7th day in the red after the S&P 500 .SPX on Thursday confirmed its fastest correction in history.\n\nOrlando said Sanders' rise in the polls also contributed to the recent sell-off. Some investors noted that continued volatility in markets or an economic downturn could wear away at Trump's support.\n\nWhile the market gyrations are likely to drown out some of the potential impact from next week's voting results, some corners are already feeling the effects of Sanders' recent success.\n\nAfter Sanders' commanding victory in the Nevada caucuses in February, shares of insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Centene Corp (CNC.N) sold off on what some analysts said were concerns over the potential of a Sanders nomination.\n\n\"If Bernie runs the table and suddenly he becomes unstoppable, I think we're going to see the jitters again,\" said Teresa McRoberts, a portfolio manager focused on healthcare at Fred Alger Management in New York.\n\n(Graphic: Sanders nomination odds vs health insurer shares- here)\n\nThe effects on the broader market of a big Sanders win on Tuesday are less clear. Only 13% of participants in Deutsche Bank's poll believed Sanders could beat Trump in the general election, compared with 22% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 45% for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nGary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas, has kept most of his attention on the coronavirus outbreak in recent days and is not eager to make any election-related portfolio moves yet.\n\n\"I think most of my clients pretty much are like me, thinking Trump is going win,\" he said.\n\nStill, some investors believe the election can fuel market swings this year.\n\nVolume on the October futures contract VXc8 for the Cboe Volatility Index hit 16,247 between Jan. 2 and Feb. 21, according to Cboe Global Markets (CBOE.Z). That dwarfs the 471 contracts that traded in 2016 from Jan. 4 to Feb. 19. VIX futures reflect expectations for volatility in the month following their expiration.\n\nOn Thursday, October VIX futures traded at 22.5, versus 19.57 for September futures VXc7 and 20.22 for November futures VXc9, indicating heightened expectations for volatility near election day.\n\nCboe Global Markets listed October VIX futures a month earlier than usual in response to customers eager to place bets on election-induced volatility, said Kevin Davitt, senior instructor at the exchange's options institute. The exchange also listed September and November futures ahead of their usual schedule.\n\nBill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said the election will become a greater concern for investors once the Democratic party selects its nominee.\n\n\"There are a number of places where the policy divides are incredibly wide,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

(Reuters) - A growing number of discharged coronavirus patients in China and elsewhere are testing positive after recovering, sometimes weeks after being allowed to leave the hospital, which could make the epidemic harder to eradicate.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Osaka prefectural government in Japan said a woman working as a tour-bus guide had tested positive for the coronavirus for a second time. This followed reports in China that discharged patients throughout the country were testing positive after their release from the hospital.\n\nAn official at China's National Health Commission said on Friday that such patients have not been found to be infectious.\n\nExperts say there are several ways discharged patients could fall ill with the virus again. Convalescing patients might not build up enough antibodies to develop immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and are being infected again. The virus also could be \"biphasic\", meaning it lies dormant before creating new symptoms.\n\nBut some of the first cases of \"reinfection\" in China have been attributed to testing discrepancies.\n\nOn Feb. 21, a discharged patient in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu was readmitted 10 days after being discharged when a follow-up test came back positive.\n\nLei Xuezhong, the deputy director of the infectious diseases center at the West China Hospital, told People's Daily that hospitals were testing nose and throat samples when deciding whether patients should be discharged, but new tests were finding the virus in the lower respiratory tract.\n\nPaul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia who has been closely following the outbreak, told Reuters that although the patient in Osaka could have relapsed, it is also possible that the virus was still being released into her system from the initial infection, and she wasn't tested properly before she was discharged.\n\nThe woman first tested positive in late January and was discharged from the hospital on Feb. 1, leading some experts to speculate that it was biphasic, like anthrax.\n\nA Journal of the American Medical Association study of four infected medical personnel treated in Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, said it was likely that some recovered patients would remain carriers even after meeting discharge criteria.\n\nIn China, for instance, patients must test negative, show no symptoms and have no abnormalities on X-rays before they are discharged.\n\nAllen Cheng, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at Monash University in Melbourne, said it wasn't clear whether the patients were re-infected or had remained \"persistently positive\" after their symptoms disappeared. But he said the details of the Japan case suggested the patient had been reinfected.\n\nSong Tie, vice director of the local disease control center in southern China's Guangdong province, told a media briefing on Wednesday that as many as 14% of discharged patients in the province have tested positive again and had returned to hospitals for observation.\n\nHe said one good sign is that none of those patients appear to have infected anyone else.\n\n\"From this understanding ... after someone has been infected by this kind of virus, he will produce antibodies, and after these antibodies are produced, he won't be contagious,\" he said.\n\nNormally, convalescing patients will develop specific antibodies that render them immune to the virus that infected them, but reinfection is not impossible, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Sydney.\n\n\"In most cases though, because their body has developed an immune response to the first infection, the second infection is usually less severe,\" Kamradt-Scott said.\n\nOther experts have also raised the possibility of \"antibody-dependent enhancement\", which means exposure to viruses might make patients more at risk of further infections and worse symptoms.\n\nChina has so far discharged 36,117 patients, according to data from the National Health Commission released on Friday, which represents almost 46% of the total cases on the Chinese mainland. If the 14% rate of reinfection is accurate and remains consistent, it could pose a wider health risk.\n\n\"I would say that it is less about if it is possible that re-infection can occur than how often it occurs,\" Cheng said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type":

global recession, saying the public had over-reacted and that stocks would bounce back due to the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 index dropped 11.5% last week as the novel flu-like virus accelerated beyond China's borders, the worst weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nU.S. regulators who will gather on Wednesday face their most challenging week in a decade, with one official telling Reuters that coming days will determine whether the federal government has to take measures to bolster market confidence.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell sought to quell fears, stoked by dire economic data from China, flagging that the central bank would take action if necessary to support the economy, which he said remained strong.\n\nSpeaking to NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the government's response to the virus, echoed that point adding the market \"will come back.\"\n\n\"The fundamentals of this economy are strong. We just saw some new numbers come out in housing and consumer confidence and business optimism. Unemployment is at a 50-year low. More Americans working than ever before,\" he said.\n\nThe fast-spreading virus has infected around 83,000 people in more than 50 countries, with about 70 cases diagnosed in the United States. A Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health conditions was the first American to die from the virus, officials said Saturday. Authorities still do not know how he contracted the disease.\n\nNew cases were reported over the weekend in the Chicago area and Rhode Island.\n\nRebutting Democratic criticism that the administration

over-reacted and that stocks would bounce back due to the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 index dropped 11.5% last week as the novel flu-like virus accelerated beyond China's borders, the worst weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nU.S. regulators who will gather on Wednesday face their most challenging week in a decade, with one official telling Reuters that coming days will determine whether the federal government has to take measures to bolster market confidence.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell sought to quell fears, stoked by dire economic data from China, flagging that the central bank would take action if necessary to support the economy, which he said remained strong.\n\nSpeaking to NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the government's response to the virus, echoed that point adding the market \"will come back.\"\n\n\"The fundamentals of this economy are strong. We just saw some new numbers come out in housing and consumer confidence and business optimism. Unemployment is at a 50-year low. More Americans working than ever before,\" he said.\n\nThe fast-spreading virus has infected around 83,000 people in more than 50 countries, with about 70 cases diagnosed in the United States. A Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health conditions was the first American to die from the virus, officials said Saturday. Authorities still do not know how he contracted the disease.\n\nNew cases were reported over the weekend in the Chicago area and Rhode Island.\n\nRebutting Democratic criticism that the administration had bungled its response to the outbreak, Pence said the government was doing \"everything possible\" to prevent the virus from spreading and that he was \"confident\" the United States was prepared.\n\nU.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News Sunday that the public was over-reacting to the current threat.\n\nHe added that during a meeting of the White House's coronavirus task-force on Saturday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had discussed the negative stock market reaction, saying that much of it was driven by uncertainty.\n\nAzar said the administration aimed to quell that uncertainty by being as transparent as possible about latest developments.\n\n\"That's why we are trying to give the American people all the information we have when we have it so they don't think there's secret information they're not getting,\" said Azar.

"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), on Monday called the coronavirus outbreak \"scary stuff\" but said that it was no time to sell stocks despite the threat of a pandemic.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC, Buffett said investors with a 10- to 20-year time horizon and focused on companies' earnings power will fare well in stocks, and that the outbreak has \"not changed\" his long-term outlook.\n\n\"It is scary stuff,\" Buffett said. \"I don't think it should affect what you do in stocks.\"\n\nMarkets worldwide fell on Monday on concern about how the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak, which began in China and has spread to countries including Italy, South Korea and Iran, could disrupt supply chains and slow global economic growth.\n\nBuffett, however, said long-term investors should not get caught up in daily headlines, and that Berkshire would \"certainly be more inclined\" to buy stocks than on Friday.\n\n\"If you look at the present situation,\" he said, \"you get more for your money in stocks than bonds.\"\n\nHe said this was true though the U.S. economy, while sill strong, had become \"a little softer\" than it was six months ago.\n\nThe economy grew 2.3% last year but has experienced slower consumer spending and industrial production.\n\nBuffett spoke two days after Berkshire said operating profit fell 3% in 2019 to $23.97 billion, hurt by losses from insurance underwriting, while unrealized gains in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and other investments boosted net income to a record $81.42 billion.\n\nBerkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has more than 90 operating businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurer and Dairy Queen ice cream, and Buffett said the coronavirus outbreak has affected a significant number.\n\nMany of the roughly 1,000 Dairy Queens in China are closed, while those that are open \"aren't doing any business to speak of,\" Buffett said, while Johns Manville insulation and Shaw carpeting have seen supply chain disruptions.\n\n\"There's always trouble coming,\" he said. \"The real question is where are those businesses going to be in five or 10 years.\"\n\nBerkshire's stock price has trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX over the last decade, and Buffett said it will not trounce the broader market as it once did, in part reflecting its size and roughly $558 billion market value.\n\nBuffett said Berkshire over the long term is unlikely to be in the top 15% or bottom 30% of stocks, but will outperform in down markets.\n\nAny long-term outperformance \"will be minor, but it will be done in a very very safe manner,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type":

closes churches as coronavirus tally passes 3,700", "body": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Churches were closed in South Korea on Sunday, with many holding online services instead, as authorities fought to rein in public gatherings as 586 new coronavirus infections took the tally to 3,736 cases.\n\nThat came a day after the biggest daily jump of 813 cases in South Korea's battle with the largest virus outbreak outside China, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. The death toll rose to 20, up from 17 the day before.\n\nIn Seoul, the capital, about a dozen worshippers were turned away from the Yoido Full Gospel Church, which put a sermon for its 560,000 followers on YouTube, filmed with a small choir instead of all 200 members and 60-strong orchestra.\n\n\"I had heard there would be no service, but just came to check as I live nearby, but yes, it is so empty,\" said Song Young-koo, as he left South Korea's biggest church.\n\n\"It's a wise decision to do it online, since the virus would easily spread at mass gatherings and churches can be no exception.\"\n\nAuthorities have warned of a \"critical moment\" in the battle against the virus, urging people to refrain from attending religious services and political events and stay home this weekend.\n\nFor the first time in its 236-year history, South Korea's Catholic church decided to halt masses at more than 1,700 locations nationwide. Buddhist temples also called off events, while major Christian churches held online services.\n\nOf the new cases, 333 were from the southeastern city of Daegu, the location of a church at the center of the outbreak, and 26 from the nearby province of North Gyeongsang, KCDC said.\n\nThe agency said some church members in January visited the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged late last year, adding it was investigating to determine if the trip played a role in the outbreak.\n\n\"We're tracing back how many members had gone to China,\" its deputy director, Kwon Jun-wook, told a briefing.\n\n\"Our top priority is to find out how the coronavirus has been transmitted so widely among the Shincheonji followers,\" he added, in a reference to the church involved.\n\nThe numbers of cases was likely to continue growing in early March, he added, pledging greater efforts to rein in key infection sources.\n\nThe church's founder and chairman, self-proclaimed messiah Lee Man-hee, was tested for the virus on Saturday and is awaiting results, the Yonhap news agency reported on Sunday, citing a church official.\n\nCalls by Reuters to the church's headquarters in Gwacheon, just south of Seoul, went answered.\n\nBut the church issued a statement later on Sunday reiterating calls for an end to \"stigmatization, hatred and slander\" against its followers, saying it was cooperating with the government's efforts to contain the outbreak.\n\nAt a news conference in Seoul a group of doctors and chiefs of public hospitals urged the government to combat a shortage of beds by assigning them to the critically ill, after two patients died in self-quarantine at home.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in called for unity and vowed greater efforts, including an extra budget, to fight the outbreak, in a speech.\n\n\"The outbreak can threaten our lives temporarily, but it cannot break our unity and hope,\" he said.\n\nMoon proposed joint efforts with North Korea to prevent an outbreak in the neighbor and improve healthcare.\n\nNorth Korea has not confirmed cases, but has ordered a month in quarantine for those with symptoms, while state media said leader Kim Jong Un held a meeting on tougher measures.\n\nThe crisis spooked trade and financial markets, leading Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) and LG Display (034220.KS) to temporarily shut down a plant each and prompting boy band BTS to cancel a world tour set for April.\n\nMore neighbors suspended flights and banned visitors from South Korea.\n\nIn a statement, the foreign ministry said Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha asked Washington to avoid \"excessive action that could needlessly shrink exchanges between both countries,\" during a telephone call with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun on Sunday.\n\nThe request came after the United States advised Americans not to travel to hard-hit regions, such as Daegu.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news",

\"fatal mistake\" for any country to assume it will not be hit by the new coronavirus, and rich countries that might have thought they were safer should expect surprises, the head of the World Health Organization said on Thursday.\n\nThe head of the WHO's emergency programme said Iran, which has so far reported the most deaths outside of China, may be dealing with an outbreak that is worse than yet understood. He also said discussions were being held with organisers about the fate of the Olympic games scheduled for July in Japan.\n\n\"No country should assume it won't get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,\" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\n\n\"And I even say if you take Italy, a member of the G7, it was really a surprise. So even many other developed countries you also see some surprises, should expect some surprises.\"\n\nTedros said epidemics in Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a \"decisive point\": still marked by clusters of infections with some transmission in communities, but not yet by sustained community transmission.\n\nThe WHO declared the outbreak an international emergency on Jan. 30 and has been urging countries to ready screening, isolation wards and public education campaigns.\n\n\"This virus has pandemic potential,\" Tedros said. \"This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now.\"\n\nHe said U.S. President Donald Trump was right in suggesting hygienic measures similar to those to prevent flu, such as frequent hand washing.\n\nIran said on Thursday its death toll from coronavirus had risen to 26 and the total number of infected people now stood at 245, the highest number of deaths from the virus outside China. [nL5N2AR4SI]\n\nAsked about Iran's nearly 10% death rate among known cases, Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO's emergencies programme, said it was an indication that the disease might have spread further in Iran than revealed in the official figures.\n\n\"The most likely factor is obviously this disease came unseen and undetected into Iran, the extent of infection may be broader than we think,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't suspect it has anything to do with clinical care, more to do with surveillance,\" he said, adding that so far more severe cases had been detected, while milder cases would follow.\n\nRyan said the WHO was working closely with organisers of the Tokyo Olympic Games and did not believe any decision would be taken soon on whether to hold the event starting in July as planned.\n\n\"Everyone is working together to try to preserve what is a fantastically important global event,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tedros Adhanom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200227&t=2&i=1496017865&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEG1Q19Q", "eventUri": "eng-5554702", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 7171}, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 7171, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1459779685", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-24", "time": "23:44:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-24T23:44:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-24T23:40:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9333333373069763, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-idUSKCN20I2N2", "title": "Global stocks sink further as virus fears weigh", "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks sank to their lowest levels in over two months on Tuesday, as relief from a sharp selloff the previous day on fears about the spreading coronavirus proved temporary.\n\nEuropean shares recorded their worst one-day loss since June 2016 on Monday as worries about the spread of the new virus far beyond China whacked global markets and risk sentiment.\n\nOn Tuesday, the pan-European STOXX 600 index initially rose 0.6% in London [.EU] but was down 0.3% by early afternoon. Italian shares lost 0.3%, adding to their earlier losses. Italy is grappling with the worst outbreak of coronavirus in Europe.\n\nMore than 80,000 people have been infected in China since the outbreak began, apparently in an illegal wildlife market in the central city of Wuhan late last year.\n\nChina's death toll was 2,663 by the end of Monday, up 71 from the previous day. But the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since.\n\n\"In spite of increased uncertainty in Europe, signs remain good that China is succeeding in containing the outbreak there,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\n\"The number of new cases in China ex-Hubei are now at very low levels, which should allow economic activity to normalize and supply chain disruption to begin to resolve itself, in line with our base case.\"\n\nMSCI's All Country World index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was down 0.33% by 1237 GMT. The index suffered its biggest daily drop in two years on Monday.\n\nSouthern Europe's bond markets, which earlier showed signs of stabilizing, gave way to fresh selling of not just Italian bonds, but also Greek, Spanish and Portuguese debt.\n\nE-Mini futures for the S&P 500, which earlier bounced 0.7%, pared some of those gains to trade only 0.3% higher.\n\nIn Asia earlier, South Korea's hard-hit market eked out a 0.6% rise and helped MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fight back to flat.\n\nJapan's Nikkei was down 3.4%, catching up with the global sell-off after having been shut on Monday, while Shanghai blue chips eased 1.6%.\n\nEuropean and U.S. stocks have suffered their biggest loses since mid-2016 amid fears the coronavirus may be morphing into a pandemic that could cripple global supply chains and wreak far greater economic damage than first thought.\n\nThe risks are such that bond markets are starting to bet central banks will have to ride to the rescue with new stimulus.\n\nFutures for the Federal Reserve funds rate <0#FF:> have surged in the last few days to price in a 50-50 chance of a quarter-point rate cut as early as April. In all, they imply more than 50 basis points of reductions by year end.\n\nCentral banks across Asia have already been easing policy, while governments have promised large injections of fiscal stimulus, something western countries might also have to consider.\n\nData showing sales of smartphones in China tumbled by more than a third in January, underlining the potential economic impact of the virus, helped knock Apple Inc shares 3.5% lower on Monday.\n\nThe coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, feeding worries about a pandemic\n\nThe rush to bonds left yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes at 1.39%, down almost 20 basis points in just three sessions and paying less than overnight rates. Yields are rapidly approaching the all-time low of 1.321% hit in July 2016.\n\nThe sharp drop, combined with the fact the Fed has far more room to cut interest rates than its peers, kept the U.S. dollar restrained after a run of strong gains.\n\n\"Besides a tapering in the geographical spread of the coronavirus or unexpected improvements in key short-term macro indicators, the circuit breaker for these market moves is starting to move towards the U.S. central bank,\" Danske Bank said in a note to clients.\n\nIn currencies, the fell 0.2% to reach $1.0835, while the dollar lost 0.1% to trade at 110.61 yen, away from a 10-month top of 112.21.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the greenback traded flat.\n\nGold ran into profit-taking after hitting a seven-year peak overnight, and was last down 0.7% at $1,649.26 an ounce.\n\nOil steadied after shedding nearly 4% on Monday. U.S. crude was down 0.43% at $51.23, while Brent crude also lost 0.43% to $56.06.
