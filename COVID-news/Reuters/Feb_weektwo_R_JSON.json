The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all hit new peaks. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\nEven if the epidemic ends soon, it has already taken a toll on China's economy, as companies began laying off workers and other firms said they would need loans running into billions of dollars to stay afloat. Supply chains for car manufacturers to smartphone makers have broken down.\n\nThe WHO said on Tuesday 1,017 people had died in China, where there were 42,708 cases.\n\nStatistics from China indicate about 2% of people infected with the new virus have died, and many had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly. But the spread of the virus, which can lead to pneumonia, has already caused widespread disruption.\n\nSt. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said China's economy was expected to \"slow noticeably\" in the first quarter and anyone pricing assets should for now consider the \"tail risk\" that the outbreak could get worse.\n\nBut Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the financial spillover from the outbreak looked containable, though it was still early to judge the economic impact.\n\nTedros was less sanguine about the coronavirus, now officially named COVID-19 - CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the year it emerged. World health organizations wanted a name that did not refer to a location or animal.\n\n\"To be honest a virus is more powerful in creating political, social and economic upheaval than any terrorist attack,\" he said. \"It's the worst enemy you can imagine.\"\n\nThe impact of travel curbs, lockdowns and production suspensions is being felt increasingly on China's economy.\n\nJPMorgan analysts downgraded forecasts for Chinese growth this quarter and Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy predicted the outbreak would cut growth in global oil demand by a quarter this year. GRAPHIC-Comparing new coronavirus to SARS and MERS: here\n\nCisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), AT&T (T.N) and Sprint Corp (S.N) became the latest U.S. technology companies to pull out of an international telecoms conference in Barcelona because of the outbreak. The organizer of the event, the telecom industry's biggest annual gathering, will discuss whether to cancel it, an industry source said.\n\nInside China, more than 300 companies are seeking bank loans totaling 57.4 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) to help cope with the disruption, banking sources said.\n\nProspective borrowers include food delivery giant Meituan Dianping (3690.HK), smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK) and ride-hailing provider Didi Chuxing Technology Co.\n\nChinese firm Xinchao Media said on Monday it had laid off 500 people, or just over a tenth of its workforce, and restaurant chain Xibei said it was worried about how to pay its roughly 20,000 workers.\n\nHubei, where the flu-like virus emerged in China from a wildlife market in the provincial capital of Wuhan, remains in virtual lockdown, its stations and airports shut and roads blocked.\n\nWith public anger rising, Hubei's government dismissed the provincial health commission's Communist Party boss, Zhang Jin, and director Liu Yingzi, state media said.\n\nWashington, whose travel restrictions have offended Beijing, authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. government employees and family members from Chinese-ruled Hong Kong \"out of an abundance of caution,\" the State Department said.\n\nDr. Anne Schuchat, an official from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said she hoped the first group of Americans evacuated from Wuhan could be released from their quarantine on Tuesday.\n\nOff Japan's port of Yokohama, the Diamond Princess cruise ship with 3,700 passengers and crew remained quarantined, with the number of confirmed cases at 135 - the largest single cluster of cases outside China.\n\nThailand said it had barred passengers from getting off another ship, Holland America Line's MS Westerdam, though no confirmed infections have been found on board.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

closed at record highs on Monday as Chinese workers and factories slowly returned to business following a Lunar New Year holiday that was protracted by the deadly coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAll three major U.S. stock averages advanced in a broad-based rally, boosted by index leaders Amazon.com, Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc.\n\nWorries over the coronavirus kept market participants on edge, with the death toll rising to 908 and the World Health Organization (WHO) warning that new cases outside of China could be \"the spark that becomes a bigger fire.\"\n\nBut generally upbeat earnings, positive economic data and China's recent stimulus have attracted buyers to the U.S. equities market.\n\n\"The money that China injected into its economy is finding its way around the world and you have a \"buy anything and everything' mentality,\" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. \"It's an index buy and it's growth verses value.\"\n\n\"The U.S. is seeing some economic growth,\" Nolte added. \"We're the cleanest shirt in the dirty laundry, globally, and it gives investors another reason to buy U.S. stocks.\"\n\nTesla Inc's stock rose 3.1% after its Shanghai factory resumed production, and iPhone maker Foxconn re-started a key plant in China with 10% of its workforce.\n\nThat is cold comfort for Apple, whose iPhone sales in China could plunge by as much as 50% due to the virus, according to analysts.\n\nThe fast-spreading coronavirus has now caused more deaths than the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, and has affected a broad range of companies and sectors.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 174.31 points, or 0.6%, to 29,276.82, the S&P 500 gained 24.39 points, or 0.73%, to 3,352.1 and the Nasdaq Composite added 107.88 points, or 1.13%, to 9,628.39.\n\nOf the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 all but energy ended the session in the black, with technology and consumer discretionary shares posting the largest percentage gains.\n\nFourth-quarter reporting season is approaching the final reel, with 324 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 70.7% have beat Street estimates, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nAnalysts now see aggregate year-on-year fourth-quarter earnings growth of 2.3%, a reversal from the 0.3% decline analysts projected on Jan 1.\n\nMall operator Taubman Centers Inc jumped 53.2% on news that it would be bought by larger rival Simon Property Group Inc in a deal valued at $3.6 billion. Simon Property Group's shares inched up 1.4%.\n\nEli Lilly dropped 0.6% after experimental Alzheimer's treatments from the U.S. pharmaceutical firm and Switzerland's Roche failed to halt the disease.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.46-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 46 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 105 new highs and 96 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.60 billion shares, compared with the 7.66 billion average over the last 20 trading days.", "source": {"uri":

renewed Chinese demand.\n\nChina's foremost medical adviser on the outbreak told Reuters the number of new cases were falling in parts and forecast the epidemic would peak this month.\n\nBut the World Health Organization warned of a global threat potentially worse than terrorism and the WHO's chief said the world must \"wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one.\"\n\nThe WHO said 1,017 people had died in China, where there were 42,708 cases.\n\nGold fell and the dollar retreated from a four-month high against the euro as risk appetite improved, helping lift bond yields. Chinese shares closed higher for a sixth straight session as a decline in new coronavirus cases in China lifted investor sentiment around the world.\n\nMSCI's all-world stock index .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.54% to hit a record high, as did the pan-regional STOXX 600 index in Europe, the blue-chip DAX .GDAXI in Germany and the S&P/TSX Composite .GSPTSE in Canada.\n\nThe Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all set records.\n\nInvestors are not euphoric and the coronavirus has added a dose of healthy skepticism in the marketplace, said Rahul Shah, chief executive of Ideal Asset Management in New York.\n\n\"We are comfortable with stocks grinding higher, versus shooting higher.

While valuations are slightly rich, \"when you have a bull market people are going to pay more for quality names.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the U.S. economy is in a good place, even as he cited the potential threat from the coronavirus in China and concerns about the economy's long-term health.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 31.63 points, or 0.11%, to 29,308.45. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 11.31 points, or 0.34%, to 3,363.4 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 30.53 points, or 0.32%, to 9,658.92.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 closed up 0.90%, and emerging market stocks rose 1.12%. The blue-chip CSI300 index .CSI300 in Shanghai gained 0.9%.\n\nGerman shares rallied after Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) jumped 3.8% after a U.S. judge approved T-Mobile's (TMUS.O) takeover of wireless carrier Sprint Corp (S.N) in a merger initially valued at $26 billion. The German telecom giant owns 63% of T-Mobile, whose shares rose 10.8%. Sprint gained 74%.\n\nConcerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus have recently added a safety bid for the dollar, while economic data has backed the view that the U.S. economic outlook is stronger than the euro zone's.\n\nThe dollar has also gained as investors turn to carry trades, where they borrow in low-yielding currencies such as the euro and the Swiss franc and invest in dollars or other high-yielding currencies.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY fell 0.11%, with the euro EUR= up 0.11% to $1.0921. The Japanese yen was flat versus the greenback at 109.79 per dollar.\n\nA Labor Department report said U.S. job openings dropped for a second straight month in December to hit their lowest in two years, while hiring increased marginally, suggesting a recent acceleration in job growth was unlikely to be sustained.\n\nOil prices edged up from 13-month lows. Investors, however, remain wary that Chinese demand could slip further if the coronavirus spreads more than expected and if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies fail to agree on support measures.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 settled up 74 cents at $54.01 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 crude rose 37 cents to settle at $49.94 a barrel.", "source": {"uri":

Feb 24-27, is the telecom industry's biggest annual gathering, with companies spending millions on stands and hospitality to fill their order books.\n\nBarcelona's economy got a boost of around 470 million euros ($515 million) last year from the event, its organizer the GSMA estimated. The GSMA had no immediate comment.\n\nGremi d'Hotels de Barcelona, the city's main hotels association, said coronavirus concerns had resulted in cancellations but it was too early to quantify the impact on overall bookings.\n\nAnd the region's digital policy councilor, Jordi Puignero, told local radio station RAC1 the Catalan regional government was \"taking measures so that everything proceeds as normal\".\n\n\"There is no reason to not attend,\" he added.\n\nSources close to exhibitors said that if participants cancel, they would have to bear the cost. The GSMA, an industry association representing more than 750 operators and 400 companies, would only be liable if it calls off the event.\n\nSony and NTT said in statements they had withdrawn after taking into consideration the safety of customers, partners and staff. Sony said its launch event would be held via video.\n\nNTT did not immediately confirm whether its chief executive, Kazuhiro Yoshizawa, would continue as a panel speaker.\n\nU.S.-Israeli software provider Amdocs (DOX.O) also pulled out of the event on Monday.\n\n\"While we appreciate the precautionary measures put into place by the (organizer) GSMA, we believe the safest option is not to attend MWC 2020 in Barcelona,\" Amdocs' CEO Shuky Sheffer said in a statement.\n\nChinese electronics company TCL said it was cancelling a press event but would still attend MWC and showcase new devices, while Norway's Telenor (TEL.OL) said it was planning to cut the number of staff attending as well as reducing its program.\n\nGSMA said on Sunday that no-one from China's Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak began, would be allowed to attend, while visitors from China must prove they have been outside the country for at least two weeks prior to the event.\n\nThese measures add to earlier actions aimed at preventing the spread of the virus, including changing microphones between speakers and advising all attendees not to shake hands.\n\nThe death toll from coronavirus in mainland China has risen above 900, with more than 40,000 people infected. More than two dozen countries are grappling with the virus, which has infected more than 330 people outside China.\n\nIn 2019, some 6% of Mobile World Congress attendees were from China, GSMA's post-congress report showed. Most were from Europe, around 64%, as were about 45% of the exhibitors.\n\nChina's Huawei and ZTE have said they will attend, ordering China-based staff to self-isolate ahead of MWC and drafting in European staff to cover for those not able to attend from China.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Thailand has barred passengers from Holland America's cruise ship MS Westerdam from disembarking, its health minister said on Tuesday, the latest country to turn it away amid fears of the coronavirus despite no confirmed infections on board.\n\nThe Netherlands-flagged ship was sailing in a westerly direction, 96 km (60 miles) off the southern coast of Vietnam on Tuesday morning, according to data from the Marine Traffic ship tracking website.\n\nHolland America, owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp (CCL.N), had said on Monday that passengers would disembark in Bangkok on Feb. 13 and that there was no reason to believe anybody on board had the virus.\n\n\"I have issued orders. Permission to dock refused,\" Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe coronavirus that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last month has caused chaos in Asia and beyond with many flights suspended, businesses disrupted and entry restrictions imposed by governments trying to ward off the spread.\n\nIt has also roiled the world of luxury cruises.\n\nAnother cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, with 3,700 passengers and crew onboard, is quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama, with 135 cases of coronavirus detected on the Carnival Corp-owned (CCL.N) vessel.\n\nThe World Dream cruise ship was held up in Hong Kong for days after it was linked to three cases but all passengers and crew later tested negative and were allowed to disembark.\n\nThe virus has killed more than 1,000 people - all but two in China - and infected more than 40,000, most in China but including 319 cases in 24 other countries and territories.\n\nThe Westerdam had already been turned away from several countries, including Japan and the Philippines, amid fears of the virus.\n\nHolland America says no one on board has the virus. Media reports say it carries 1,455 passengers and 802 crew; its original destination was Yokohama, Japan, which refused it permission to dock.\n\n\"The ship is not in quarantine and we have no reason to believe there are any cases of coronavirus on board despite media reports,\" the company said.\n\nIt had earlier said the Westerdam was sailing toward Bangkok, and it is not immediately clear whether the ship would change course.\n\nCalls to the company's media hotline went unanswered on Tuesday.\n\nThe 285 metre (936 ft) long Westerdam can carry up to 1,964 passengers, according to the Holland America website, and is packed with cafes, restaurants and a Blues club.\n\nThe ship had already introduced extra health screening measures, including temperature checks and cleaning to defend against the virus, Holland America said in a statement.\n\nPassengers have taken to Twitter to express their frustration with the voyage to nowhere, after days at sea with no opportunity to get off.\n\n\"We have been at sea 14 days as of this Friday. We have no passengers sick in any way,\" one Twitter user who said they were a passenger on board the ship wrote.\n\nIt was not clear if the passengers were aware that Thailand had denied permission for the ship to dock.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki",

He is effectively on probation and has a matter of months to show he can revive the ailing automaker, according to three people familiar with the thinking of some on the company's board.\n\nThe mission: the new boss must prove to the board he can accelerate cost-cutting and rebuild profits at the 86-year-old Japanese giant, and that he has the right strategy to repair its partnership with France's Renault REN.PA, the sources told Reuters.\n\nThe pressure intensified on Thursday when Nissan, which has had a year of turmoil since the arrest and sacking of long-time leader Carlos Ghosn, posted its first quarterly net loss in nearly a decade and slashed its annual profit forecast.\n\nOne of the people familiar with the intentions of some on Nissan's 10-member board said an assessment of Uchida's efforts and a decision on his future would likely be made toward the middle of the year.\n\n\"Probation is more or less the right way to describe the situation Uchida is faced with, if not more serious,\" the source said this week.\n\n\"In the worst-case scenario he could be shown the door.\"\n\nUchida referred Reuters queries to Nissan about whether he had just months to demonstrate he could turn the carmaker around, whether board members were satisfied with his work, and his relationship with other senior executives.\n\nThe company rejected suggestions of Uchida's uncertain circumstances as having \"no factual basis\". \"Effectively or otherwise, Uchida is absolutely not on probation,\" a Yokohama-based spokesman added. \"There does not exist such a concept or system within Nissan to put a CEO on probation. He is CEO.\"\n\nSome supporters also stressed that Uchida has only been in the top job for little more than two months, while Nissan's business has been in decline since 2017. Executives and analysts have previously said the company's current woes are not of Uchida's making, but are the fallout from an aggressive and poorly executed global expansion under Ghosn and Uchida's predecessor Hiroto Saikawa.\n\n\"Nissan is on the right path for recovery ... although it might be a gradual process,\" Uchida, formerly Nissan's China chief, said in a video message to employees in October, shortly after being named CEO.\n\nStill, it has been a difficult start for the new CEO, who officially took the helm at the beginning of December and must act swiftly to counter a slide in sales that is accelerating in key markets like the United States and China.\n\nWhen he took the stage at corporate headquarters in Yokohama early that month, Uchida billed himself and his senior leaders - No. 2 Ashwani Gupta and No. 3 Jun Seki - as a tight \"one team\" that could deliver a bright new dawn for the automaker.\n\nLater in December, two board members sat down with Uchida - whose elevation has been opposed in some quarters - to tell him he needed to consult more with Seki and Gupta, stressing he had been given the top job on the condition that he worked closely with the pair, according to two of the sources.\n\nThe \"one team\" hasn't shown much unity, though.\n\nSeki resigned in late December and joined electric motor producer Nidec Corp as president.\n\nChief Operating Officer Gupta, meanwhile, has griped privately to colleagues about having a dysfunctional working relationship with the new CEO, according to two of the sources, but he is committed to work with Uchida to turn Nissan around.\n\nOne source said the board would not brook internal squabbles or procrastination among Uchida, Gupta and the rest of the executive team: \"The biggest problem is nothing getting done, at a time when we need to take decisive actions.\"\n\nGupta referred Reuters queries to Nissan, which said Uchida and Gupta were \"cooperating closely, sharing information, and are engaged with executing the performance recovery plan and other reform moves, including fixed cost-cutting\".\n\nNissan, Japan's second-biggest automaker after Toyota (7203.T), faces an array of structural woes, from high fixed costs to weak management to a strained partnership with Renault, which began unraveling after Ghosn's arrest in late 2018.\n\nThe problems come at a pivotal time when Nissan and other automakers are attempting to come to grips with a major, and costly, technological shift toward electric and self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe carmaker posted a net loss of 26.1 billion yen ($238 million) for the October-December third quarter and it cut its annual operating profit forecast by 43% to 85 billion yen.\n\nThough Nissan expects to report a small profit for the year ending in March, some executives are worried it could post a loss, according to the sources, especially given the fact that the forecast does not take into account the impact on sales in China and beyond from the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nUchida said, at the earnings media conference on Thursday, that Nissan was looking at the possibility of accelerating existing restructuring plans, as well as implementing additional measures - but he added the company would not be able to provide details of those extra steps until May.\n\nUchida replaced Saikawa, who resigned in September after admitting to being improperly overpaid. His appointment was contentious, with some members of the board's six-strong nomination committee pushing for Seki or Gupta, according to two of the sources.\n\nSeki, in fact, garnered the most first-choice votes - three - but not a majority, leading to another round where second preferences were taken into account, Uchida received five second-choice votes so won the job, the people said.\n\nBy mid-January, however, some board members were starting to regret the decision, said the sources. While Uchida had touted a fresh start in his speech in December, he has still not publicly spelled out specifics on strategy.\n\nSome members of the board complained that he was even sitting on some of the turnaround measures hammered out by Nissan executives last year, before he took the reins of the company, the sources said.\n\nA team led by Seki, and charged with formulating a series of turnaround measures, had proposed effectively pulling out of Indonesia, where the Nissan group's market share fell below 2% in 2018, according to a separate source close to that team.\n\nUnder the plan, the company would ask partner Mitsubishi (7211.T), an SUV powerhouse in Southeast Asia, to contract-manufacture Nissan cars and help market them in Indonesia, the person said.\n\nWhen Uchida became CEO, however, he struck a cautious stance and made no decisions on that proposed pullout, though the idea has more recently began gaining momentum after much prodding by Uchida's subordinates and the board, according to the source.\n\nIn November, Seki's team also suggested Nissan go into a more intense \"crisis mode\", significantly stepping up spending cuts, including sizable reductions in year-end bonuses for top executives, said the source, adding that the proposals had not been implemented under Uchida.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"},

than 300 Chinese companies are seeking bank loans totaling at least 57.4 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) to help to soften the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, two banking sources said.\n\nAuthorities have cordoned off cities, suspended transport links and shuttered facilities where crowds gather, hammering economic growth that one senior economist said could slow to 5% or less in the first quarter.\n\nExtended factory closures, meanwhile, will slow manufacturing and weigh on global supply chains.\n\nAmong the prospective borrowers are food delivery giant Meituan Dianping (3690.HK), smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), ride-hailing provider Didi Chuxing Technology Co, facial recognition start-up Megvii Technology Inc and internet security business Qihoo 360 Technology Co, the sources said, adding that the companies seeking loans were either involved in the control of the epidemic or had been hardest hit.\n\nChina is fighting to contain the epidemic, which has killed more than 900 people in the country and infected more than 40,000.\n\nThe companies seeking loans in the Chinese capital are likely to get fast-track approvals and preferential interest rates, said the sources, who received copies of two lists of company names sent to Beijing banks by the city government's finance bureau.\n\nThe two lists also contained the size of loans sought.\n\nThere is no official data showing the total loans Chinese companies are seeking nationwide to weather the outbreak.\n\n\"Banks will have the final say on lending decisions,\" one of the sources said. \"The interest rates are likely to be on par with those offered to banks' top clients.\"\n\nXiaomi, the world's fourth-biggest smartphone maker, is seeking 5 billion yuan ($716 million) in loans to produce and sell medical equipment including masks and thermometers, according to the lists.\n\nMeituan Dianping is seeking 4 billion yuan, partly to help finance free food and deliveries to medical staff in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak in central Hubei province.\n\nPrivately held Didi Chuxing, \"severely impacted by the virus outbreak\", is seeking 50 million yuan.\n\nExchange disclosures showed that Xiaomi's third-quarter revenue growth slowed, but gross profit surged 25.2% year on year to 8.2 billion yuan. Meituan Dianping has been profitable for the past two quarters.\n\nBeijing-based Qihoo 360 is seeking 1 billion yuan ($143.3 million) to buy medical-related products and finance work on apps to track and contain the virus.\n\nFacial recognition start-up Megvii applied for 100 million yuan to develop technology including means to improve the accuracy of identifying masked individuals in crowds, according to one of the lists.\n\nMegvii declined to confirm the loan or the loan application.\n\nMegvii said it is working to optimize the artificial intelligence-enabled body temperature screening product it launched last week to help fight the virus, by spotting and locating people in a crowd who have elevated temperatures, even if they are wearing masks. Megvii does not verify the personal identities of people wearing masks.\n\nBeijing-based Megvii has sought to raise funds through an initial public offering in Hong Kong, but its efforts were initially delayed after its inclusion on a U.S. trade blacklist over alleged involvement in human rights violations related to Beijing's clampdown on Uighurs in China's Xinjiang region. The company has said it \"strongly objected\" to the U.S. move.\n\nMeituan Dianping, Didi and Xiaomi declined to comment. Qihoo 360 did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe financial bureau of the Beijing city government did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nThe finance bureau previously said that businesses seeking financial support could ask for its help.\n\nCompanies on the bureau's lists also include vegetable market operators, ambulance manufacturers, environmental protection firms and other businesses key to maintaining food supplies and supporting efforts to contain the outbreak. But it was not immediately clear if all of them are creditworthy.\n\n\"The banks won't lend to all because they need to evaluate whether those companies are really able to pay back,\" one of the sources said.\n\nChina's central bank has injected cash into the banking system to shore up market confidence, while the banking and insurance watchdog has also urged lenders to lower interest rates.\n\nThe local bureaus of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the top economic planner, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) are also compiling lists of affected companies and offering them support.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megvii",

urged the Philippines on Tuesday to lift a travel ban on its citizens after Manila included them in curbs on arrivals from China in a bid to control a coronavirus epidemic, despite Taiwan's small number of cases.\n\nTaiwan is governed entirely separately from China, but Beijing claims the island as its own and the World Health Organization (WHO) clubs its virus cases in the category for China.\n\nTaiwan's Foreign Ministry said it had been in close touch with the Philippines to seek a lifting of Monday's sudden ban, which stranded some Taiwanese at Philippine airports.\n\n\"We are proactively in communication and have lodged representations with the Philippines, including the presidential office and foreign ministry, to tell them that we are not a virus area of China's,\" spokeswoman Joanne Ou said in Taipei.\n\nTaiwan has just 18 virus infections, versus more than 42,000 in China. It has complained the WHO classification has misled countries into believing it poses the same health risk as China, prompting them to impose the same flight and travel curbs on it.\n\nTaiwan and the Philippines have close economic and cultural ties, but no formal diplomatic relations, as the Philippines, like most countries, only recognizes the government in Beijing, and not in Taipei.\n\nMore than 115,000 Philippine citizens live and work in Taiwan, mainly in factories and employed as household help.\n\nAfter Italy banned Taiwan flights this month, Philippine immigration officials late on Monday placed an immediate travel ban on Taiwanese, following the same previously announced curbs that covered China, including Hong Kong and Macau.\n\n\"While not explicitly stated, we have confirmed...that Taiwan is indeed part of the ban, and this expansion shall be implemented immediately,\" Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said in a statement.\n\nPhilippine airlines have now canceled flights to and from Taiwan, with Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Cebu Pacific saying the cancellations aimed to manage the risks from the fast spreading virus outbreak.\n\nTaiwan has also encountered instances of its citizens being either caught up in bans on visitors from China, or of foreign officials confusing them with Chinese, even in the absence of bans.\n\nOu said Taiwan's own virus control efforts and overall situation were both good.\n\nThe foreign ministry has notified its embassies and representative offices to advise host nations around the world that Taiwan is not

past two weeks China's police have been raiding houses, restaurants and makeshift markets across the country, arresting nearly 700 people for breaking the temporary ban on catching, selling or eating wild animals.\n\nThe scale of the crackdown, which has netted almost 40,000 animals including squirrels, weasels and boars, suggests that China's taste for eating wildlife and using animal parts for medicinal purposes is not likely to disappear overnight, despite potential links to the new coronavirus.\n\nTraders legally selling donkey, dog, deer, crocodile and other meat told Reuters they plan to get back to business as soon as the markets reopen.\n\n\"I'd like to sell once the ban is lifted,\" said Gong Jian, who runs a wildlife store online and operates shops in China's autonomous Inner Mongolia region. \"People like buying wildlife. They buy for themselves to eat or give as presents because it is very presentable and gives you face.\"\n\nGong said he was storing crocodile and deer meat in large freezers but would have to kill all the quails he had been breeding as supermarkets were no longer buying his eggs and they cannot be eaten after freezing.\n\nScientists suspect, but have not proven, that the new coronavirus passed to humans from bats via pangolins, a small ant-eating mammal whose scales are highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nSome of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to Wuhan's seafood market, where bats, snakes, civets and other wildlife were sold. China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.\n\nThat may not be enough to change tastes or attitudes that are deeply rooted in the country's culture and history.\n\n\"In many people's eyes, animals are living for man, not sharing the earth with man,\" said Wang Song, a retired researcher of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,600 people in China, revived a debate in the country about the use of wildlife for food and medicine. It previously came to prominence in 2003 during the spread of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which scientists believe was passed to humans from bats, via civets.\n\nMany academics, environmentalists and residents in China have joined international conservation groups in calling for a permanent ban on trade in wildlife and closure of the markets where wild animals are sold.\n\nOnline debate within China, likely swayed by younger people, has heavily favored a permanent ban.\n\n\"One bad habit is that we dare to eat anything,\" said one commenter called Sun on a news discussion forum on Chinese website Sina. \"We must stop eating wildlife and those who do should be sentenced to jail.\"\n\nNevertheless, a minority of Chinese still like to eat wild animals in the belief it is healthy, providing the demand that sustains wildlife markets like that in Wuhan and a thriving online sales business, much of which is illegal.\n\nOne online commenter calling themselves Onlooker Pharaoh said on Chinese news platform Hupu that the risk was worth it: \"Giving up wildlife to eat as food is like giving up eating because you might choke.\"\n\nThe breeding and trading of wild animals in China is supported by the government and is a source of profit for many people.\n\nAfter the SARS outbreak, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) strengthened oversight of the wildlife business, licensing the legal farming and sale of 54 wild animals including civets, turtles and crocodiles, and approved breeding of endangered species including bears, tigers and pangolins for environmental or conservation purposes.\n\nThese officially sanctioned wildlife farming operations produce about $20 billion in annual revenue, according to a 2016 government-backed report.\n\n\"The state forestry bureau has long been the main force supporting wildlife use,\" said Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist for the Humane Society International. \"It insists on China's right to use wildlife resources for development purposes.\"\n\nMuch of the farming and sale of wildlife takes place in rural or poorer regions under the blessing of local authorities who see trading as a boost for the local economy. State-backed television programs regularly show people farming animals, including rats, for commercial sale and their own consumption.\n\nHowever, activists pushing for a ban describe the licensed farms as a cover for illegal wildlife trafficking, where animals are specifically bred to be consumed as food or medicine rather than released into the wild.\n\n\"They just use this premise to do illegal trading,\" Zhou Jinfeng, head of China's Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Reuters. \"There are no real pangolin farms in China, they just use the permits to do illegal things.\"\n\nThe NFGA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAnimal products, from bear bile to pangolin scales, are still used in some traditional Chinese medicine, an industry China wants to expand as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nBut the distinction between legal and illegal is blurred. The United Nations estimates the global illegal wildlife trade is worth about $23 billion a year. China is by far the largest market, environmental groups say.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an independent organization based in London which campaigns against what it sees as environmental abuses, said in a report this week the coronavirus outbreak has in fact boosted some illegal wildlife trafficking as traders in China and Laos are selling rhinoceros horn medicines as a treatment to reduce fever.\n\nChina's top legislature will toughen laws on wildlife trafficking this year, the official Xinhua news agency reported this week.\n\n\"We are in a sun-setting business,\" said Xiang Chengchuan, a wholesale wildlife store owner in the landlocked eastern Anhui province. \"Few people eat dogs now, but it was popular 20 years ago.\"\n\nXiang, who sells gift boxes of deer antlers and dog, donkey and peacock meat to wealthy bank clients and others, said he had frozen his meat as he waits to see if the ban will continue.\n\n\"I will resume selling once the policy allows us, but now I have no idea how long it (the ban) will last.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Natural disasters, strikes, and terrorist attacks can all be force majeure events.\n\nDeclaring force majeure may allow a party to a contract to avoid liability for nonperformance.\n\nLegal experts said that the coronavirus likely qualifies, but any company invoking force majeure would need to show that it is effectively impossible to perform their contractual duties as a result of the outbreak.\n\nIn other words, a company is not excused from an obligation just because it has become more costly or time-consuming, said John Scannapieco, a Nashville, Tennessee-based lawyer who advises U.S. companies on Chinese transactions.\n\nThe coronavirus is \"not carte blanche to say force majeure,\" said Scannapieco, a shareholder at law firm Baker Donelson. \"You have look at the facts and circumstances.\"\n\nCross-border deals typically include clauses that allow for non-performance during force majeure events, said Vanessa Miller, a U.S. lawyer at Foley & Lardner. These clauses are sometimes \"cut and paste\" and \"not reviewed as carefully as they ought to be,\" Miller said.\n\nForce majeure clauses rarely mention diseases, but more frequently provide relief in the event of unforeseen \"acts of government,\" Miller said. Chinese authorities have ordered lockdowns and closed factories in the wake of the coronavirus, so the \"act of government\" language could allow some firms to invoke force majeure, she said.\n\nWHO DECIDES WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IF FORCE MAJEURE IS DECLARED?\n\nCross-border deals often stipulate that disputes arising out of the contract will be decided by a particular court or arbitration body.\n\nIn practice, foreign firms doing business in China may be better off avoiding litigation and negotiating a compromise, Scannapieco said.\n\nChina's biggest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), has invoked force majeure to suspend contracts with at least three suppliers, two sources told Reuters on Feb. 6, without specifying whether the coronavirus is what triggered the action.\n\nFrench oil major Total (TOTF.PA) said a day later it had rejected a force majeure notice from an unnamed Chinese LNG buyer, the first global energy supplier to push back publicly against such an effort.\n\nAlso last week, two sources said a copper smelter in southwest China had also declared force majeure on deliveries of copper concentrate.\n\nOn Jan. 31, a Chinese international trade promotion agency said it would offer force majeure certificates to companies struggling to cope with the impact of the coronavirus on their business with overseas partners. It didn't identify any companies affected, and didn't disclose whether it had received any requests.\n\nLegal experts said although these certificates carry significant weight, they do not rule out further negotiation or even litigation.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Force majeure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquefied natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southwest China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smelting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special Operations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 9}], "image": null, "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 994}, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 994, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1450227446", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-16", "time": "23:09:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-16T23:09:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-16T22:59:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-hubei-idUSKBN20A0QQ", "title": "China's Hubei reports 1,933 new cases of coronavirus on Feb. 16:...", "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, reported 1,933 new cases and 100 new deaths on Feb. 16, the local health authority said on Monday.\n\nThe number of new cases rose nearly 5% from the previous day, but the number of deaths fell from 139 on Saturday.

Here is what we know - and do not know - about the virus:\n\nThe coronavirus family of viruses includes the common cold and more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\n\nMany of those with the new virus who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.\n\nCoronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough and breathing difficulties.\n\nSome 15% of cases are severe and 3% critical, according to Chinese data shared with the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nStatistics from China indicate that about 2% of people infected with the new virus have died, suggesting it may be deadlier than seasonal flu but less deadly than SARS, which killed about 10% of infected individuals. The MERS outbreak in 2012 had a fatality rate of about 35%.\n\nPeople over 80 years old have the highest death rates from the new coronavirus, WHO says.\n\nThe virus can be transmitted via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes, and can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles.\n\nExperts have said it is more easily transmitted than the SARS virus. The incubation period is believed to be up to 14 days. People may be able to infect others before symptoms appear.\n\nThe WHO recommends that people frequently wash hands, cover their mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.\n\n\"We recommend the use of masks for people who have symptoms ... because the virus transmits through droplets,\" says medical expert Sylvie Briand.\n\nBut they do not guarantee protection against infection.\n\n\"For people who don't have symptoms, the mask in fact is not useful,\" Briand says.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says face masks are not required for the general public.\n\nThere is no vaccine or known effective treatments, according to the WHO.\n\nChinese scientists were able to identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and shared it publicly. Scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, a step toward creating a vaccine.\n\nDrugmakers around the globe expect to begin testing experimental vaccines on humans in about three months. Work on increasing diagnostic capabilities globally has also ramped up.\n\nAbout 99% of the more than 40,000 cases have been reported in mainland China. There have been over 300 cases in 24 other countries, according to the WHO.\n\nOver 900 people have died in China, most in and around the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines, both following visits to Wuhan.\n\nSingapore, Thailand and Japan have the most cases outside of China\n\nIt took the new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first1,000 people. It took SARS 130 days to infect 1,000 people. It took MERS 2.5 years to infect 1,000 people.\n\nThe Chinese government has virtually locked down the central province of Hubei, home to 60 million people, and its capital Wuhan.\n\nChina is facing mounting isolation as airlines suspend flights to its cities.\n\nThe United States and Australia have banned entry to foreign nationals who have recently traveled to China.\n\nMany countries have evacuated their citizens from Hubei and are putting them in quarantine or isolation upon return.\n\nThe WHO has not recommended travel or trade curbs with China.\n\nIt is believed to have originated in a food market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species.\n\nThat intermediate species may have been pangolins - the world's only scaly mammals, China's official Xinhua news agency reported, based on DNA similarities. Other scientists have yet to confirm that finding.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As of Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) expected every nation in Africa to be able to diagnose the disease.\n\nThe rush reflects a global push for diagnostic capabilities, particularly in developing countries, in hopes of averting a global pandemic. But it is being slowed by a desperate need for virus samples necessary to validate the tests.\n\n\"Without vital diagnostic capacity, countries are in the dark as to how far and wide the virus has spread and who has coronavirus or another disease with similar symptoms,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva on Monday.\n\nAs of early Monday, there had been 40,235 confirmed cases reported in China and 909 deaths, as well as 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death.\n\nMost of the testing is being done by public health laboratories. But several companies including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, GenScript Biotech Corp and Co-Diagnostics Inc have developed tests and are taking steps to get them validated for clinical use.\n\nRoche is distributing coronavirus tests developed by Tib Molbiol of Berlin for research use on some of its instruments while developing a test of its own. Abbott Laboratories also is working on a test.\n\nWHO has activated a network of 15 referral laboratories that can support national efforts in confirming new cases, and has identified 168 labs globally with the technology to diagnose the virus.\n\nTechnicians must be trained to run the tests locally to avoid delays associated with having to send them to centralized labs.\n\nOn Tuesday, WHO is convening a two-day meeting of hundreds of researchers and manufacturers to address the outbreak.\n\nResearchers are also working to develop antibody tests that can tell whether someone has been exposed to the virus. They could help answer how broadly this virus has spread, and whether there are milder cases not being detected, Dr. Mike Ryan, head of the WHO emergency program, told reporters.\n\nChina appears to have adequate stock of the materials needed to perform diagnostic tests, but there is a limited number of trained technicians who can run them. \"The workload on those labs is extreme,\" Ryan said.\n\nOutside of China, manufacturers are quickly developing tests based on the genetic code of the virus. Those tests still need to be validated with actual virus samples, for which access has been challenging.\n\nLive isolation of the virus allows a huge advance in diagnostics and potential advances in therapeutics and vaccine development, Ryan said.\n\nGenScript, which has offices in New Jersey and Nanjing, China, has developed a test available to researchers. It cannot be used as a diagnostic until it has been tested in hundreds of virus samples.\n\n\"In China, we couldn't get to the samples directly because we don't have a lab that can handle the virus,\" said Hong Li, a GenScript scientist.\n\nThe company has sent its test kits to Chinese health officials to assess their validity. \"Because other companies in China are also doing that, we don't know when it will be our turn,\" said Eric Wang, GenScript's head of marketing.\n\nUtah-based Co-Diagnostics on Monday said it has started shipping its test, which is available for research purposes, to clients. Chief Scientific Officer Brent Satterfield said last week that the company has been struggling to find clinical virus samples to validate the test for use as a diagnostic.\n\nThermo Fisher developed its tests based on the genetic code of the virus, and ran computer models to validate it.\n\nThe company has been providing its test to countries and health ministries with access to virus samples, said Thermo Fisher executive Joshua Trotta. \"They will evaluate our kits and make a determination of what is the best test to deploy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Thermo Fisher is scaling up production as countries prepare for more cases. Demand is \"growing every day,\" Trotta said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tedros Adhanom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Laboratories", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abbott Laboratories"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermo_Fisher_Scientific", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermo Fisher Scientific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffmann-La_Roche", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hoffmann-La Roche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nanjing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nanjing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 68}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 32}], "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200210&t=2&i=1488496222&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG191LY", "eventUri": "eng-5506677", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 99}, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 99, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1442729930", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-02-10", "time": "20:38:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-10T20:38:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-10T20:38:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-harker-idUSKBN2042BX", "title": "Fed's Harker says central bank should hold rates steady for a while", "body": "(Reuters) - The U.S. economy is in good shape and the Federal Reserve should hold rates steady for the time being, a top Fed official said on Monday.\n\nPhiladelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said he expects economic growth to reach 2% this year and that the unemployment rate could stay below 4% for a couple of years, according to remarks prepared for a speech in Newark, Delaware.\n\n\"My own view right now is that we should hold steady for a while and watch how developments and the data unfold before taking any more action,\" Harker said. The policymaker said he thinks the U.S. economy is on track to reach the central bank's 2% inflation target.\n\nFed officials left rates unchanged at last month's policy meeting, with the target range for the central bank's benchmark rate at 1.50% to 1.75%. Policymakers said rates are well positioned following three rate reductions last year and signaled rates are likely to stay on hold unless there is a substantial change to the economic outlook.\n\nHarker, who became a voting member for policy decisions last year, did not support the last two rate reductions. He said before last month's meeting that there could be downsides to lower rates, which could encourage investors to take more risk.\n\nOn Monday, Harker said lower mortgage rates could lead more homeowners to refinance their loans, a shift that could boost consumer spending. The policymaker said mortgage refinancing could provide homeowners with more spending cash in two ways. First, it could lower their monthly payments. Second, some homeowners may tap their equity when they refinance, which would provide more spending money.\n\nStill, there are several risks that could drag down the economy, Harker said. Businesses are hesitating to invest on hiring and equipment because of uncertainty over trade, the global economy and geopolitical tensions, he said.\n\nConcerns over the coronavirus outbreak could also affect economic growth, he said. \"It's too early to say what impact the spread of the coronavirus will have on the global economy, but the negative effects on the Chinese economy and international travel are something to watch,\" Harker said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_T._Harker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick T.

Worries about the spread of the coronavirus and its hit to the global economy kept Japanese manufacturers' mood gloomy in February, a Reuters poll found, even as firms shook off previous worries about the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war.\n\nThe monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's key tankan quarterly survey, found business confidence across the sectors staying flat over the next three months, as the coronavirus added to uncertainty over the global outlook and the October national sales tax hike.\n\nThe flu-like virus has killed more than 1,100 people in China, and it has already taken a toll on China's economy -- Japan's largest trading partner -- hampering supply chains for car manufacturers to smartphone makers and causing the number of Chinese shoppers to plunge in Japan.\n\nIt has also highlighted the vulnerability of the Japanese economy to external shocks just as worries have somewhat eased over the Sino-U.S. trade war and Britain's exit from the European Union.\n\nOn top of external woes, a sales tax hike in October dealt a blow to the consumer sector, which makes up the bulk of Japan's economic activity, dashing hopes that solid domestic demand would offset weak exports.\n\n\"Just as the domestic economy's slump following the sales tax hike is becoming evident, the coronavirus spread has made China-bound exports totally unclear,\" a manager of a chemicals firm wrote in the Reuters poll of 502 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 245 firms replied on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers stood at minus 5 in February, up a tad from minus 6 in the previous month. However, materials industries such as chemicals, steel, paper and pulp put a drag on the overall sentiment index.\n\nThe index has remained in negative territory -- meaning pessimism outweighs optimism -- for seven straight months.\n\nThe service-sector index inched up to plus 15 from plus 14 in January, but sentiment among retailers, information and communications weighed on overall business confidence, according to the survey conducted Jan. 30-Feb. 12.\n\nBoth manufacturers' and non-manufacturers' indexes are expected to stay unchanged in May.\n\nThe BOJ's December tankan showed big manufacturers' mood hit a near seven-year low in the fourth quarter as the trade war between the world's two largest economies lingered.\n\nThe world's third-largest economy grew an annualized 1.8% in July-September, but economists see a fourth-quarter contraction, as the tax hike hit consumers and U.S.-China trade friction knocked exports.

But a purpose-built aero exhibition center is pockmarked with empty spaces reserved for Chinese companies and others skipping the show because of the outbreak, whose death toll exceeds 900.\n\nMajor suppliers Honeywell (HON.N) and Leonardo (LDOF.MI) joined a list of 70 no-shows on Monday amid concerns related to the new coronavirus, which first erupted in China.\n\nAlthough riddled with hype and pre-packaged announcements, air shows are widely seen as a litmus test of confidence in the aerospace industry and bring together tens of thousands of people to network around cabin mock-ups and arms stalls.\n\nBut few deals are expected at the Feb 11-16 Singapore event, where the epidemic has triggered new safety measures and cast a shadow over airline profits and demand for airplanes.\n\nFresh evidence of the impact emerged on the eve of the show as UK-based consultancy Ascend by Cirium said the number of flights scheduled to operate to, from and within China had dropped by 24% compared with expectations before the crisis.\n\nWorse, the number of flights actually operated was down by half compared with normal seasonal levels as many airlines continued to slash flights below their newly adjusted schedules.\n\nThat means Asian airlines are bracing for a turbulent 2020. Cancellations bring costs in lost revenue and ticket rebates.\n\n\"All bets are off in terms of traffic forecasts for this year,\" Andrew Herdman, the director general of the Association for Asia Pacific Airlines, said in an interview.\n\nBefore the crisis, the International Air Transport Association, which represents global airlines, saw passenger traffic rising by 4% in 2020 and cargo traffic 2% higher.\n\n\"If you look at the schedule cuts and the actual operations they have been cut by 50%, 60%, 70% within China. It is pretty drastic,\" Herdman said.\n\nA key question on delegates' minds is whether the virus will tip the aviation industry into a long-anticipated downturn. So far growth has been resilient to shocks such as the 2003 SARS virus.\n\n\"One of the lessons from SARS was that traffic was affected but also that it rebounded in 6-8 months,\" Randy Tinseth, vice-president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said.\n\nBrazil's Embraer is preparing to ride the crisis out.\n\n\"I am hopeful that we will see the coronavirus peak in the next 2-3 weeks and then taper off, but until we do on the passenger travel side the impact is profound and immediate,\" commercial aviation head John Slattery said.\n\nEmbraer is attending the show as part of a marketing blitz for its E195-E2 against the Airbus A220. Slattery lamented delays in European Union approval for a tie-up between Embraer and Boeing that echoes Airbus's purchase of the Canadian A220.\n\nThe air show's organizers said on Sunday they still expected more than 930 companies from 45 countries and 45,000 trade attendees - down from the 54,000 at the last show in 2018.\n\nThe lobbies of major hotels, usually bustling with attendees, were noticeably quiet, however. Privately, some delegates have expressed surprise the show is going ahead after the government advised against large-scale non-essential events.\n\nOrganizers say they have a duty to those still wishing to attend a show that has grown in importance over the years.\n\nReflecting the financial and strategic stakes involved in aerospace, such biennial events are not cheap to organize.\n\nOne exhibitor who has planned air shows worldwide said supporting an aircraft flight display would typically cost $1 million or more and big manufacturers could spend $2 million to $5 million in total on a show of this size, including travel.\n\nCancelling the show would lead to refunds running into tens of millions of dollars, a source at one exhibitor said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nOrganiser Experia Events, partly owned by ST Engineering (STEG.SI) and government agencies, charges at least S$1,550 per square meter for space in the show, according to its website.\n\nExperia on Sunday declined to comment on cancellation terms.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

of soy and iron ore fell in the first week of February compared to a year ago, government data showed on Monday, as traders watched for signs the coronavirus outbreak in China could affect demand for Brazilian commodities.\n\nFor the first five working days of February, soybean exports declined to 198,600 tonnes per day on average from 263,500 tonnes per day for February 2019, according to Economy Ministry figures. Iron ore exports averaged 1.27 million tonnes per day for the first week of February, down from 1.4 million tonnes per day a year ago.\n\nBy contrast, Brazil's average daily exports of meat and oil rose in the first five working days of February.\n\nBrazilian government data does not break down exports by product for individual countries, although China is the largest buyer of Brazilian soy, iron ore, meat and oil.\n\n\"It's still very early,\" said Jose Augusto de Castro, the president of Foreign Trade Association of Brazil. \"I think the impact will start from the second half of February.\"\n\nCastro said he expects to see a drop in commodity prices as a result of coronavirus and possibly volumes as well, but it is difficult to predict the scale and duration of the impact.\n\nThe outbreak has roiled the Chinese economy and society. The World Health Organization said on Monday that cases recorded outside of China could be \"the spark that becomes a bigger fire.\"\n\nThe outbreak is affecting several major commodities. Iron ore stocks are rising as demand falls in China. Oil prices have fallen to their lowest level in 13 months. Shipping routes are reducing calls on Chinese ports and air freight is being squeezed.\n\nA report by Rabobank on Monday predicted that, as Chinese workers at soy crushing plants return to work after an extended Chinese New Year holiday, they would continue to import soybeans \"but at a slower pace, as long as coronavirus lingers.\"\n\nCoronavirus is only likely to affect demand for grains and edible oil modestly and in the short term, as Chinese eat out less but continue to buy food staples, Rabobank said.\n\nBartolomeu Braz, president of Brazilian farmer association Aprosoja, said in a message on social media that more than 60% of Brazilian soy from the current crop is pre-sold, helping to cushion farmers from the impact of the coronavirus.\n\n\"This gives us breathing space until the disease is controlled,\" Braz said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soybean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fidel Castro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Staple food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooking oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Import and Export", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200210&t=2&i=1488517864&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG191P5", "eventUri": null, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 6}, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 6, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1442930095", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-11", "time": "00:56:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-11T00:56:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-11T00:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8392156958580017, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-forex-idUSKBN20502C", "title": "Dollar recedes from four-month highs as risk appetite improves", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar retreated from a four-month high against the euro on Tuesday as risk appetite improved after a weeklong rally helped by a safe-haven bid fueled by fears over China's coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes scaled new highs as investors took heart from remarks by a top Chinese health adviser that the outbreak may be peaking. [.N]\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak in China may be over by April, the country's senior medical adviser said, even as deaths surpassed 1,000 and the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of a global threat potentially worse than terrorism.\n\n\"There's been a bit of a disjoint with the way the equity market has been trading in the last couple of sessions and the way the FX markets have been moving, and I think to some degree we're seeing a bit of catchup on the FX side of things,\" said Bipan Rai, North American head of FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto.\n\nConcerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus have added a safety bid for the greenback in recent sessions, while economic data has boosted the view that the U.S. economic outlook is stronger than the euro zone's.\n\nThe dollar has also gained as low volatility across most of the foreign exchange market has encouraged investors to seek out carry trades, where they borrow in low-yielding currencies such as the euro and the franc and invest in dollars or other high-yielding currencies.\n\n\"One of the big prevailing narratives right now is for the carry trade,\" said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. \"As volatility seems to be nonexistent in the FX market, a lot of people are piling into this short euro, long higher beta, higher interest rate currencies.\"\n\nThe euro fell as low as $1.0892 on Tuesday, the lowest since Oct. 1, before bouncing back to $1.0923.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress on Tuesday the U.S. economy is in a good place, even as he cited the potential threat from the coronavirus and concerns about the economy's long-term health.\n\nData on Tuesday showed U.S. job openings dropped for a second straight month in December to hit their lowest level in two years, while hiring increased marginally, suggesting a recent acceleration in job growth was unlikely to be sustained.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType":
