Other Asian markets that were open rallied.\n\n\"History shows us as we look back at several different examples that these viral outbreaks tend to be short lived,\" said Candice Bangsund, a global asset allocation portfolio manager at Fiera Capital in Montreal.\n\nWhile markets should gyrate for awhile, the global economy will resume the improving growth it started to exhibit late last year, Bangsund said.\n\n\"The economy could be ripe for a sharp snapback or a V-shaped recovery once we find out when this is contained and when the outbreak is indeed brought under control,\" she said. \"We maintain the global economy will come back to life.\"\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.65%, while its emerging market index lost 0.05%.\n\nShares on Wall Street also surged. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 187.05 points, or 0.66%, to 28,722.85. The S&P 500 gained 32.61 points, or 1.01%, to 3,276.24 and the Nasdaq Composite added 130.37 points, or 1.43%, to 9,269.68.\n\nOil futures edged up after falling for five days, following the recovery in equities and talk that Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies might tighten the market amid fears the coronavirus could weigh on oil demand.\n\nBrent futures settled up 19 cents at $59.51 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled up 34 cents at $53.48. [O/R]\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note bounced off three-month lows after a key part of the yield curve briefly inverted for the first time since October.\n\nThe yield fell as low as 1.57% overnight, the lowest since Oct. 10, before the 10-year note pared some losses to fall 13/32 in price and lift its yield to 1.6493%.\n\nAn inverted curve, when longer-dated yields fall below shorter-maturity ones, has often been a precursor of a U.S. recession.\n\nEuro zone government bond yields bounced off three-month lows to rise for the first time in over a week after U.S. consumer confidence exceeded expectations to hit its highest level since August.\n\nTraders awaited the outcome of a two-day meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers, which started on Tuesday. The market consensus is that the central bank will keep interest rates unchanged at between 1.5% and 1.75%.\n\nThe dollar index rose 0.02%, with the euro up 0.03% to $1.1019.

States ramped up its response to the coronavirus epidemic on Friday, declaring a public health emergency and saying it would halt entry to foreign nationals who had been to China within the 14-day incubation period.\n\nThat measure followed on from an earlier travel advisory that warned Americans not to travel to China and angered Beijing.\n\nOriginating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like virus first identified earlier in January has resulted in 213 deaths in China, according to local health authorities. Wuhan and the surrounding region of Hubei are in virtual quarantine.\n\nMore than 9,800 people have been infected in China and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.\n\nThe World Health Organization said on Thursday that the epidemic constituted a public health emergency of international concern, a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination.\n\n\"Following the World Health Organization's decision... I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States,\" U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said at a public briefing on Friday afternoon.\n\nAs of Sunday, U.S. citizens who had been in Hubei would be subject to compulsory quarantine, he said. Foreign nationals - aside from the immediate family of citizens and residents - who had traveled in China in the last 14 days would be denied entry, said Azar.\n\n\"The risk is low in the United States... but our job is to keep that risk low as much as we can,\" he said.\n\nThe move will likely anger Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with Washington. Earlier on Friday, it criticized the U.S. travel warning.\n\n\"The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \"It's truly mean.\"\n\nOther countries have also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China or restricted flights. After reporting its first two cases of the illness, Russia on Friday restricted direct flights to China, its biggest trade partner.\n\nSingapore, a major travel hub in Asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders.\n\nMany airlines have chosen to cancel or reduce flights, with airline crews pressuring carriers to act.\n\nGovernments around the world are evacuating citizens from Hubei. A plane with 83 British and 27 foreign nationals landed in Britain on Friday, while Japan, with 14 confirmed cases, has sent three flights to bring citizens home.\n\nThe United States said it would channel all flights from China through seven airports. It has put 195 Americans evacuated to California this week in quarantine.\n\nThe virus has an incubation of between one and 14 days, and there are some limited signs it may also be able to spread before any symptoms show.\n\nFor a full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, click: here\n\nWith major fallout inevitable for China's economy, which is the world's second largest, global shares posted their biggest weekly and monthly losses since August on Friday. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\nThe outbreak could \"reverberate globally,\" Moody's said.\n\nIn the latest impact to big name corporations, South Korea's Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) said it planned to halt production of a sport utility vehicle this weekend due to a supply disruption caused by the outbreak.\n\nHome appliance maker Electrolux (ELUXb.ST) issued a similar warning, French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) said its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until mid-February, and tractor maker Deere & Co (DE.N) said it was temporarily shutting its facilities in China.\n\nWHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the WHO did not support travel or trade curbs. Tedros reiterated in a series of tweets on Friday that his organization had confidence in China's capacity to control the 2019-nCoV virus.\n\n\"Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing and medical supply chains and harming economies. We urge countries and companies to make evidence-based, consistent decisions.\"\n\nGraphic: Tracking the novel coronavirus - here\n\nThe roughly 60 million residents of Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital, have had movements curbed to try and slow the spread of the disease. But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river, a Reuters witness said, and infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan.\n\nChina's statistics show just over 2% of infected people have died, suggesting the virus is less deadly than the 2002-2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n\nBut economists say its financial impact could be bigger than SARS, which killed about 800 people at an estimated cost of $33 billion to the global economy, since China's share of the world economy is now far greater.\n\nLike other respiratory infections, the coronavirus spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes. No deaths have been reported outside China, but it is still too early to know what its death rate will be.\n\n\"The issue now with this is that there's a lot of unknowns,\" said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Robert Redfield.\n\nThe WHO has reported at least eight cases of human-to-human transmission - as opposed to people coming infected from China - in four countries: the United States, Germany, Japan and Vietnam. Thailand said it too had such a case.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus",

Experts say cases of person-to-person transmission - which have also been detected outside China in Germany, Vietnam, and Japan - are especially concerning because they suggest greater potential for the virus to spread further.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, told a news conference in Geneva that recent weeks have witnessed an unprecedented outbreak which has been met by an unprecedented response.\n\n\"Let me be clear, this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China,\" he said. \"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.\"\n\nThe declaration of a global emergency triggers recommendations to all countries. It is aimed at preventing or reducing cross-border spread of disease.\n\nTedros said the WHO was not recommending limiting trade or travel to China due to the outbreak, however.\n\nThe vast majority of the more than 7,800 cases detected globally, according to the latest WHO data, have been in China, where the virus originated in an illegal wildlife market in the city of Wuhan.\n\nBut nearly 100 cases have emerged in other countries, spurring cuts to travel, outbreaks of anti-China sentiment in some places and a surge in demand for protective face masks.\n\nOfficials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the flu-like virus was confirmed in a man in Illinois, bringing the total number of U.S. cases to six. The man's wife, who was also infected, had previously travelled to China, but he had not.\n\nGRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus here\n\nThe WHO held off twice last week from declaring a global emergency. Thursday's move will trigger tighter containment and information-sharing guidelines, but may disappoint Beijing, which had expressed confidence it can beat the \"devil\" virus.\n\nJeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said the WHO decision was \"absolutely right\".\n\n\"Declaration of an international emergency will undoubtedly sharpen governments' focus on protecting citizens,\" Farrar said. The needed public health measures would be a \"challenge\" for all countries, but would be especially difficult for lower-income countries, he added.\n\nThe virus has spread quickly since the WHO's Emergency Committee last met a week ago. But there has been no death reported outside China and neither has the virus emerged in Africa.\n\n\"The vast majority of cases outside China have a history of travel to Wuhan or history of contact with someone with a travel history to Wuhan,\" said Teros.\n\nGRAPHIC: Online package of China virus news here\n\nThe total number of infections has already surpassed the total in the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic.\n\nSARS also came from China, killing about 800 people and costing the global economy an estimated $33 billion.\n\nEconomists fear the impact could be bigger this time as China now accounts for a larger share of the world economy. Markets have been spooked since news of the virus emerged earlier this month. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\nCompanies have also been rattled and Alphabet Inc's Google and Sweden's IKEA were the latest big names to close China operations. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd extended its Lunar New Year holiday closure for some Chinese production facilities.\n\nAirlines to suspend flights to mainland China include Air France, Lufthansa, Air Canada, American Airlines and British Airways.\n\nThousands of factory workers currently on Lunar New Year holidays may struggle to get back to work next week due to travel restrictions.\n\nChina dominated U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's news conference on Wednesday. \"When China's economy slows down we do feel that,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

concerns, gold gains", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets headed toward their first monthly loss since August on Friday as growing concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China sapped risk appetite and lifted the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc.\n\nGold headed to its best month in five, while yields on U.S. and euro zone government debt fell to three-month lows as the United States, Japan and other countries tightened travel curbs to China, where the death toll from the virus rose to 213.\n\nCrude prices fell, with Brent poised for its biggest monthly decline since November 2018, as supply chains disruptions and travel curbs look to crimp Chinese growth, leading economists to temper their outlook for the world's second-largest economy.\n\nCitigroup revised its full-year forecast for China's GDP growth to 5.5% in 2020 from 5.8%. The bank also cut first-quarter growth expectations to 4.8% from 6% in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nJPMorgan shaved its forecast for global growth by 0.3 percentage point for this quarter.\n\nEquity markets tumbled more than 1% as disappointing U.S. and European data pointed to economic weakness and a mixed batch of corporate earnings added to the gloom.\n\nU.S. consumer spending rose steadily in December, the Commerce Department said, but tepid income gains pointed to moderate consumption growth this year.\n\nThe Chicago Purchasing Management index fell to a lower-than-expected 42.9, the lowest since December 2015, as new orders and production tumbled and producers forecast tepid activity in 2020.\n\n\"The Chicago PMI was very weak,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.\n\nThe recently signed U.S.-China trade deal had been expected to lift the global economy, but the coronavirus outbreak has dampened that outlook, he said.\n\n\"Market expectations are for a big push in growth. It's being put off every quarter, especially the industrial side of the economy,\" Ghriskey said. \"Bond yields have plummeted. The bond market is trying to tell us something.\"\n\nYields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note slid to a low of 1.508%.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.21%, while emerging market stocks lost 1.17%.\n\nIn Europe, the pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 1.07%. Losses for the week were 3%, its worst in almost six months, while the 1.2% monthly loss was the worst January since 2016.\n\nEarly gains in Europe quickly soured as headlines of more cases and deaths, travel bans and factory shutdowns due to the virus were compounded by disappointingly weak economic data.\n\nThe big blow was that both the French and Italian economies unexpectedly shrank at the end of last year, with Eurostat also confirming that the euro zone as a whole grew slower than analysts had forecast.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 590.48 points, or 2.05%, to 28,268.96. The S&P 500 lost 56.66 points, or 1.73%, to 3,227 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 137.24 points, or 1.48%, to 9,161.70.\n\nThe poor data reading and fears of a spreading virus obscured relatively solid fourth-quarter earnings reports.\n\nAmazon.com Inc surged 7.7% after it trumped Wall Street's estimates for holiday-quarter results, bolstering the online retailer's market capitalization to more that $1 trillion.\n\nAsia-Pacific shares outside Japan extended their fall, dropping 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei bounced 1%, but was off 2.6% for the week. Hong Kong's Hang Seng drifted 0.3% lower and has shed 9% in two weeks. Korea's Kospi had its worst week in 15 months, losing 5.6%.\n\nSterling extended gains after jumping on Thursday when the Bank of England confounded market expectations by not cutting interest rate cut.\n\nSterling traded at $1.3199, up 0.80% on the day. The yen strengthened 0.52% versus the greenback at 108.41 per dollar.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.47%, with the euro up 0.53% to $1.1088.\n\nThe Australian dollar fell to a four-month low against the U.S. dollar, while China's offshore yuan struggled to find a footing in the wake of the virus outbreak.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note rose 12/32 in price to yield 1.5136%.\n\nSpot gold rose 0.87% at $1,587.5 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures settled 0.1% lower at $1,587.90.\n\nOil prices fell, on track for a fourth straight weekly loss.\n\nBrent crude slid 13 cents to settle at $58.16 a barrel.

virus...", "body": "BEIJING/GENEVA (Reuters) - Foreign governments flew their citizens out of the epicentre of China's coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday, as the number of deaths jumped to 133 and the World Health Organization voiced \"grave concern\" about person-to-person spread in three other countries.\n\nThe WHO said its Emergency Committee would reconvene behind closed doors on Thursday to decide whether the rapid spread of the new virus from China now constitutes a global emergency.\n\n\"In the last few days the progress of the virus especially in some countries, especially human-to-human transmission, worries us,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva, naming Germany, Vietnam and Japan.\n\n\"Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak.\"\n\nThere have been 6,065 cases of the flu-like virus in 15 countries worldwide - all but around 70 in China - according to the latest WHO figures. All the deaths so far have been in China, where the National Health Commission said there had been 132 fatalities as of end-Tuesday. Another death was reported in Sichuan province on Wednesday.\n\nThe situation remained \"grim and complex\", said Chinese President Xi Jinping, who on Tuesday had vowed to defeat the \"devil\" virus. U.S. President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Xi and his administration was working closely with China on containing the outbreak.\n\nSome major airlines suspended flights to China, and a senior economist predicted a major impact on growth.\n\nThe WHO's panel of 16 independent experts twice last week declined to declare an international emergency, but will re-evaluate the situation on Thursday.\n\n\"We are at an important juncture in this event. We believe these chains of transmission can still be interrupted,\" said Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme.\n\nRyan also praised China's response, saying: \"They are taking extraordinary measures in the face of what is an extraordinary challenge.\"\n\nIn many Chinese cities, streets were largely deserted. Tourist attractions were closed, while Starbucks coffee shops required people to have their temperatures taken and to wear masks.\n\n\"It's my first time here in Asia, I feel very unlucky,\" said Brazilian tourist Amanda Lee, 23, cutting short a trip. \"I couldn't even see the places I wanted, like the Great Wall.\"\n\nAlmost all the deaths so far have been in the central province of Hubei, home to about 60 million people and now under virtual lockdown. The virus emerged last month in a live wild animal market in the provincial capital Wuhan.\n\n\"I was extremely worried that I was stuck there,\" said Takeo Aoyama, who arrived in Tokyo on a chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese out of Wuhan as some governments began evacuating their citizens.\n\nThe United States flew about 210 Americans out of Wuhan, to be screened several times on arrival in California. France said a first flight of French nationals would leave on Wednesday night and Britain said it would put 200 citizens on a charter plane on Thursday. Canada was also organising evacuations.\n\nThe virus is weighing heavily on the world's second-biggest economy, with companies cutting corporate travel to China and tourists cancelling trips. Various airlines are cutting flights, from British Airways and Lufthansa to Tanzania's national carrier that postponed maiden flights.\n\nA government economist said the crisis could cut China's first quarter growth by one point to 5% or lower as the crisis hits sectors from mining to luxury goods.\n\nHong Kong stocks took a beating on the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year break. Casino and financial stocks led the Hang Seng index 2.5% lower to a seven-month trough.\n\n\"In our view, the worst is yet to come,\" securities firm Nomura said, warning of a severe, near-term blow to China's economy.\n\nBut in a potentially major step towards finding a vaccine, scientists in Australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the virus, the first recreated outside China.\n\nThe researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity said they would share the sample, grown from an infected patient, with the WHO and global laboratories in the hope of hastening immunisation and detection.\n\nThe number of cases of the new virus in China now exceeds the 5,327 that were infected with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China and killed about 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.\n\nWhile some experts believe the new strain, known as \"2019-nCoV\", is not as deadly as SARS, alarm has grown over its

"(Reuters) - The iPhone is back. But Apple is girding for more disruptions in virus-hit China.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, thanks to rising iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones.\n\nThe performance outweighed concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in China, a major market and manufacturing hub for Apple, and a slight revenue miss in the company's services business, which includes the new Apple TV+ streaming offering.\n\nShares of Apple rose 2% in after-hours trade.\n\nApple forecasted revenue for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations.\n\nChief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company used a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus.\n\n\"We have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week,\" he said. \"The situation is emerging, and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely.\"\n\nApple has suppliers in the Wuhan area, the heart of the outbreak, but has alternatives, Cook said. Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 10, Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.\n\nApple has shut one store in China, he said, and reduced hours at others because of lower foot traffic, Cook said. Third-party stores that sell Apple products are also facing some closures, Cook said.\n\nApple is \"forecasting a stronger Q2 than analysts predicted, but the fact that the coronavirus is spreading in unpredictable ways in China, where Apple has most of its hardware built, could upset this optimistic forecast,\" said eMarketer principal analyst Yoram Wurmser.\n\nThe number of active iPhones, computers and other devices owned by customers, called Apple's installed base, grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year. Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers for music, TV, gaming and other services by the end of calendar 2020.\n\nApple's share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there.\n\nApple posted $91.8 billion in revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with analyst estimates of $88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple reported earnings per share of $4.99, compared with analyst estimates of $4.55 per share.\n\nThe company forecast $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of $62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year.\n\nApple has made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs and subscription gaming and television services last year. Services revenue was $12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of $13 billion, and up from $10.9 billion the year before.\n\n\"Services are important, but the trajectory is heading on target. I feel they've made good progress on that front,\" said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel.\n\nThe shift toward services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier.\n\nCook said the company's Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a \"rousing success\" and that it is \"very strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven't bought a new device.\"\n\nIPhone sales of $55.96 billion beat analyst estimates of $51.6 billion and year-before sales of $52 billion, snapping a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apple's biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company's forecast, calling the devices \"the strongest iPhone lineup we've ever had.\"\n\nBut Apple's wearables segment - which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch - hit $10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of $9.5 billion, up sharply from $7.3 billion the year before.\n\nCook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both. Cook said Apple does not have an estimate for when it will be able to fulfill demand for AirPods.\n\n\"We're working on both of those very hard,\" Cook told Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Headphones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installed_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Installed base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AirPods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch_Series_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Watch Series 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_11_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 11 Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Watch"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 23}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200128&t=2&i=1482648836&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG0R20I", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 9026}, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 9026, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1430966634", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-02-01", "time": "00:57:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-01T00:57:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-01T00:57:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-idUSKBN1ZV38I", "title": "China facing global isolation as virus toll rises", "body": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China faced mounting isolation in the face of increasing international travel curbs and flight suspensions on Saturday, as the death toll from a spreading coronavirus outbreak rose to 259.\n\nThe epidemic has led to mass evacuations of foreign citizens as world airlines halt flights, and risks exacerbating a slowdown in growth in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nChina's National Health Commission said there were 2,102 new confirmed infections in China as of Friday, bringing the total to 11,791. Around two dozen other countries have reported more than 130 cases.\n\nAll of the reported deaths from the virus have been in China.\n\nThe Russian military was to start evacuating Russian citizens from China on Monday and Tuesday, Interfax and TASS news agencies reported. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying the evacuations would be from regions that had been most affected by the outbreak.\n\nRussia, which has already restricted direct flights with its biggest trading partner, also said it was suspending visa-free travel for Chinese visitors and halting work visas.\n\nMost international cases have been in people who had recently traveled to or were visiting from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nHubei has been under a virtual quarantine for the last week, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down. Elsewhere, Chinese authorities placed growing restrictions on travel and business.\n\nIn Beijing, counters were set up at the entrances of housing estates, where volunteers wearing red arm bands and masks noted details of residents coming back from their hometowns after the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\n\"As long as I am properly protected and don't go to crowded places, I don't feel scared at all about my hometown or Beijing,\" said a 58-year-old migrant worker surnamed Sun.\n\nOthers were more worried.\n\n\"There will be a huge number of people returning to the city. I think it will put Beijing at risk of more infections,\" said Zhang Chunlei, 45, another returning migrant worker.\n\nIn Hubei, the provincial government extended the holiday break to Feb. 13 in a bid to contain the outbreak, the Hubei Daily reported.\n\nThe World Health Organization, which this week declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, has said global trade and travel restrictions are not needed.\n\nBut Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to ban foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering their territories. Australia followed suit on Saturday.\n\n\"We're in fact operating with an abundance of caution in these circumstances so Australians can go about their daily lives with confidence,\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Sydney.\n\nThe Chinese data would suggest the flu-like virus is less deadly than the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people of the some 8,000 it infected, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.\n\nThe list of international airlines suspending all or some flights to China is growing.\n\nThe latest were Qantas Airways Ltd and Air New Zealand, who said travel bans forced them to suspend their direct flights to China from Feb. 9. All three major U.S. airlines said on Friday they would cancel flights to mainland China.\n\nThe commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific banned travel to China for all service members and civilian personnel under his authority and ordered those now in China to leave immediately, officials said.\n\nU.S. health officials on Saturday confirmed an eighth case of the virus, a person in Massachusetts who recently returned from Hubei province.\n\nMany nations have sent charter flights to repatriate citizens from China and then place them in isolation for around two weeks, believed to be the incubation period of the virus.\n\nGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn called for calm and warned against hysteria as more than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt, none showing any symptoms of the virus. As of Saturday evening Germany had eight confirmed cases.\n\nBritain, which has had two confirmed cases, said it was withdrawing some staff from its embassy and consulates in China.\n\nMany of the private clinics catering to foreigners in China have started to turn away people with fevers.\n\n\"I don't want to go to the local hospital with a sore throat only to catch something else,\" said Czech national Veronika Krubner in Tianjin.\n\nInfections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan, where the new virus is believed to have originated, raising concerns that new hot spots are emerging despite strict transport restrictions.\n\nIn Huanggang, authorities asked households to designate one individual who can leave the home, a local newspaper said. The mayor of the city of about 7.5 million people said there could be a significant rise in cases this weekend.\n\nThe northern city of Tianjin, home to some 15 million, suspended all schools and businesses until further notice.\n\nEfforts to contain the virus risk slowing economic growth in China. The virus impact prompted Goldman Sachs to cut its estimate for first-quarter growth to 4% from 5.6%.\n\nChina's central bank said the impact was temporary and economic fundamentals remained sound, but that it would increase credit support, lowering lending costs for affected companies.\n\nApple Inc said on Saturday it would close all of its official stores and corporate offices in China until Feb. 9, the latest of dozens of major companies, including IKEA and Walmart Inc, to restrict travel and operations due to the outbreak.\n\nFor a graphic comparing this with previous coronavirus

were on track for a fourth straight weekly loss on mounting worries about economic damage from the coronavirus that has spread from China to around 20 countries, killing more than 200 people.\n\nPrices briefly found support after Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Russia was ready to bring forward a meeting of OPEC and its allies to February from March to address a possible hit to global oil demand from the virus. [nL8N2A067O]\n\nNovak said he was in discussions with OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and that the oil-producing nations would need several more days to assess the impact and decide on the date of the meeting.\n\n\"The cartel stands ready to act again if necessary but may accept the short-term pain for now on the expectation that the economic consequences won't be as bad as people fear and price will bounce back to more acceptable levels on its own,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 fell 20 cents to $58.09 a barrel by 12:53 p.m. EST (1753 GMT), down 4.1% on the week.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 fell $1 to $51.14 a barrel, down 5.7% on the week.\n\nThe losses came after both benchmarks had risen more than $1 a barrel early in the session.\n\nGlobal equity markets were poised for their first monthly loss since August and Wall Street's main averages tumbled more than 1% on Friday, as mixed corporate earnings added to worries over the impact of the coronavirus.\n\nDisruptions in supply chains and travel curbs prompted economists to temper growth expectations for China, the world's second-largest economy.\n\nGoldman Sachs said the outbreak was likely to shave 0.4 percentage point from China's economic growth in 2020 and could also drag the U.S. economy lower.\n\nThe outbreak could cut China's oil demand by more than 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter, analysts said.\n\n\"It seems almost certain that the coronavirus will curb Chinese economic growth and commodities demand this quarter,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a note.\n\n\"Should the coronavirus have a comparable effect as SARS, it could reduce China's oil demand by roughly 400,000 barrels per day.\"\n\n(Graphic: China oil demand year-on-year change, here)\n\nMany companies in China planned to return to work on Friday after a week-long celebration of the Lunar New Year holiday, but authorities ordered businesses in many areas to stay shut longer to contain the disease.\n\nGrowth in China's factory activity faltered in January. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.0 from 50.2 in December, China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction.\n\nA Reuters poll on Friday indicated oil prices should remain supported near current levels this year as political risks and OPEC-led output curbs offset growing supply.\n\nThe poll of 50 economists and analysts was conducted mainly before the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n(Graphic: Average 2020 Brent and WTI forecasts, here)\n\nOPEC oil output plunged in January to a multi-year low as top exporter Saudi Arabia and other Gulf members overdelivered on a new production-limiting accord and Libyan supply dropped due to a blockade of ports and oilfields, a Reuters survey found.\n\nStill, global supplies remain abundant. U.S. crude production climbed 203,000 bpd to a record 12.9 million bpd in November, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType":

some flights to China as demand fell sharply and global companies told their employees not to travel on deepening fears over the spread of a flu-like virus.\n\nThe coronavirus that originated in the city of Wuhan has killed 106 people in China and spread across the world, rattling financial markets.\n\nThe United States warned that Americans should reconsider visiting China, while Britain advised against all but essential travel to mainland China. South Korea also advised its citizens to stay away.\n\nFacebook (FB.O) became the first major U.S. company to announce a travel suspension after the U.S. government's warning, saying it had asked employees to halt non-essential travel to mainland China and to work from home if they had traveled there.\n\nChicago-based United said it was suspending 24 U.S. flights to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai between Feb. 1 and Feb. 8 due to a significant drop in demand.\n\nEurope's biggest bank, HSBC (HSBA.L), banned all staff travel to Chinese-ruled Hong Kong for two weeks and to mainland China until further notice, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.\n\nThe British-based lender, which has the largest presence among foreign banks in China, also asked staff who have recently visited the country to undergo a self-imposed 14-day quarantine. The virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days.\n\nU.S. rival Goldman Sachs (GS.N) imposed similar measures, according to a memo seen by Reuters.\n\nIn South Korea, home appliances maker LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS) put a complete ban on travel to China and has advised employees on business trips in the country to return home as quickly as possible, a company spokeswoman said.\n\nSouth Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) said it was urging employees to avoid all non-essential travel to China, while banking group Standard Chartered (STAN.L) restricted travel to both mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\nIn Germany, auto supplier Webasto, which has 11 sites in China, including in Wuhan, has halted all corporate travel to and from China after an employee was infected.\n\nJapan's Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) said it recommended employees avoid travel to China, while Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) said it plans to evacuate its Japanese staff and their families in Wuhan via a government-chartered flight.\n\nAside from United, other airlines said they were adjusting schedules as companies reassessed the risk of travel to China.\n\nSouth Korean budget carrier Air Seoul said it will halt all flights to China, while Taiwan's China Airlines (2610.TW) rescheduled and canceled some flights to China to Feb. 10.\n\nHong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK) said it was reducing overnight layovers for crew at all points in mainland China as much as possible, resulting in some changes to its flight schedule.\n\nInternational SOS, a medical and travel security services firm that advises companies on travel, said its guidance for now was that business travel to China outside Wuhan's province of Hubei could continue.\n\nBut this could be updated if there were major flight cancellations throughout China and more disruptions to ground transport, International SOS Regional Security Director James Robertson said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType":

as countries rush to evacuate...", "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that China was sure of defeating a \"devil\" coronavirus that has killed 106 people, but international alarm was rising as the outbreak spread across the world.\n\nThe United States said it was expanding screening of arrivals from China from five to 20 airports and would consider imposing further travel curbs.\n\n\"All options for dealing with infectious disease spread have to be on the table, including travel restrictions,\" said U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar.\n\nFrom France to Japan, governments were organising evacuations, while Hong Kong - scene of anti-China unrest for months - planned to suspend rail and ferry links with the mainland.\n\nAmong countries pulling nationals out of Wuhan, the central Chinese city of 11 million where the outbreak started, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said a chartered plane would pick up its consular staff on Wednesday. The European Commission said it would help fund two aircraft to fly EU citizens home, with 250 French nationals leaving on the first flight.\n\nWorld Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Xi met in Beijing to discuss how to protect Chinese and foreigners in areas affected by the virus and possible evacuation alternatives, a WHO spokesman said.\n\n\"The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide,\" state television quoted Xi as saying.\n\n\"China will strengthen international cooperation and welcomes the WHO participation in virus prevention ... China is confident of winning the battle against the virus.\"\n\nThe UN agency said later that China had agreed that the WHO can send a team of international experts \"as soon as possible\" to increase understanding of the virus and guide the global response.\n\nInvestors are fretting about the impact of the crisis on the world's second-biggest economy, though stock markets rebounded on Tuesday following a sharp sell-off the previous day.\n\nUnited Airlines said it was suspending some flights between the United States and China for a week from Feb. 1 due to a \"significant decline in demand\", while Facebook Inc and other global companies restricted employee travel to the country.\n\nThe flu-like virus has spread overseas, but none of the 106 deaths has been outside China and all but six were in Wuhan, where the virus emerged last month, probably from illegally traded wildlife.\n\nHowever, cases in Germany, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan where the virus has spread person-to-person - as opposed to a visitor from China arriving - have heightened concern.\n\n\"The reported human-to-human transmission in Germany and Japan is unsurprising to see,\" said Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at Britain's University of Southampton.\n\n\"We will continue to see further similar cases outside of China, but the indications are at this stage that onwards transmission will be limited, so there will likely not be too many cases for example across Europe, and on a much lesser scale than we are seeing in China.\"\n\nChinese-ruled Hong Kong said high-speed rail services to the mainland would be suspended from midnight on Thursday, while the number of flights would be halved. Chinese authorities later said they would stop issuing travel permits for mainland tourists to visit Hong Kong and neighbouring Macau.\n\nBritain advised against all but essential travel to mainland China, excluding Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nThailand confirmed six more infections among visitors from China, taking its tally to 14, the highest outside China. France had a fourth confirmed case, an elderly Chinese tourist who was said to be in a serious condition.\n\nWuhan is under virtual quarantine, with a lockdown on transport and bans on gatherings. Tens of millions in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, live under some form of travel curb.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases in China surged to 4,515 as of Monday from 2,835 the previous day, the government said.\n\nCommunist Party-ruled China has been eager to show it is transparent over this outbreak, after initially covering up the extent of the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that killed about 800 people globally.\n\nKnown as \"2019-nCoV\", the newly identified coronavirus can cause pneumonia and, like other respiratory infections, it spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes. It is too early to know what its death rate will be, since there are likely to be many cases of milder disease going undetected.\n\nIt has an incubation of between one and 14 days.\n\nA WHO panel of 16 independent experts twice last week declined to declare an international emergency.\n\nConfirmation of any sustained human-to-human spread of the virus outside of China, as well as any documented deaths, would bolster the case for reconsidering.\n\nTedros can reconvene the panel on very short notice as needed, the WHO said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

prices, counter-balanced by talk that OPEC could extend oil output cuts.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 rose 30 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $59.81 per barrel. U.S. crude Clc1 ended at $53.33, down 15 cents or 0.3%.\n\nFinancial markets are trying to assess economic fallout as the virus spreads out of China where the death toll continues to rise, while airlines cut flights to China.\n\n\"Following the outbreak of coronavirus, commodities markets suffered from a technical selloff,\" said Michel Salden, senior portfolio manager of Vontobel Asset Management. But oil prices would likely rebound soon after a 14% drop so far, far more than the fall in stock markets.\n\nMajors airlines, including American Airlines, British Airways and Lufthansa, have suspended direct flights to and from mainland China due to the outbreak.\n\nJet fuel demand has slumped in Asia as airlines have canceled connections.\n\nU.S. crude inventories grew more than expected last week, while gasoline stocks hit record highs for a second week in a row, the Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report.\n\nCrude inventories USOILC=ECI rose by 3.5 million barrels in the week to Jan. 24, as refiners cut runs and demand for gasoline and diesel slipped. Gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI rose for a 12th straight week to an all-time high at 261.2 million barrels, the EIA said.\n\n\"We have seen a number of refinery maintenance announcements both planned and unplanned over the past week or two, and that is reflected in a setback for refinery operations,\" Anthony Headrick, energy market analysts at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries wants to extend production cuts, currently planned till the end of March, until at least June, and could deepen reductions should oil demand in China fall significantly due to the coronavirus, OPEC sources said.\n\nOPEC and its allies, including Russia, have been trying to stabilize prices in the face of sagging global demand and rising supplies, particularly from the United States.\n\n\"Will deeper OPEC supply curbs provide the panacea for the current oil market malaise? Probably not,\" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM. \"The oil cartel, therefore, faces an uphill battle to support oil prices.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A rapidly spreading virus outbreak in China is emerging as a potentially major new risk to the global economy and leaving policymakers, still grappling with the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war, fretting over the widening fallout.\n\nIn a sign of alarm over the possible damage, Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya said on Thursday China's huge presence in the world economy must be taken into account in gauging the impact the outbreak could have on global growth.\n\nStocks around the world tumbled on Thursday as the death toll from the spread of the coronavirus reached 170, forcing airlines to cut flights and some stores to close.\n\nThe potential impact on the world economy from the outbreak took center stage in U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's news conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"China's economy is very important in the global economy now, and when China's economy slows down we do feel that - not as much though as countries that are near China, or that trade more actively with China, like some of the Western European countries,\" Powell said.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also voiced concern on Thursday, saying he was closely watching the impact on Japan's economy including declining inbound tourism.\n\nZhang Ming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank, projected the outbreak would cut China's first-quarter growth by one percentage point to 5% or lower.\n\nChina has imposed travel restrictions and shut businesses to contain the outbreak, but has not quelled rising concern among companies and governments across the world.\n\nAsian stocks sank on Thursday as the death toll from the virus rose and more cases were reported around the world.\n\n\"Apart from the risk to human lives, it is likely to hit travel and consumption activities. In a scenario of widespread infection, it could materially weaken economic growth and fiscal positions of governments in Asia,\" S&P said on Thursday.\n\nAnalysts are comparing the current coronavirus outbreak to the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which led to about 800 deaths and slowed Asia's economic growth.\n\nMany say the impact on global growth could be bigger this time as China now accounts for a larger share of the world economy, a view echoed by BOJ's Amamiya.\n\nThe number of Chinese tourists visiting Japan has increased by more than 20 times since then, Amamiya said. \"The outbreak also spread during China's Lunar (New Year) holiday, when consumption tends to peak,\" he added.\n\n\"We're looking very carefully at developments, including how much the impact could spread,\" Amamiya said in a seminar in Tokyo hosted by Jiji news agency.\n\nThe fallout from the epidemic casts a shadow over the Bank of Japan's projection that global growth will pick up around mid-year and help Japan's economy sustain a moderate recovery.\n\nChina is Japan's second-largest export destination. The Chinese make up 30% of all tourists visiting Japan and nearly 40% of the total sum foreign tourists spent last year, an industry survey showed.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinzo_Abe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shinzo Abe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ming dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Social_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Academy of Social Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200129&t=2&i=1483164999&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG0S24M", "eventUri": null, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 4949}, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 4949, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1430274734", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-31", "time": "12:27:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-31T12:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-31T12:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4274509847164154, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-business-impact-idUSKBN1ZU1LG", "title": "Companies feel impact of coronavirus outbreak in China", "body": "(Reuters) -

announced plans on Tuesday to screen all arrivals from China for symptoms of the coronavirus and confirmed six more infections among such visitors, taking its tally to 14, health officials said.\n\nThai tourist authorities meanwhile said the number of Chinese tourists to Thailand was expected to fall by 2 million to 9 million this year due to the coronavirus outbreak in China.\n\nThais were also advised to avoid non-essential travel to China, Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary, told a news conference.\n\nThe death toll from the outbreak now stands at 106, although there have been no fatalities outside China.\n\nThailand has the second-largest number of cases outside China, though it is far lower than the 4,515 infections in China.\n\nFive of the patients among Thailand's new cases, aged between 6 and 70, came from China's Hubei province, and belonged to the same family, health official Tanarak Plipat told reporters. The sixth was from Chongqing city in southwestern China.\n\nOne passenger from among the family of seven traveling together was taken to hospital after showing symptoms on arrival, added Tanarak, the deputy director-general of the department of disease control.\n\nThe other four family members were quarantined after showing symptoms following monitoring, he added.\n\n\"Now we will expand screening to all Chinese from China and prepare equipment to screen 100%,\" Sukhum said.\n\nThailand had earlier screened passengers only from China's central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, its southern city of Guangzhou and northeastern Changchun across five airports, from Suvarnabhumi in Bangkok to those at Chiang Mai, Don Mueng, Phuket and Krabi.\n\nThe Tourism Authority of Thailand said it expected the number of Chinese tourists to fall by 2 million to 9 million this year due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nTourism has been hit hard by China's ban on all group tours as China is Thailand's biggest source of visitors.\n\nReduced travel from China could result in 50 billion baht ($1.52 billion) of lost tourism revenue, the tourism ministry estimates.\n\nTAT will propose to the government measures to help the industry, TAT Governor Yuthasak Supasorn told a news conference.\n\n(This story corrects to say Chongqing is a city, not a province, in China)", "source": {"uri":

half a million South Koreans have signed a petition calling for a ban on visitors from China as Seoul announced on Tuesday it would evacuate citizens from the epicenter of the new coronavirus outbreak.\n\nA petition filed with the presidential Blue House last week had gathered more than 540,000 signatures by Tuesday, highlighting a growing fear in South Korea that the coronavirus could spread.\n\nSouth Korea has found four cases of the virus.\n\nThe first was a Chinese national but the other three are South Koreans who traveled from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak started.\n\nThat has not stopped the calls for Chinese visitors to be banned.\n\n\"Coronavirus is spreading from China. Even North Korea is banning Chinese people from entering,\" wrote the anonymous author of the petition, adding that even a temporary ban would help stop the virus from spreading too widely.\n\nThe Blue House has not directly responded to the petition. When asked about other countries' bans on Chinese entries, its spokesman said only that the issue should be handled in close consultation with the World Health Organization.\n\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because many of its details are still unknown. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. It is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads.\n\n\"The government must respond to the petition and come up with strong measures such as barring Chinese tourists,\" said a passerby in Seoul, a man in his 50s who only gave his surname Chae. He was wearing a surgical mask.\n\nKim Eun-kyung, 40, a social worker with two children, said she was also concerned about the outbreak but she also worried that a ban on visitors could upset China and bring \"political, economic risks\".\n\nThe South Korean government says it is making \"all-out efforts\" to head off an outbreak and announced it would send at least four flights to Wuhan this week to evacuate nearly 700 South Korean citizens.\n\n\"We've come to this decision because our citizens there can't return on their own due to the lockdown in the region, and they were unable to get proper medical treatment as local clinics are at full capacity,\" vice foreign minister Lee Tae-ho told a briefing.\n\nPeople hoping to leave would be screened before they boarded the flights, he said.\n\nThe evacuated citizens are expected to be quarantined for about two weeks at two government facilities south of Seoul.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Moon Jae-in visited a hospital that had been treating one of the four patients, and sent a message to Chinese President Xi Jinping promising to help contain the spread of the virus.\n\n(The story refiles to correct headline to 'S.Koreans')",

outbreak", "body": "BENGALURU (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak in China could hit profits at luxury car brands Jaguar and Land Rover, parent Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) said on Thursday, the latest company to warn of an impact from the epidemic that has killed 170 people and forced businesses to suspend operations.\n\nIt could hamper JLR production in China as the epidemic has raised concerns that thousands of Chinese factory workers on extended Lunar New Year holidays may struggle to get back to work next week due to extensive travel restrictions.\n\nThe Indian carmaker said the outbreak could impact its profit margin forecast of around 3% for the JLR unit in fiscal 2020 at a time when it was making progress on a turnaround plan to improve sales in China.\n\nSeveral companies including Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Starbucks (SBUX.O) have warned of a possible impact from the outbreak.\n\n\"We need to see when people come back and resume work, how soon they can replenish pipeline inventory,\" Chief Financial Officer PB Balaji said as the company reported its third-quarter results.\n\nA 24% rise in sales at Jaguar and Land Rover in China in the quarter, however, helped the company beat profit expectations.\n\nTata Motors said it expects capital spending at JLR to rise to 4 billion pounds ($5.26 billion) in 2021 from 3.6 billion pounds in 2020.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the company said JLR Chief Executive Officer Ralf Speth will retire from the role in September, but will stay as non-executive chairman.\n\nThe carmaker reported net profit of 17.38 billion rupees ($245 million) in the third quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of 269.93 billion rupees a year earlier, when it booked an impairment charge related to the JLR unit.\n\nAnalysts, on average, were expecting a profit of 10.19 billion rupees, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nTata Motors last year mapped a revival plan for JLR and decided to cut around 10% of its workforce, following a drop in sales at the unit.\n\nThe company's overall revenue from operations fell 6.8% to 716.76 billion rupees in the quarter as its home market, India, faces an economic slowdown.\n\nTata Motors, like the rest of the auto industry in India, has been struggling with tighter credit and higher insurance costs, which have bruised demand and caused a pile-up of inventory.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_Land_Rover", "type": "org", "score": 5,

On Thursday, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global emergency.\n\nStatistics from China indicate that just over 2% of people known to be infected with the virus have died, suggesting that it may be less deadly than the coronaviruses behind Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\n\nBut disease experts caution that it will take several more weeks to be confident of how the new virus behaves given how quickly it has spread and the fact that a reliable diagnostic test has only recently been introduced.\n\n\"Not everybody is being seen, not everybody is being tested,\" Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Reuters.\n\n\"All the experts, myself included, tell the public that there is much we don't know about this virus and we are learning as we go along. That is not so reassuring.\"\n\nSome experts question whether the new virus shares similarities with seasonal flu, which has a low mortality rate but infects so many people that more than half a million may die from it each year, according to global health estimates.\n\nGRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus here\n\nThe latest statistics indicate a fatality rate of about 2.2%, but the actual rate may be higher or lower as there are likely more unconfirmed cases, he said.\n\nThe SARS virus killed about 10% of all infected individuals, while the MERS outbreak identified in 2012 had a fatality rate of around 35%.\n\nIn emerging infectious disease outbreaks, the most serious cases are identified first. Coronavirus infections can range from mild cold-like symptoms to severe cases that cause pneumonia, acute respiratory illness and death.\n\nAbout 20% of confirmed cases in the China coronavirus outbreak are classified as severe, similar to SARS and MERS, Schaffner said.\n\nGRAPHIC: Online package of China virus news here\n\nThe previously unknown strain is believed to have originated late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan.\n\nWithin weeks it appeared capable of being transmitted from one person to another via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n\n\"The rapidity of this outbreak is startling and certainly much more rapid than SARS,\" said Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain's University of Nottingham.\n\nThe incubation period is estimated between one and 14 days, and there have been anecdotal accounts of \"symptomless spreading\" by someone who is infected but unaware of it.\n\nNeil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College London, says that is too early to know if so-called \"super-spreader\" events seen with MERS and SARS is happening with the new coronavirus.\n\nSome 60 million people are under virtual lockdown in China's Hubei province - of which Wuhan is the capital. Australia, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand and Indonesia are quarantining evacuees from China for at least two weeks.\n\nMany global airlines have suspended or scaled back direct flights to China's major cities.\n\nExperts say China has been more forthcoming with information than it was during its 2003 SARS outbreak, but there are still concerns about how much data they are sharing.\n\nSome also questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine attempt on millions of people.\n\n\"That kind of thing can backfire. It can make it harder to get resources in,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

countries around the world are evacuating or planning to evacuate diplomatic staff and citizens from parts of China hit by the new coronavirus.\n\nFollowing are some countries' evacuation plans, and how they aim to manage the health risk from those who are returning.\n\n- Hundreds of South Koreans flown home on a charter flight from China were greeted with welcome signs on Friday as they arrived at quarantine centers where nearby residents had staged protests only a day before. The 368 South Koreans were transported to two facilities in Asan and Jincheon, cities about 80 km (50 miles) south of the capital Seoul, where they will be isolated. The aircraft carrying the evacuees from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in China, landed in Seoul earlier.\n\n- A third chartered flight repatriating Japanese people arrived from Wuhan on Friday, bringing the number of repatriated nationals to 565. Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Japan is making arrangements to repatriate all Japanese who want to return from Wuhan and surrounding areas, but that a fourth plane is unlikely to be dispatched this week.\n\n- A plane carrying 83 British and 27 European Union nationals from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, landed in Britain on Friday. The returning Britons will be quarantined for 14 days at an NHS facility in northwest England.\n\n- Kazakhstan has asked Beijing to allow 98 Kazakh students to leave Wuhan.\n\n- Germany will evacuate 90 citizens from the Wuhan area.\n\n- Morocco will evacuate 100 citizens, mostly students, from around Wuhan.\n\n- Spain's government is working with China and the European Union to repatriate its nationals.\n\n- The United States evacuated 220 citizens from Wuhan including 50 diplomats and contractors.\n\n- Canada has about 167 nationals in the Wuhan area, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said. While he did not rule out evacuations, he did not indicate there were any planned, adding that consular requests would be evaluated on a case by case basis.\n\n- Russia said it would begin moving its citizens out of China via its Far Eastern region on Feb. 1, regional authorities said. It plans to evacuate more than 600 Russian citizens currently in Hubei province and they will be quarantined for 14 days, Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said.\n\nIt has been in talks with China about evacuating its nationals from Wuhan and Hubei province.\n\n- The Netherlands has advised Dutch nationals to limit trips to essential travel only and is preparing the voluntary evacuation of 20 Dutch nationals and their families from Hubei Province, Foreign Minister Stef Blok said in a letter to parliament. The Netherlands is finalizing arrangements with EU partners and Chinese authorities.\n\n- Australia will help some citizens leave Hubei and quarantine them on Christmas Island. Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not say how many of the 600 Australians registered in the Hubei region could be helped, adding Australia would also be working to help New Zealand and Pacific island citizens.\n\n- New Zealand said on Thursday it would charter a plane to assist its citizens wanting to leave Wuhan. Consular teams will work with health officials to ensure the risks of transmission of the virus to New Zealand are carefully managed.\n\n- Indonesia is preparing to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan and will quarantine them for at least 14 days on arrival. Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said the government is working with Beijing authorities on the evacuation. She said that there were at least 243 Indonesians in areas declared to be in lockdowns, the majority in Wuhan.\n\n- France has evacuated some nationals from Wuhan and said it would place the passengers in quarantine. It said it would first evacuate nationals without symptoms and then those showing symptoms at a later, unspecified date.\n\n- Swiss authorities said they hope to have about 10 compatriots join the French evacuation of nationals from China.\n\n- Thailand said it was sending a plane to Wuhan to bring back its citizens on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

extends profit run, promises record production, driving stock...", "body": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) on Wednesday posted the second quarterly profit in a row on record vehicle deliveries and said it would deliver more than 500,000 units this year, as the electric carmaker's shares surged to new highs.\n\nShares rose 13% to $654 after hours, reaching an all-time high and for the first time cracking the $600 mark.\n\nTesla on Wednesday said the manufacturing process at its new Shanghai factory was running as expected and said it would increase production of its mass-market Model 3 due to strong demand in China.\n\nThe company also said it has started production of its new Model Y, an electric crossover utility vehicle, at its Fremont, California plant this month and plans to deliver the first models by the end of March, ahead of schedule.\n\nInvestors overall are betting that Tesla has overcome its production, legal and management struggles and is leading the industry on technological innovation for the next generation of cars.\n\nThe investor appetite also is a boon to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose mercurial behavior forced him to step down as chairman after a series of scandals and investor doubts about Tesla's ability to withstand competition from larger, better capitalized global rivals.\n\nTesla said it \"should comfortably exceed\" 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020, up from 367,500 last year.\n\nCost efficiencies and high production volumes should allow it to ultimately reach an industry-leading operating margin, the company said. It reported a 4.9% operating margin in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"The point Tesla is already starting Model Y production in Fremont was the most notable item in the release. For a company that has always been late, this is a big improvement. First they were looking at a late 2020 Model Y ramp, then pulled forward to summer time, and now we have production in 1Q20,\" Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin wrote in a note.\n\nThe company's cost efficiencies become apparent when comparing revenue and profit on a per-vehicle-basis. A review of Tesla's results showed that even though revenue per unit delivered rose by only 3% on a quarterly basis in the fourth quarter, operating profits per vehicle rose by roughly 19% in the same time. (Graphic: here)\n\nTesla's stock has more than doubled in value since the company posted a third-quarter profit, beat estimates for 2019 vehicle deliveries and ramped up production at its Gigafactory in China.\n\nThe latest rally pushed the company to a valuation of more than $104 billion and some analysts questioned the rationale.\n\n\"It has a fantastic brand, formidable manufacturing capabilities and (by all accounts) a fabulous product; but is it really worth more than Volkswagen,\" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett.\n\nTesla last week overtook the German company as the second most valuable carmaker behind Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).\n\nVolkswagen produced nearly 11 million vehicles in 2018 and reported an operating profit of 13.92 billion euros ($15.44 billion) in the same year.\n\nAs China tries to contain a rapidly spreading coronavirus, Tesla expects a delay of one and a half weeks in the ramp up of the Shanghai-built Model 3 due to a government-required factory shutdown.\n\nThe Model Y production in California and the Shanghai factory ramp-up are expected to \"temporarily weigh on margins.\"\n\nBoosted by strong demand for its vehicles in Europe and China, Tesla on Wednesday said its cash balance increased to $6.3 billion.\n\nIn the three last three months of 2019, total operating expenses rose less than 1% to $1.03 billion.\n\nAt the same time, however, Tesla's debt remains steady, amounting to $13.42 billion as of the end of 2019. (Graphic: here)\n\nThe company has been trying to keep a tight lid on costs but its new initiatives, which also include the construction of its first European factory in Germany, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features, are likely to put a strain on its cash pile.\n\nTesla's fourth-quarter results also mark only the fifth profitable quarter since the company began disclosing financial results after going public in 2010.\n\nThe company's financial results have fluctuated widely in the past and many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth.\n\nTesla is also trailing luxury carmaker rivals on steady profits per vehicle, a key metric closely watched by auto professionals to compare companies across the industry. (Graphic: here)\n\nNet income attributable to common shareholders fell to $105 million, or 56 cents per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, from $140 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, Tesla earned $2.06 per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.72 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue rose to $7.38 billion from $7.23 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.02 billion.
