Its doctors were in the front lines in the fight against cholera in Haiti and against ebola in West Africa in the 2010s.\n\nYet with the 52-strong brigade, this is the first time Cuba has sent an emergency contingent to Italy, one of the world's richest countries, demonstrating the reach of its medical diplomacy.\n\nThis is the sixth medical brigade Cuba has sent in recent days to combat the spread of the new disease abroad. It has sent contingents to socialist allies Venezuela and Nicaragua as well as Jamaica, Suriname and Grenada.\n\n\"We are all afraid but we have a revolutionary duty to fulfill, so we take out fear and put it to one side,\" Leonardo Fernandez, 68, an intensive care specialist, told Reuters late on Saturday shortly before his brigade's departure.\n\n\"He who says he is not afraid is a superhero, but we are not superheros, we are revolutionary doctors.\"\n\nFernandez said this would be his eighth international mission, including one in Liberia during the fight against ebola.\n\nItaly is the country that has been worst affected by the highly contagious virus that originated in China, with the northern region of Lombardy bearing the brunt of the contagion.\n\nIts death toll rose on Saturday by 546 to 3,095, according to its head of welfare, Giulio Gallera, who requested the Cuban doctors.\n\nWe are going to fulfill an honorable task, based on the principle of solidarity,\" said Graciliano D\u00edaz, 64.\n\nCuba built a healthcare system that was the envy of the developing world with economic aid from former ally Soviet Union, though some of those advances have been lost since the communist bloc collapsed.\n\nMany Cuban hospitals have fallen into disrepair and Cubans say they have difficulty finding medicine, a situation the government says is largely due to decades-old U.S. sanctions although analysts blame also the inefficient state-run economy.\n\nStill, Cuba has one of the highest ratios worldwide of physicians per capita even when excluding those doctors abroad, and its medical brigades for disaster relief continue to earn Havana goodwill worldwide.\n\n\"In a time of crisis, the Cuban government, the Cuban people ... have risen to the occasion, they have heard our appeal and they have responded,\" Jamaican Health Minister Christopher Tufton said on Saturday upon greeting 140 Cuban medical professionals at Kingston international airport.\n\nBritain also thanked Cuba last week for allowing a British cruise ship that had been turned away by several Caribbean ports to dock on the island and for enabling the evacuation of the more than 600 passengers onboard. [nL1N2BB1ZQ]\n\nMeanwhile Cuba, which is known for its disaster preparedness, is stepping up measures at home too to stem the coronavirus contagion. Twenty-five cases have been confirmed so far. [nL1N2BD2JM]\n\nPresident Miguel Diaz-Canel announced late on Friday the country would be closing its borders to foreign non-residents from Tuesday in a major blow to one of the motors of its cash-strapped economy, tourism.\n\nThousands of doctors and medicine students are also going door-to-door monitoring their local communities.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news",

China months before virus...", "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\n\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China's disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking to watch,\" said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. \"If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.\"\n\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.\n\nAs an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\n\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\n\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\n\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a \"cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia\" of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\n\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nDuring a press briefing on Sunday shortly after this story was first published, President Donald Trump dismissed the Reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the CDC that he described as \"100 percent wrong,\" without addressing whether the role had been eliminated.\n\nU.S. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield maintained the agency's presence in China \"is actually being augmented as we speak,\" without elaborating.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters before the report was published, the CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington's ability to get information and \"had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.\"\n\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser \"started well before last summer and was due to China's excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.\"\n\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as \"mentors\" to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors' specific role or expertise.\n\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\n\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country \"has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.\"\n\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government's suppression of information.\n\n\"In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn't have made a big difference,\" Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. \"The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn't.\"\n\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield's conversations with \"Chinese colleagues.\"\n\nRedfield learned that \"this looks to be a novel coronavirus\" from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,\" the official said.\n\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\n\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\n\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\n\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n\n\"Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,\" Azar said. \"We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?\"\n\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\n\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its \"censorship\" of medical professionals and media.\n\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the \"Chinese virus\" - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\n\nThe decision to eliminate Quick's job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n\n\"We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,\" the same expert said.\n\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. \"It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability\" it said.\n\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. COVID-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness.\n\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China's disease control agency, the sources said.\n\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people.\n\nNevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\n\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, \"it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.\"\n\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\n\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n\n\"We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,\" Conway said.\n\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser's position, received China's highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\n\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China's leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n\n\"The message from the administration was, 'Don't work with China, they're our rival,'\" Frieden said.\n\nTrump's re-election campaign sent out a statement Sunday evening dismissing controversy about the CDC'S cut as a matter of politics.\n\n\"Democrats are eager to politicize the coronavirus crisis and weaponize it against President Trump, the statement said. \"In so doing, they're siding with the Chinese and providing cover for Beijing's cover-up.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

novel coronavirus that has exploded into a global pandemic can remain viable and infectious in droplets in the air for hours and on surfaces up to days, according to a new study that should offer guidance to help people avoid contracting the respiratory illness called COVID-19.\n\nScientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, attempted to mimic the virus deposited from an infected person onto everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting, such as through coughing or touching objects.\n\nThey used a device to dispense an aerosol that duplicated the microscopic droplets created in a cough or a sneeze.\n\nThe scientists then investigated how long the virus remained infectious on these surfaces, according to the study that appeared online in the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday - a day in which U.S. COVID-19 cases surged past 5,200 and deaths approached 100.\n\nThe tests show that when the virus is carried by the droplets released when someone coughs or sneezes, it remains viable, or able to still infect people, in aerosols for at least three hours.\n\nOn plastic and stainless steel, viable virus could be detected after three days. On cardboard, the virus was not viable after 24 hours. On copper, it took 4 hours for the virus to become inactivated.\n\nIn terms of half-life, the research team found that it takes about 66 minutes for half the virus particles to lose function if they are in an aerosol droplet.\n\nThat means that after another hour and six minutes, three quarters of the virus particles will be essentially inactivated but 25% will still be viable.\n\nThe amount of viable virus at the end of the third hour will be down to 12.5%, according to the research led by Neeltje van Doremalen of the NIAID's Montana facility at Rocky Mountain Laboratories.\n\nOn stainless steel, it takes 5 hours 38 minutes for half of the virus particles to become inactive. On plastic, the half-life is 6 hours 49 minutes, researchers found.\n\nOn cardboard, the half-life was about three and a half hours, but the researchers said there was a lot of variability in those results \"so we advise caution\" interpreting that number.\n\nThe shortest survival time was on copper, where half the virus became inactivated within 46 minutes.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aerosol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Allergy_and_Infectious_Diseases", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microscope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_Laboratories", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountain Laboratories"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Half-life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stainless steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200317&t=2&i=1504573153&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2G2BP", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 57487, "pinterest": 31}, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 57518, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1488158374", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-18", "time": "09:44:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-18T09:44:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-18T09:20:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-disinformation-idUSKBN21518F", "title": "Russia deploying coronavirus disinformation to sow panic in West,...", "body": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) -

It said that on social media, Russian state-funded, Spanish-language RT Spanish was the 12th most popular news source on coronavirus between January and mid-March, based on the amount of news shared on social media.\n\nThe EEAS declined to comment directly on the report.\n\nThe European Commission said it was in contact with Google (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).

He promised the companies swift regulatory approval.\n\nThough there were only four known cases in South Korea at that point, \"we were very nervous. We believed that it could develop into a pandemic,\" one attendee, Lee Sang-won, an infectious diseases expert at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Reuters.\n\n\"We acted like an army,\" he said.\n\nA week after the Jan. 27 meeting, South Korea's CDC approved one company's diagnostic test. Another company soon followed. By the end of February, South Korea was making headlines around the world for its drive-through screening centers and ability to test thousands of people daily.\n\nSouth Korea's swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the United States. Seven weeks after the train station meeting, the Koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections. New cases are falling off: Ninety-three were reported Wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier.\n\nThe United States, whose first case was detected the same day as South Korea's, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. About 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said Tuesday.\n\nAs a result, U.S. officials don't fully grasp how many Americans have been infected and where they are concentrated - crucial to containment efforts. While more than 7,000 U.S. cases had been identified as of Wednesday, as many as 96 million people could be infected in coming months, and 480,000 could die, according to a projection prepared for the American Hospital Association by Dr. James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\n\"You cannot fight what you cannot see,\" said Roger Klein, a former laboratory medical director at the Cleveland Clinic and previously an adviser to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on clinical laboratory issues.\n\nHow the United States fell so far behind South Korea, according to infectious disease experts, clinicians and state and local officials, is a tale of many contrasts in the two nations' public health systems: a streamlined bureaucracy versus a congested one, bold versus cautious leadership, and a sense of urgency versus a reliance on protocol.\n\nThe delayed and chaotic testing in the United States will cost lives, potentially including those of doctors and nurses, many medical experts predict. Already more than 100 people have died overall, and fears of rampant spread have led to extraordinary restrictions on social interaction, upending the U.S. economy, schools, hospitals and everyday life.\n\n\"It makes me feel like I'm living in a farce,\" said Dr. Ritu Thamman, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Even hospital staff who may have been exposed can't get a test, she said. \"We are a rich country but we don't have these kinds of things?\"\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump was tripped up by government rules and conventions, former officials and public health experts say. Instead of drafting the private sector early on to develop tests, as South Korea did, U.S. health officials relied, as is customary, on test kits prepared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some of which proved faulty. Then, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn't approve tests other than the CDC's until Feb. 29, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had begun.\n\nMeanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the CDC insisted for weeks on narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had recently been to China or other hot spots or had contact with someone known to be infected. As a result, the federal government failed to screen an untold number of Americans and missed opportunities to contain the spread, clinicians and public health experts say.\n\nSouth Korea took a risk, releasing briskly vetted tests, then circling back later to spot check their effectiveness. By contrast, the United States' FDA said it wanted to ensure, upfront, that the tests were accurate before they went out to millions of Americans.\n\n\"There are always opportunities to learn from situations like this one,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, who has been on the job only three months, told Reuters. \"But one thing I will stand firm on: We cannot compromise on the quality of the tests because what would be worse than no tests at all is wildly inaccurate test results.\"\n\nIn a statement, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said, \"This process has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.\" But he said \"more and more state labs have come online, increasing our public health system's ability to detect and respond to cases.\"\n\nBombarded by criticism amid a re-election campaign, Trump vowed on Friday to ramp up production of test kits in partnership with private companies and to make the diagnostic tests more widely available at hospitals and in-store parking lots. This week, the FDA said more than 35 universities, hospitals and lab companies had begun running their own tests, under the agency's revised policy.\n\nBut it may be weeks before enough tests are on hand to fill the need.\n\n\"The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that,\" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a House committee last week. \"That is a failing. Let's admit it.\"\n\nIt's a problem many Americans, accustomed to hearing they have the most advanced medical care in the world, find hard to fathom.\n\n\"I don't know how we messed this up so badly,\" said Ruth Blodgett, 65, whose husband of the same age couldn't get a coronavirus test on Saturday in an urgent care clinic outside Rochester, New York, even though he was coughing and the doctor ordered one for him. \"We got caught flat-footed. For America, that's unacceptable.\"\n\nAt the pivotal Jan. 27 meeting at the Seoul train station, South Korean government leaders told companies they were cleared for takeoff.\n\n\"They were told that the 'emergency use authorization' would be coming, so hurry up and develop the kits,\" said Lee Hyukmin, head of the coronavirus task force at the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine, who was at the meeting.\n\nOne of the companies was Kogene Biotech Co Ltd, whose test kit was the only one to work initially. The government announced its approval on Feb. 4.\n\n\"The government acted quickly,\" said Myoah Baek, an executive director at Kogene. The Korean CDC \"disclosed information on test methods so test kit makers were able to speed up development.\"\n\nLee Hyukmin of the Korean laboratory society said the government was swift - but not reckless.\n\n\"Of course, a kit that's approved in one week isn't as good as one that goes through a year of clinical trials,\" he said. So in the early days, Lee said, the government cross-checked cases to ensure the tests were working properly.\n\nCross-checking involved verifying that labs got the same result the government did on an initial pool of patient samples. As of last week, nearly 100 labs were available to perform tests nationwide, according to government figures.\n\nSouth Korea's rapid response to the new coronavirus resulted from scars of the past.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2015 outbreak of MERS, short for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, critics slammed then-President Park Geun-hye and her administration for a slow response and a lack of transparency. Public confidence waned in Park, who was impeached in 2017 following an unrelated corruption scandal.\n\nThe country had 186 MERS cases, more than anywhere outside the Middle East, including 38 deaths.\n\n\"We can't ever forget the incident. It is engraved in our mind,\" the Korean CDC's Lee Sang-won said. \"We were hurt so much, and we felt remorseful.\"\n\nOn Jan. 31, only days after the Seoul train station meeting, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency, citing a similar pronouncement from the World Health Organization.\n\nHHS oversees the separate operations of the FDA and CDC, key agencies involved in responding to the pandemic. The CDC was responsible for developing the initial test kits for the virus. Then, under longstanding protocols, the FDA needed to approve the test before it could be sent to state and local labs around the country. Private labs and large hospitals could develop their own tests or work off the CDC version.\n\nOn Feb. 3, amid the preparations to address the emergency, the FDA hosted an all-day conference at its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, which had been scheduled well before the outbreak. Regulators, researchers and industry representatives gathered to discuss the general process for putting diagnostic tests cleared under emergencies on the path to permanent approval by the FDA.\n\nThough coronavirus was now the hottest topic in global medicine, a broadcast of the meeting conveyed little sense of urgency about the epidemic sweeping the globe. It was mentioned in passing but regulators mostly stuck to their Powerpoint presentations.\n\nIn his remarks, Dr. Timothy Stenzel, who oversees the FDA's review of diagnostic tests, spoke broadly about the agency's mission to protect public health: \"It's our goal to be first in the world wherever possible to authorize new tests.\"\n\nCarolyn Hiller, a program director at the Medical Device Innovation Consortium, which hosted the event alongside FDA, said there were discussions with the agency about postponing the meeting because of the coronavirus outbreak, but both sides opted to go ahead.\n\n\"The whole coronavirus thing blew up in real time while this was happening,\" she said.\n\nStenzel did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the FDA acknowledged that the coronavirus was not a \"specific topic on the agenda.\" But it said the agency already was talking to test developers and \"the conference was timely and addressed issues important\" to firms and institutions looking to produce a test.\n\nThe following day, Feb. 4, the FDA greenlighted a CDC test kit for the virus.\n\nWeeks of chaos would follow.\n\nBy Feb. 8, some states and other public labs were complaining that the CDC's test wasn't working because of a flawed component that gave inconclusive results. Three days later, the CDC told the labs that it was manufacturing a new component.\n\nAs of mid-February, the federal government remained stuck in first gear. The CDC was the primary supplier of tests across much of the country, and other labs couldn't immediately deploy their own without the FDA's blessing.\n\nHHS said it has assigned a team of outside scientists to examine what went wrong with the CDC's initial batch of tests, such as whether there was a manufacturing defect, flawed design or contamination in the agency's lab. The precise problem has not been identified.\n\nThe CDC didn't send out new test kits until late February. Meanwhile, public health experts say, a crucial window was closing on containing the virus, which by then was known to have infected more than 60 people.\n\nThe U.S. emergency declaration issued in late January created additional hurdles that hindered a wider expansion in testing, according to former federal officials and lab professionals.\n\nThe declaration eased the way for drugmakers to pursue vaccines and antiviral treatments for COVID-19. But public health experts said that the same declaration made it harder to expand diagnostic testing outside the CDC.\n\nThat's because the declaration required diagnostic tests developed by individual labs, such as those at hospitals or universities, to undergo greater scrutiny than in non-emergencies - presumably because the stakes are higher.\n\n\"Paradoxically, it increased regulations on diagnostics while it created an easier pathway for vaccines and antivirals,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. \"There was a real foul-up with diagnostic tests that has exposed a flaw in the United States' pandemic response plan.\"\n\nDr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the CDC and FDA stuck to their conventional playbook for too long.\n\n\"Traditional public health thinking is,'Don't create widespread panic and don't go over the top. Keep the testing narrow in a precision rifle approach rather than a mass, shotgun approach,'\" Schaffner said. \"That failed in this instance. This virus acted differently and it overwhelmed the U.S. system. South Korea had a much better sense of what was happening.\"\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the CDC said: \"After finding out that some labs could not fully verify the test, CDC began working on a solution and identifying the source of the problem .... CDC, in conjunction with FDA, determined how to move forward and shared this information immediately with public health labs.\"\n\nThe CDC statement also suggested that the agency was not exclusively responsible for testing delays.\n\nThe CDC was \"not an impediment\" to getting large-scale commercial testing started, according to the statement. That was the role of the FDA, and as the initial U.S. cases were being detected in late January and early February, CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield highlighted the need for that agency to act, according to the CDC statement.\n\nAlberto Gutierrez, who led the FDA's office overseeing diagnostic testing from 2009 to 2017, said the agency proceeded with caution because it saw itself as the last line of defense against opportunistic companies looking to cash in on threats to public health. \"There is money to be made in an emergency, and a lot of people try to take advantage of that,\" Gutierrez said. \"The problem the FDA faces is, do you let it become the Wild West?\"\n\n\"The FDA had good intentions,\" he said.\n\nAs U.S. efforts faltered, South Korean officials cleared a test from a second company, Seegene Inc, on Feb. 12.\n\nWith many more tests in hand, health officials were well armed to attack a fast-moving virus and aggressively track down people who may have been exposed. This testing-backed offensive helped South Korea reduce the number of new cases over a matter of weeks, serving as a model for other countries grappling with the pandemic.\n\nIn mid-February, cases spiked at a secretive church in the southeastern city of Daegu. On Feb. 26, Daegu city officials said they would test every single member of the church, including those without symptoms.\n\nAs of March 10, Daegu said that it had tested almost all of the 10,000 members of the church in that area, and about 40% came back positive. The city, which now accounts for about three-quarters of total infections in South Korea, has seen new cases sharply drop. On Wednesday, officials announced 46 new cases compared to a peak of 741 cases on Feb. 29.\n\nThe country went from two approved test makers on Feb. 18 to five as of last week, according to the Korean CDC.\n\n\"To my surprise, test kit makers were able to boost production quickly,\" Korean CDC's Lee Sang-won said.\n\nBy Feb. 24, state and local labs in the United States were pleading with the FDA to relax its rules so the nation no longer had to rely so heavily on the CDC for testing. They asked Hahn, the FDA commissioner, for \"enforcement discretion\" so they could use their own lab-developed tests.\n\n\"We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories,\" Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and Grace Kubin, lab services director at the Texas Department of State Health Services, wrote to Hahn on Feb. 24 in a letter reviewed by Reuters.\n\nIn an interview, Becker, whose group represents more than 100 state and local health laboratories, called the letter a \"Hail Mary\" pass, an act of desperation.\n\n\"The entire lab community was really coming unglued. We knew we could develop tests and were very capable of doing that, but we felt hamstrung\" Becker told Reuters.\n\nHe said labs wanted FDA to make more tests available so they could run more patient samples at a faster pace.\n\nTwo days after receiving Becker's letter, the FDA commissioner said his agency was ready to approve new outside tests quickly - if its requirements for accuracy were satisfied.\n\n\"False diagnostic test results can lead to significant adverse public health consequences,\" Hahn wrote to the Association of Public Health Laboratories in a Feb. 26 letter, \"not only serious implications for individual patient care but also serious implications for the analyses of disease progression and for public health decision-making.\"\n\nUnder increasing pressure, the FDA relented and removed many of the bureaucratic obstacles. On Feb. 29, the agency said public and private labs, including academic medical centers, could start using their own tests before the FDA had completed its full review. Laboratories had 15 business days to submit a completed application, which could be approved retroactively.\n\nThat same day, the Trump administration confirmed the first death in the United States from the coronavirus, a man in his 50s in Washington state.\n\nOn March 2, Stenzel at the FDA's diagnostic testing office hosted a webinar for lab test developers, highlighting additional challenges, including a shortage of viral samples needed for validation of test results. Some labs also have reported shortages of other key supplies and ingredients, as well as the need for more trained personnel.\n\nAs U.S. regulators rewrote their policies, South Korean municipalities were opening roadside testing facilities across the country, collecting samples in minutes while people sat in their cars.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting last week in Congress, U.S. Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California and an emergency-room physician who treated patients during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, pressed the FDA commissioner and other members of the Trump administration on why South Korea was lapping the United States in its response.\n\n\"Why don't we have drive-through testing like South Korea?\" Ruiz asked leaders of the president's coronavirus task force.\n\nRuiz told Reuters the officials said they were working on it. On their own, some hospitals and communities have begun offering drive-through testing in Colorado, New York, Texas and elsewhere.\n\nIn recent days, as the public criticism grew louder, Trump appointed a testing czar to improve coordination across agencies. The FDA launched a 24-hour hotline for laboratories needing help to accelerate testing, approved two company applications for higher-volume testing and granted states the flexibility to authorize new tests so labs can bypass the FDA.\n\nDespite the new moves, Ruiz said he fears America is still weeks away from approaching what South Korea has accomplished. \"I think months have been lost here,\" Ruiz said. \"Maybe we should look into purchasing South Korea's tests.\"\n\nThat may happen. Both Kogene and SolGent Co, two of the COVID-19 test-makers approved in South Korea, said their companies have an eye on the U.S. market.\n\n\"The FDA asked us to proceed with applications quickly,\" Kogene executive Myoah Baek said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Koreans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1996 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Inc's YouTube, Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) warned on Monday that more videos and other content could be erroneously removed for policy violations, as the companies empty offices and rely on automated takedown software during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn a blog post, Google said that to reduce the need for people to come into offices, YouTube and other business divisions are temporarily relying more on artificial intelligence and automated tools to find problematic content.\n\nSuch software is not always as accurate as humans, which leads to errors, it added, however. And \"turnaround times for appeals against these decisions may be slower,\" it said.\n\nFacebook followed suit, saying it would work with contract vendors this week to send home all content reviewers home indefinitely, with pay.\n\nThe social media company drew public criticism last week for asking policy enforcers to continue coming to work, as it lacks secure technology to conduct moderation remotely.\n\nFacebook also said the decision to rely more on automated tools, which learn to identify offensive material by analyzing digital clues for aspects common to previous takedowns, has limitations.\n\n\"We may see some longer response times and make more mistakes as a result,\" it said.\n\nTwitter said it too would step up use of similar automation, but would not ban users based solely on automated enforcement, because of accuracy concerns.\n\nThe three Silicon Valley internet services giants, like many companies worldwide, have asked employees and contractors to work from home if possible, to slow the fast-spreading respiratory disease. Mass gatherings for sports, cultural and religious events have been canceled globally.\n\nGoogle said human review of automated policy decisions also would be slower for other products and phone support would be limited.\n\nIts content rules cover submissions such as campaigns on its ad network, apps uploaded to the Google Play store and business reviews posted to Google Maps.\n\n\"Some users, advertisers, developers and publishers may experience delays in some support response times for non-critical services, which will now be supported primarily through our chat, email, and self-service channels,\" Google said.\n\nThe content review operations of Google and Facebook span several countries, such as India, Ireland, Singapore and the United States.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200316&t=2&i=1504089013&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2F21D", "eventUri": null, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 35917, "pinterest": 3}, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 35920, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1485368161", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-16", "time": "10:08:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-16T10:08:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-16T10:07:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8941176533699036, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-idUSKBN2131B1", "title": "Another black Monday as coronavirus response upends Wall Street", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street suffered its biggest drop since the crash of 1987 on Monday after unprecedented steps taken by the Federal Reserve, lawmakers and the White House to slow the spread and blunt the economic hit of the coronavirus failed to restore order to markets.\n\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 12%, closing at its lowest level since December 2018, despite the Fed's surprise move late Sunday to cut interest rates to near zero, its second emergency rate cut in less than two weeks and ahead of a scheduled policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nIt was the third-largest daily percentage drop on record, beaten only by the 1987 \"Black Monday\" rout and the crash of October 1929.\n\nThat heightened alarm about the rapid spread of the pandemic and how it has paralyzed parts of the global economy and squeezed company revenue.\n\nInvestors appear increasingly worried about how effectively policymakers will be able to mitigate the economic damage from the spreading virus.\n\nStocks fell further late in the session as President Donald Trump urged Americans to halt most social activities for 15 days and not congregate in groups larger than 10 people, in a bold, new effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in the United States.\n\n\"There's nothing that can really give us a sense of when the full extent of the virus' impact will be known,\" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nTrump also said the United States may be heading into a recession.\n\nMost market watchers at this point are bracing for the likelihood that the economy is headed for a recession, but they said it is too early to know the full extent of the economic downturn.\n\nInvestors also are not yet convinced that all the rushed, panicked responses are gaining traction.\n\nBars, restaurants, theaters and movie houses in New York and Los Angeles were ordered shut, and U.S. states pleaded with the Trump administration to coordinate a national response to the outbreak.\n\nThe S&P 500 lost $2.69 trillion in market capitalization for the day, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, and the index is down 29.5% from its record high close on Feb. 19 and has lost$8.28 trillion in that time, based on S&P Dow Jones data.\n\nTrading on Wall Street's three main stock indexes was halted for 15 minutes shortly after the open as the S&P 500 index .SPX plunged 8%, crossing the 7% threshold that triggers an automatic cutout.\n\nThe real estate sector .SPLRCR was the weakest out of the S&P 500's 11 major sectors with a 16.5% dive, which was its deepest one-day percentage drop since 2009. The smallest loser was consumer staples .SPLRCS which sank 7% on the day.\n\nThe technology sector .SPLRCT fell 13.9%, which was a record one-day decline for the sector that was the biggest driver of the bull market.\n\nThe Cboe Volatility Index , known as \"Wall Street's fear gauge,\" ended the session at 82.69, its highest ever closing level.\n\nJim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, speaking of the VIX, said the market was in \"full panic mode.\"\n\n\"Until comfort returns, panic kind of dies down, I think we are going to continue to have big moves,\" he said.\n\nDespite the intense volatility, the markets should stay open, the head of the U.S. securities regulator said, quashing speculation that the government might shut down the country's exchanges to stop the plunge in stock prices.\n\nLance Pan, director of investment research and strategy at Capital Advisors group in Newton Massachusetts, said that he was trying to calm clients on Monday and noted the extra problems people were having from working from home.\n\n\"We're flying blind and traders, even though they talk to each other, they may not see the body language, they have kids with them,\" he said.\n\nSome 16.37 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 13.51 billion average for the last 20 sessions.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 14.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 11.64-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 341 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded three new

selloff on Wednesday and the Dow erased virtually the last of its gains since President Donald Trump's 2017 inauguration, as the widening repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic threatened to cripple economic activity.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index ended down 5.2%, though it pared losses late in the day as the U.S. Senate passed legislation to provide billions of dollars to limit the damage from the outbreak through free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave and expanded safety-net spending.\n\nIn a move likely to add to the anxiety, the Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N), owner of the New York Stock Exchange, said after the bell that the NYSE will temporarily close its trading floors and move fully to electronic trading beginning Monday.\n\nThe NYSE said a floor trader and an NYSE employee had tested positive for the coronavirus, but that they had not entered the stock exchange building. Trading and regulatory oversight of all NYSE-listed securities will continue without interruption, the exchange said.\n\nWith airports and hotels emptying and airlines asking staff to take unpaid leave to stem losses, the S&P 1500 airlines index .SPCOMAIR sank 20.8% on Wednesday. Shares in major hotel operators Hilton (HLT.N), Marriott (MAR.O) and Hyatt (H.N) fell by about 12% to 19%.\n\n\"The market's really reacting to fear and uncertainty and we don't think it's over until it finds a floor on stock prices. The floor will have to be found in containment of the viral spread and limiting the economic toll of the virus,\" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones.\n\nBy Wednesday's close, the Dow was up just 0.4% from where it was on Jan. 20, 2017, the day of Trump's inauguration, although it remains up almost 9% from when Trump unexpectedly won the presidential election on Nov. 8, 2016, often referred to as the \"Trump Bump.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 is now down about 29% from the record closing high it notched on Feb. 19, as the coronavirus-inspired selloff ended Wall Street's longest-ever bull run.\n\nIn one of the most dire forecasts yet issued for the potential hit from the epidemic, a JP Morgan economist said the U.S. economy could shrink 4% this quarter and 14% next quarter, and for the year it is likely to shrink 1.5%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1,338.46 points, or 6.3%, to 19,898.92, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 131.09 points, or 5.18%, to 2,398.1, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 344.94 points, or 4.7%, to 6,989.84.\n\nThe dramatic stimulus measures have only provided short-lived bounces in equities, with investors factoring in a global recession and worrying about the duration of the damage extending into the summer.\n\nWednesday's selling at one point triggered another 15-minute trading cutout at a 7% decline in yet another day of volatile trading. The Cboe Volatility index ended up at 76.45.\n\n\"This market went from a position of where we were fearless back at the beginning of February to some days like today where you feel hopeless about what's going on in the market,\" said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer of Vantagepoint Investment Advisers.\n\nThe day's worst-performing S&P sector was the S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY, which closed at its lowest level since early 2003. U.S. crude futures fell nearly 17% on Wednesday, having touched their lowest prices in 18 years.\n\nWorries about mass debt defaults or writedowns pressured U.S. lenders, sending the S&P 500 banking subsector .SPXBK down 7.9%.\n\nShares in plane maker Boeing Co (BA.N), long a symbol of U.S. tech and industrial power, sank another 17.9%.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 12.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 8.79-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and 294 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 11 new highs and 1,214 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 18.51 billion shares, compared to the 14.6 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_&_Poor's_Depositary_Receipts", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ-100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASDAQ-100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200318&t=2&i=1504842893&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2H11A", "eventUri": "eng-5610056", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "shares": {"facebook": 24286}, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 24286, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1486577676", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-17", "time": "07:10:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-17T07:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-17T07:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-swiss-idUSKBN2140SM", "title": "Swiss hospitals face collapse in 10 days if virus keeps spreading", "body": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's health care system could collapse by the end of the month if the new coronavirus keeps spreading at current rates, a government official warned on Tuesday.\n\nSwiss authorities estimated that 2,650 people had tested positive for the coronavirus and said 19 people had died, while predicting cases will likely soar in the weeks ahead.\n\nExact figures were unavailable. Daniel Koch, head of the Federal Office of Health's communicable diseases division, said the rapid rise had outstripped the state's ability to record new cases in real time.\n\nKoch urged residents to observe strict emergency measures ordered this week, including bans on events and gatherings, calling these critical in limiting the damage and protecting hospitals from a potential collapse.\n\n\"People who become infected today will only hit us in 10 days from now,\" Koch said at a news conference. \"We have to make sure the infection rate goes down today, because otherwise, in 10 days (Swiss hospitals) won't be able to handle it.\"\n\nSwitzerland has mobilised up to 8,000 military members to assist civil authorities and medical personnel.\n\nThe country of 8.6 million can muster 1,000 to 1,200 intensive care beds, although Koch said there was only limited staff to operate life-saving equipment like ventilators now in desperate demand in neighbouring Italy, where more than 2,100 have died.\n\nThis week the World Health Organization called on all countries to ramp up testing to slow the pandemic's advance, while urging companies to boost production of vital equipment to overcome shortages.\n\nIn an attempt to deal with growing numbers of suspected cases, a large blue tent was erected overnight outside the University Hospital of Geneva to screen and test the sick. A Reuters witness saw a handful of people ushered inside by an official wearing a mask and gloves on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe hospital said it was planning to double its intensive care capacity by adding more beds to existing rooms.\n\nKoch defended Switzerland's evolving policy to focus testing on people most at risk and those who might need hospitalisation, rather than trying to test every person with mild symptoms.\n\nThe government is urging those individuals - mostly younger, healthy people - to isolate themselves at home and halt contact with older or immune-compromised people.\n\n\"Initially you test as broadly as possible,\" Koch said. \"This phase is over in Europe.

Gold, the dollar and global equity markets rose on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve said it would buy short-term corporate debt directly from companies to help relieve credit markets under strain from the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nThe renewal of the financial crisis-era Commercial Paper Funding Facility, first used in 2008, will provide a backstop to that market, a key funding source for a range of U.S. businesses that have seen liquidity dry up.\n\nThe Fed said the Treasury would provide $10 billion of credit protection to the central bank's commercial paper operation.\n\nGold snapped a five-session decline on the funding effort and stocks on Wall Street rose further as the move eased growing fears of a liquidity crunch due to the coronavirus epidemic, which is smothering world economic activity as businesses shut and countries close borders.\n\n\"For commercial paper to seize up, that is an ominous sign of bad things to come,\" said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey.\n\n\"This certainly helps the plumbing of the financial system,\" he said.\n\nEquity markets in Europe rebounded and Wall Street climbed on a series of announcements from the Fed, the U.S. Treasury Department and the White House.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 2.26% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 3.50%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 1,048.86 points, or 5.2%, to 21,237.38, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 143.06 points, or 6.00%, to 2,529.19 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 430.19 points, or 6.23%, to 7,334.78.\n\nThe move to add liquidity to credit markets came as major central banks and commercial counterparts joined forces to alleviate broad shortages of dollar financing in global markets.\n\nThe Bank of Japan conducted an 84-day dollar funding operation valued at $30.272 billion, its biggest injection of dollar funds since 2008, and South Korea also pledged to act soon.\n\nWhile the funding backstop is important, it does not assist low-wage workers who are laid off due to the closure of restaurants, bars and other entertainment outlets, noted David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\n\"The question is, are authorities doing all that they can to soften the blow of the social distancing recession? I don't think we're there yet,\" Kelly said.\n\nA fiscal spending package is needed as \"there's going to be a lot of human misery out there,\" he added.\n\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump pursued an $850 billion stimulus package to buttress the economy, according to a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe package would include $50 billion for airlines hard hit by the pandemic and $250 billion for small business loans. Trump also said his administration is considering a plan to send Americans $1,000 checks within two weeks.\n\nBefore U.S. markets opened, equity and oil prices struggled to shake off coronavirus fears after Wall Street's worst rout since the Black Monday crash of 1987.\n\nThe Philippines became the first country to close its markets, and then said trading would resume, while France, Italy, Spain and Belgium curbed stock trading by banning short-selling to shield some of Europe's biggest companies from a sell-off.\n\nThe moves will temporarily halt bets on falling shares at scores of companies, from the world's largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), to Spanish bank Santander (SAN.MC) and Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA).\n\nThe dollar surged as companies and investors sought the most liquid currency and concerns about the coronavirus' economic impact dented risk appetite.\n\nThe three-month euro/dollar cross-currency basis swap spread EURCBS3M=ICAP rose as high as 120 basis points from less than 90 on Monday, putting the spread as its widest since late 2011 - the height of the euro zone debt crisis.\n\n\"Stress here is helping lift the USD,\" said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.\n\nAn early rebound in European markets was wiped out as the region's battered airline and travel stocks suffered a drubbing prior to the Fed's announcement. [.EU] .SXTP\n\nData showed German investor morale at lows last seen in the 2008 financial crisis, and rating agency S&P Global warned the inevitable global recession this year would lead to a spike in defaults.\n\nBrent crude fell below $30 a barrel to its lowest since 2016 as the pandemic hit oil demand while Saudi Arabia and Russia kept up their battle for market share.\n\nBrent LCOc1 futures slid $1.32 to settle at $28.73 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 futures fell $1.75 to settle at $26.95 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark has slumped more than 50% since Jan. 2.\n\nEarlier in the trading day, markets stabilized in Asia. Australian shares closed 5.9% higher, their biggest daily percentage gain since October 2008, after plunging nearly 10% on Monday.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares .MIAPJ0000PUS and Japan's Nikkei .N225 both finished steady.\n\nSome $2.7 trillion in market value was wiped from the S&P 500 on Monday as it suffered its third-largest daily percentage decline on record.

on Wednesday, with bond and gold prices also falling in an unusual tandem, as markets grappled with the sheer scale of government programs and handouts aimed at softening the economic shockwave from the coronavirus.\n\nThe Trump administration asked Congress to approve $500 billion in cash payments to taxpayers in two rounds starting April 6 and $50 billion in secured loans to U.S. airlines to address the outbreak's impact, according to a document seen by Reuters.\n\nTraders are struggling to sort out the various moves by global central banks and governments to shore up economies bracing for what looms as a short but deep global recession from a pandemic still on the rise.\n\nInvestors dumped precious metals and other safe-havens in favor of cash after the additional U.S. stimulus measures announced Tuesday failed to calm markets hit by mounting fears over the economic downside from the coronavirus.\n\nEstimates for the duration of the damage extend out into the summer. Japan already is in a recession, a downturn is imminent in Europe and a U.S. recession will start in the second quarter, a report from IHS Markit said.\n\nThe coronavirus has raised the prospect of the steepest ever annual fall in oil demand, Goldman Sachs said. U.S. crude futures plummeted to an 18-year low and Brent hit more than 16-year low as travel and social lockdowns slammed demand.\n\nCertain correlations are breaking down in the markets as typical safe-haven assets sell off, said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone Financial Inc in New York.\n\n\"During a dramatic risk-off situation you would expect to see at least a little bit of a bid in bonds or maybe in gold, but we're seeing the opposite,\" Abbasi said.\n\n\"Despite the continued pain in equities, the safe-haven asset correlation seems to be now trading with risk assets, rather than the inverse to them,\" he said.\n\nBond prices tumbled, instead of rising, as investors sold to raise cash. Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 1.257%, after earlier hitting 1.226%.\n\nIn Europe, the gap between German and other euro zone bond yields widened, with investors demanding higher premiums to hold anything but German debt.\n\nTen-year French government bonds yielded 69 basis points more than their German counterparts, the most since April 2017.The gap between 10-year German and Dutch debt grew as wide as 37basis points, the most since July 2015.\n\nGold dropped 2%, falling below $1,500 an ounce.\n\n\"Gold continues to suffer from risk-off panics in the market, trading back below $1,500 level,\" said Tai Wong, head of base and precious metals derivatives trading at BMO.\n\n\"Liquidity here, as in most markets, is deeply compromised and we expect to see continuing volatility, mood-driven swings,\" Wong said.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 6.26% and emerging market stocks lost 5.34%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 3.99%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,660.63 points, or 7.82%, to 19,576.75. The S&P 500 lost 177.29 points, or 7.01%, to 2,351.9 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 462.37 points, or 6.3%, to 6,872.41.\n\nBoeing Co fell another -22.1% as the planemaker called for a $60 billion bailout for U.S. aerospace manufacturers facing the fallout of an extended collapse in global travel.\n\nEuropean bourses tumbled, with indexes in London, Frankfurt and Paris plunged from 4% to 5%.\n\nIn Asia, the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 4% to lows last seen in summer 2016, led by a 6.4% fall in Australia. Japan's Nikkei dipped 1.7%.\n\nThe economic slowdown will be tough on travel-related industries, gaming and brick and mortar retail, said Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at real estate-focused CenterSquare Investment Management in Philadelphia.\n\nU.S. clothing retailer Gap Inc and luxury department store operator Neiman Marcus will close their stores for two weeks, joining other retailers in a vast effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"It's a little less obvious whether the government will start bailing out retailers. The problem is that a lot of these retailers were already teetering on a knife edge coming into this,\" Crowe said. \"There are very few industries right now that can sustain to a four- to eight-week shutdown.\"\n\nU.S. crude hit its lowest since March 2002, falling even after weekly government data was less bearish than expected. The draw on gasoline stockpiles and smaller-than-expected build in crude inventories showed that people were preparing ahead of business and school closings, analysts said.\n\nU.S. crude fell 18.18% to $22.05 per barrel.\n\n(Graphic: Market selloff speed, severity eclipses previous dislocations, here)\n\n\"We are in the midst of the mayhem really, and I think there is still a risk that the increasing number of infections will keep markets on their toes,\" said Hans Peterson, global head of asset allocation at SEB investment management.\n\n\"It is hard to know how deep the recession will be, and as long as we have that situation it is hard to lift sentiment.\"", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

richest nations poured unprecedented aid into the global economy on Thursday as coronavirus cases ballooned in the new epicentre Europe, with the number of deaths in Italy outstripping those in mainland China, where the virus originated.\n\nWith over 242,000 infections and nearly 10,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with painful periods such as World War Two, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu.\n\nU.N. chief Antonio Guterres warned that a global recession, \"perhaps of record dimensions\", was a near certainty.\n\n\"This is a moment that demands coordinated, decisive, and innovative policy action from the world's leading economies,\" Guterres told reporters via a video conference. \"We are in an unprecedented situation and the normal rules no longer apply.\"\n\nTourism and airlines have been particularly battered, as the world's citizens hunker down to minimize contact and curb the spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness. But few sectors have been spared by a crisis threatening a lengthy global recession.\n\nThe United States is urging Americans not to travel abroad at all and could announce restrictions at the U.S.-Mexican border on Friday. They would be similar to the closure of the U.S.-Canada border to non-essential traffic.\n\nMarkets have suffered routs unseen since the 2008 financial debacle, with investors rushing to the U.S. dollar as a safe haven. Wall Street tried to bounce back on Thursday. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX closed up 0.5%, still around 30% off highs reached last month. U.S. oil prices posted their largest one-day gain ever, rising 25%. [.N] [O/R]\n\nPolicymakers in the United States, Europe and Asia have slashed interest rates and opened liquidity taps to try to stabilise economies hit by quarantined consumers, broken supply chains, disrupted transport and paralysed businesses.\n\nThe virus, thought to have originated from wildlife in mainland China late last year, has jumped to 172 other nations and territories with more than 20,000 new cases reported in the past 24 hours - a new daily record.\n\nCases in Germany, Iran and Spain rose to more than 12,000 each. An official in Tehran tweeted that the coronavirus was killing one person every 10 minutes.\n\nInteractive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7\n\nBritain, which has reported 144 deaths, was closing dozens of underground stations in London and ordering schools shut from Friday.\n\nSome 20,000 soldiers were on standby, Queen Elizabeth headed for sanctuary in the ancient castle of Windsor, and the Tower of London was to close along with other historic buildings.\n\n\"Many of us will need to find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe,\" the 93-year-old monarch said in an address to the nation.\n\n\"I am certain we are up to that challenge,\" she added.\n\nItalian soldiers transported corpses overnight from an overwhelmed cemetery in Europe's worst-hit nation where 3,405 people have died, more than in mainland China. Germany's military was also preparing to help.\n\nSupermarkets in many countries were besieged with shoppers stocking up on food staples and hygiene products. Some rationed sales and fixed special hours for the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to severe illness.\n\nSolidarity projects were springing up in some of the world's poorest corners. In Kenya's Kibera slum, volunteers with plastic drums of water and boxes of soap on motorbikes set up handwashing stations for people without clean water.\n\nRussia reported its first coronavirus death on Thursday.\n\nAmid the gloom, China provided a ray of hope as it reported zero new local transmissions of the virus, a sign of success for its draconian containment policies since January. Imported cases accounted for all 34 new infections in China.\n\nIn the United States, where President Donald Trump had initially played down the coronavirus threat, infections surged with over 11,500 known cases and at least 186 deaths.\n\nTrump has infuriated Beijing's Communist Party rulers by rebuking it for not acting faster and drawn accusations of racism by referring to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese virus\".\n\n\"We continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus,\" he said in opening remarks at a briefing on Thursday.\n\nThe head of the U.S. National Guard said tens of thousands of its troops could be activated to help U.S. states deal with the outbreak now in all 50 states.\n\nIn a bewildering raft of financial measures around the world, the European Central Bank launched new bond purchases worth 750 billion euros ($817 billion). That brought some relief to bond markets and also halted European shares' slide.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve rolled out its third emergency credit programme in two days, aimed at keeping the $3.8 trillion money market mutual fund industry functioning. The Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.1%, its second emergency rate cut in just over a week.\n\nChina was to unleash trillions of yuan of fiscal stimulus and South Korea pledged 50 trillion won ($39 billion).\n\nThe desperate state of industry was writ large in Detroit, where the big three automakers - Ford Motor Co (F.N), General Motors Co (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) - were shutting U.S. plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico. Some automakers have pledged to help manufacture much needed medical supplies.\n\nWith some economists fearing prolonged pain akin to the 1930s Great Depression and others anticipating a bounceback, gloomy data and forecasts abounded.\n\nIn one of the most dire calls, J.P. Morgan economists forecast the Chinese economy to drop more than 40% this quarter and the U.S. economy to shrink 14% in the next. Ratings agency Moody's prepared for mass downgradings.\n\nIn Britain, small gin distilleries have started producing hand sanitizer amid a national shortage, a trend mirrored across the globe from Australia to the United States.\n\nAnd Monaco cancelled its showcase Formula One Grand Prix, the most famous and glamorous race on the calendar, in another high-profile sporting casualty of the

He said that some \"companies are already either sequestering a healthy group of their essential employees or are considering doing that and are identifying appropriate protocols to do that.\"\n\nMaria Korsnick, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that some of the nation's nearly 60 nuclear power plants are also \"considering measures to isolate a core group to run the plant, stockpiling ready-to-eat meals and disposable tableware, laundry supplies and personal care items.\"\n\nNeither group identified specific companies.\n\nElectric power plants, oil and gas infrastructure and nuclear reactors are considered \"critical infrastructure\" by the federal government. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is charged with coordinating plans to keep them operational during an emergency.\n\nA DHS spokesperson said that its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had issued guidance to local governments and businesses on Thursday asking them to implement policies to protect their critical staff from the virus.\n\n\"When continuous remote work is not possible, businesses should enlist strategies to reduce the likelihood of spreading the disease,\" the guidance stated. \"This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, separating staff by off-setting shift hours or days and/or social distancing.\"\n\nThe Great River Energy cooperative which runs 10 power plants serving 1.7 million customers in Minnesota, said it is preparing for the possibility of sequestering staff essential to running its operations. It has a supply of cots and blankets ready at its main control center if it decides to keep critical workers on site to keep them healthy.\n\n\"We saw this coming,\" said Mike McFarland, the co-op's director of enterprise risk management. He said Great River drafted a detailed pandemic plan after the H1N1 bird flu crisis in 2009 and dusted it off a few weeks ago.\n\nThe cooperative has currently only activated its \"medium threat level\" plan, which required it to configure facilities to give more space between employees and to allow non-critical employees to work from home.\n\nBut McFarland said sequestering could happen if the coronavirus hits the region hard. He said the protocol, which could keep workers from the outside world for weeks, would be \"effectively voluntary\" but did not elaborate. He said the company is planning for a scenario of losing up to two-thirds of its staff during the outbreak.\n\nReuters contacted a dozen other power providers, all of whom said they were implementing plans to moderate risks to their employees and to ensure continuity of service, but who declined to comment on whether sequestering staff was a possibility.\n\nIn New York, Consolidated Edison Inc (ED.N), which provides power to around 3.3 million customers and gas to about 1.1 million customers in New York City and Westchester County, said it was taking steps to keep critical employees healthy, including separating some control center personnel to other locations where they can perform their work.\n\nDuke Energy Corp (DUK.N), which provides power to 7.7 million customers in six states and gas to 1.6 million customers in five states, said it instituted additional worker screening measures, such as temperature checks, at generating and other critical facilities.\n\nPuget Sound Energy, which serves more than 1.5 million customers in a region hard hit by coronavirus, said all non-essential workers are working remotely, and the utility has limited access to facilities that provide critical operations.\n\nJimmy Slevin, president of the Utility Workers of America, a union representing 50,000 members, said the organization was aware that as the coronavirus outbreak develops, essential employees such as plant operators could be called on to work longer hours - or remain on site.\n\n\"There is only a certain amount of trained operators that run these power plants. We need to make sure their health is at the utmost,\" said Slevin.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

stocks rebounded on Thursday, halting further declines, in a sign further steps to boost liquidity by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks has tentatively calmed markets that still fear a coronavirus-induced slowdown.\n\nThe Fed's most recent move to reduce risk and loosen up tight markets, especially trading for Treasury securities, helped lift the dollar to a fresh three-year high against a basket of major currencies =USD and push bond yields lower.\n\nThe Fed increased access to dollars for central banks in nine countries so contracts can be taken out in key commodities and other goods that are made in the U.S. currency.\n\nThe U.S. central bank said swaps, in which the Fed accepts other currencies as collateral in exchange for dollars, will be in place for at least the next six months.\n\nThe swaps will allow the central banks of Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and New Zealand to tap a combined total of up to $450 billion to help ensure the world's dollar-dependent financial system functions.\n\nThe collateral to purchase crude oil, for example, is U.S. Treasury debt and to buy those securities requires dollars, said Michael Skordeles, U.S. macro strategist at Truist/Suntrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.\n\n\"All these things kind of happening at once causes a lot of dominoes to fall, and as the dominoes fall, it creates more demand, pushing people toward the dollar,\" Skordeles said.\n\n\"This (the dollar swap lines) is going to help, but it's not a silver bullet,\" he said. \"Because there's a flow of capital into dollar-denominated assets, in particular U.S. Treasuries, it's starving these countries of liquidity and making the dollar appreciate.\"\n\nU.S. oil prices surged about 25%, recouping some losses from a sell-off that drove prices to near 20-year lows over the past month, but analysts saw the rebound as a brief reprieve from the economic tsunami the virus is expected to cause.\n\nStocks responded, rebounding from initial declines, as investors held out hope the latest policymaker efforts will stop the freefall in equity markets and reduce the selling of bonds. But stocks on Wall Street pared some gains at the close.\n\nThe aggressive moves by both central banks and governments have been met with a muted market response and have failed to boost overall sentiment, said Candice Bangsund, a global asset allocation strategist at Fiera Capital in Montreal.\n\n\"Investors remain intensely focused on the progression of the fast-spreading pandemic and its implications for the global economy,\" she said.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.22% and emerging market stocks lost 2.41%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 188.27 points, or 0.95%, to 20,087.19. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 11.29 points, or 0.47%, to 2,409.39 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 160.73 points, or 2.3%, to 7,150.58.\n\nThe meltdown in markets had pushed Wall Street's three main indexes down about 30% as of Wednesday from their record closing highs last month.\n\n(Graphic: Equities and bonds total return, here)\n\nGlobal bond prices gyrated, with desperate investors dumping government bonds and hoarding cash in markets gripped by pandemic fears that have forced central banks to step up support for debt.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields largely fell in volatile trading, a sign the Fed's efforts were working.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 28/32 in price to yield 1.1667%.\n\nThe dollar rallied further as investors rushed to secure liquidity. The British pound GBP=D3 was down in choppy trade and slipped past the previous day's trough to the lowest since at least 1985.\n\nBond markets stabilized somewhat after the European Central Bank pledged late Wednesday to buy 750 billion euros ($820 billion) in sovereign debt through 2020. That brought the ECB's planned purchases for this year to 1.1 trillion euros.\n\nThe dollar index =USD rose 1.846% and the Japanese yen JPY= weakened 2.26% versus the greenback at 110.58 per dollar.\n\nGovernment bond yields in Italy and across the euro zone dropped after the ECB's emergency measures, though European stocks fell back into negative territory after arresting their rout in early trading.\n\nExpected price swings for some of the world's biggest currencies rocketed to multiyear highs as the demand for dollars forced traders to dump currencies across the board.\n\nFor the British pound versus the dollar, expected volatility gauges leapt to 24.4%, their highest level since before the 2016 Brexit vote.\n\n\"One unresolved and really critical issue is what's going on in volatility,\" said Andrew Sheets, chief cross-asset strategist at Morgan Stanley. \"I think that volatility needs to stabilise before the broader market can heal.\"\n\nItaly, which has seen its borrowing costs jump in recent days, led the drop in yields after the ECB move.\n\nThe gap over the safer German Bund's yields tightened.\n\nThe U.S. Fed earlier promised a liquidity facility for money market mutual funds, and Australia's central bank slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.25%.\n\nTraders reported huge strains in bond markets, however, as distressed funds sold any liquid asset to cover equity losses and investor redemptions.\n\nBenchmark 10-year sovereign bond yields in New Zealand, Malaysia, Korea, Singapore and Thailand surged as prices fell, and U.S. 10-year Treasuries US10YT=RR rose 10 basis points through the session.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 9,700 people globally, infected more than 236,000 and prompted widespread emergency lockdowns.\n\nGold XAU= fell and, like other assets, was buffeted by volatility. Copper, a gauge of global economic health, hit its down-limit in Shanghai, and London futures traded in London CMCU3 fell to their lowest since 2016.[MET/L]", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

a news conference the government was trying to secure more ventilators to prepare for the expected spike in cases over this week and next week.\n\nThe gathering of Islamic missionaries and followers was attended by 16,000 people, 14,500 of them residents of Malaysia, including hundreds of Rohingya and other refugees.\n\nThe Health Ministry said it was working closely with the U.N. refugee agency to ensure refugees and asylum-seekers were included in preventive and containment activities to contain any potential communal spread.\n\nTo trace those from this group that had participated in the

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will only receive vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, its latest move to free up inventory space for medical and household goods in high demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe change does not mean that Amazon will stop selling non-essential items like phone cases and toys for now, only that products may be more likely to run out of stock in the next few weeks or sellers have to ship the products directly to consumers themselves.\n\nIn a note sent to sellers on Tuesday, Amazon said it is seeing increasing online shopping demand from consumers. As its household staples and medical supplies are running out of stock, it will prioritize certain categories in order to \"quickly receive, restock, and ship these products to customers.\"\n\nAmazon defined several categories as essential products that can continue shipping, including baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; grocery; industrial and scientific; and pet supplies. Books are included as well.\n\n\"We understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,\" Amazon said in a statement.\n\nThe company said the new protocol applies to both first-party vendors and third-party sellers. That suggests that the company is not protecting its own products.\n\nThe move follows Amazon's announcement it will hire 100,000 workers for its warehouses on Monday, as the Seattle-based giant is trying to meet growing online shopping need from people who stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe months-long outbreak is posing challenges to the e-commerce giant's operations, from supply chain to deliveries, as the virus spreads from China to the rest of the world.\n\n\"Our factories just resumed production, but now we can't ship to warehouses until April,\" said Zengxie Pang, a China-based seller, \"We are already seeing a rising demand for kitchen supplies and they will likely run out of stock, as well as other products people use when they're stuck at home.\"\n\nAmazon's two-day shipping guarantee has also in some cases slowed to up to seven-day delivery, Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note. Tuesday's announcement aims to speed up the operation, at the risk of limiting the availability of non-essential items like electronics that typically are a big part of Amazon's business.\n\n\"This change will likely force some third-party sellers currently dependent on Amazon to shift sales to other marketplaces (eBay, Wish, Walmart, Facebook Marketplace, etc.), or onto their own websites,\" Sebastian said.\n\nThird-party sellers account for over half of the sales on Amazon. Amazon has been courting sellers to use its own fulfillment system, enabling many of them with faster delivery without the risks of sitting on inventories.\n\nIt is especially popular for sellers who use a drop shipping method, meaning sellers import products from manufacturers in countries including China and directly send them to an Amazon warehouse. Amazon earns fees from managing the storage and delivery process.\n\nSellers supplying products that are deemed non-essential could see their products run out of stock and they will be unable to restock as a result of the measure. Still, they can use other fulfillment methods to directly mail products to customers.\n\nOne consultant said the announcement landed as third-party sellers were grappling with economic uncertainty amid the outbreak. Workers at bars, gyms, theaters and other non-essential businesses are furloughed to help contain the spread of the deadly virus and President Donald Trump on Monday said the U.S. economy may be sliding into recession.\n\n\"Sellers are rethinking their entire strategies for selling in 2020, not just Q1 and Prime Day,\" said Chris McCabe, founder of Amazon seller consultancy ecommerceChris.com.\n\nPrime Day, scheduled for July every year, is Amazon's annual marketing blitz when sellers offer exclusive deals and discounts that contribute more sales than Black Friday. Sellers usually stock up on inventory ahead of the shopping holiday, while this decision adds uncertainty to when they could ship products in.\n\n\"Just posting this announcement has a big impact on Prime Day,\" McCabe said.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Products and Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Beauty", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Beauty", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online_Grocery_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online Grocery Stores", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Canopying", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Canopying", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200317&t=2&i=1504462342&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2G1LC", "eventUri": null, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 13266}, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 13266, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1485056341", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-16", "time": "04:19:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-16T04:19:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-16T04:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9450980424880981, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-idUSKBN2130EQ", "title": "Coronavirus causes historic market drop, global scramble to contain...", "body": "(Reuters) - Coronavirus fears led to a historic drop in U.S. stocks, shut borders and disrupted daily life around the world, as governments took increasingly drastic measures to try to reduce the severity of the global outbreak.\n\nFinancial markets had their worst day in 30 years despite emergency action by global central banks to try to prevent a recession, with U.S. stock markets falling 12% to 13%, wiping out trillions of dollars in market value.\n\nJust a month ago, financial markets were hitting record highs on the assumption the outbreak would largely be contained in China and not cause disruptions beyond what was seen with earlier viral outbreaks of Ebola, SARS and MERS. There have now been more cases and more deaths outside mainland China than inside, with 180,000 cases worldwide and over 7,000 deaths. Tracking the spread here\n\nCanada, Chile and other countries closed their borders to visitors. Peru deployed masked military personnel to block major roads, while Ireland launched a campaign to recruit more healthcare workers. Airlines slashed flights, shed jobs and asked governments for billions of dollars in loans and grants.\n\nIn contrast to much of the world, Mexico and Brazil still held large political rallies and the United Kingdom kept its schools open.\n\nGRAPHIC: Track the spread of coronavirus - here\n\nU.S. states pleaded with the Trump administration on Monday to coordinate a national response to the outbreak, saying patchwork measures enacted by state and local authorities were insufficient to confront the coast-to-coast emergency that has killed at least 74 Americans.\n\nA few hours later, President Donald Trump urged Americans to halt most social activities for 15 days and not congregate in groups larger than 10 people in a newly aggressive effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nCalling the highly contagious virus an \"invisible enemy,\" Trump said the worst of the outbreak could be over by July, August or later and warned a recession was possible.\n\nHowever, the United States was not yet closing its borders or mandating curfews or business closures on a national scale.\n\nMany states and cities had already taken those steps or were preparing to. San Francisco area residents will be urged to shelter in place for three weeks starting on Tuesday, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\nA White House adviser said the United States could pump $800 billion or more into the economy to minimize economic damage.\n\nEU finance ministers were planning a coordinated economic response to the virus, which the European Commission says could push the European Union into recession.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) called on all countries on Monday to ramp up testing programs as the best way to slow the advance of the pandemic.\n\n\"We have a simple message to all countries - test, test, test,\" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva. \"All countries should be able to test all suspected cases. They cannot fight this pandemic blindfolded.\"\n\nIn Italy, another 349 people died on Monday, taking the total to 2,158, with nearly 28,000 cases, after 368 deaths were reported on Sunday, a daily toll more dire than even China was reporting at the peak of the outbreak.\n\n\"Many children think it is scary,\" Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference dedicated to answering children's questions about the pandemic.\n\n\"It is OK to be scared when so many things happen at the same time,\" Solberg said.\n\nSeveral countries banned mass gatherings such as sports, cultural and religious events to combat the fast-spreading respiratory disease that has infected nearly 179,000 people globally and killed more than 7,000.\n\nSpain and France, where cases and fatalities have begun surging at a pace just days behind that of Italy, imposed severe lockdowns over the weekend.\n\nThe Middle East business and travel hub of Dubai said it was closing all bars and lounges until the end of March. Thailand plans to close schools, bars, movie theaters and popular cockfighting arenas.\n\nPublic health experts in the United States and elsewhere are hoping the measures will help spread out the number of new cases over time so as not to overwhelm hospitals and healthcare systems as has happened in Italy.\n\nItaly's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told daily Corriere della Sera that the outbreak was still getting worse, though the governor of Lombardy, the northern region that has suffered the worst, said he saw the first signs of a slowdown.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee

tourist hotspot Rio de Janeiro, as Latin America's largest nation closed more borders to visitors and the foreign minister waded into a diplomatic spat with China.\n\nThe Rio state government said the two deaths were a 63-year-old diabetic woman in the hilly interior of Rio de Janeiro state and a 69-year-old man, also diabetic, in the city of Niteroi.\n\nThe state of Sao Paulo later reported the death of a 77-year old man, bringing the country's toll to seven. Earlier, the Health Ministry said the number of confirmed cases had risen to 621, an increase of 193 from Wednesday.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro, who has faced criticism for his lax handling of an outbreak he initially called a \"fantasy,\" issued a decree restricting entry of foreign visitors at land borders with Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana. On Wednesday, Brazil began turning away Venezuelans at the border.\n\nAs Bolsonaro closed borders, his foreign minister Ernesto Araujo appeared to fan the flames of a diplomatic spat with China started on Wednesday by the president's son Eduardo who blamed the spread of the virus on a failed cover-up of the initial outbreak by the Asian giant.\n\nThe Chinese Ambassador Yang Wanming demanded an apology but also retweeted a post describing the Bolsonaro family as a \"huge poison,\" a retweet he has since erased.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that the Chinese ambassador endorses or shares offensive posts aimed at the Brazilian head of state,\" Araujo said in a statement, adding he expected a retraction.\n\nAraujo also said Eduardo's comments did not reflect the government's position.

wholly focused on COVID-19 and on how Amazon can best play its role,\" according to a message posted on a company website.\n\nHourly workers at Amazon's U.S. warehouses will receive double pay after 40 hours for overtime, up from the 1.5-times rate, from March 15 through May 9, the rate increase announcement said.\n\nThis is the second time the e-commerce giant announced an increase in pay for its workers in a week. On Monday, Amazon hiked the minimum hourly rate for associates to $17 from $15 and announced plans to hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States as the virus outbreak boosts online orders.\n\nAs the virus spreads across the U.S., Amazon has offered unlimited unpaid time off to encourage employees to stay home if they do not feel well. It has also staggered workers shifts and prohibited employees from sitting next to each other in the lunchroom to limit contact.\n\nBut four Democratic U.S. senators, including Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders on Friday expressed concern in a letter to Bezos that Amazon has not taken enough measures to protect its warehouse staff. They specifically asked if the company would provide \"time-and-a-half\" hazard pay for its workers.\n\nIn response to Saturday's wage news, one of the letter's signatories, Senator Robert Menendez said he applauded the decision but that Amazon still had work to do to protect employees.\n\nBezos said in Saturday's online post that Amazon has ordered \"millions\" of face masks for its on-site staff, but few have been filled because the masks are in low supply and are first going to hospitals at governments' directions.\n\n\"When our turn for masks comes, our first priority will be getting them in the hands of our employees and partners working to get essential products to people,\" he said.\n\nAmazon on Thursday reported its first warehouse employee in the United States tested positive for the virus, forcing the company to temporarily shutter the facility in New York.\n\nAs the virus spreads across the United States, several clothing retailers and department-store chains have shut stores, and cafe and restaurant operators have closed down or limited services to delivery and take-away.\n\nOnline retailers and grocery stores are trying to capture rising demand as more Americans are ordered to stay at home to reduce the spread of the outbreak.\n\nRival retailer Walmart Inc said on Thursday it plans to hire 150,000 hourly associates in the U.S. and announced $550 million in cash bonuses to reward workers.\n\nThe highly contagious coronavirus has infected more than 274,800 people across the world and led to more than 11,300 deaths globally, forcing governments across the world to issue mass lockdowns of people in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work and Family", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200321&t=2&i=1506318964&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2K0GM", "eventUri": "eng-5619696", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 11909}, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 11909, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1484891215", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-16", "time": "00:03:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-16T00:03:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-16T00:01:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8196078538894653, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-idUSKBN2121FT", "title": "Oil slumps below $30 a barrel as coronavirus spreads, OPEC rancor...", "body": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell below $30 a barrel on Monday after the worldwide coronavirus outbreak worsened over the weekend, exacerbating fears that government lockdowns to contain the spread of the disease would spark a global recession.\n\nSaudi Aramco reiterated plans to boost output to record levels to boost its share of the global market. Top global oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia started a price war after failing to agree on a plan to curb supply as the global economic slowdown destroys oil demand.\n\nThe coming flood of supply from Saudi Arabia and other producers could result in the largest surplus of crude in history, said global information provider IHS Markit.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 settled down $3.80, or 11.2%, at $30.05 a barrel. The international benchmark fell as low as $29.52 a barrel, its lowest since January 2016.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 fell $3.03, or 9.6%, to end at $28.70 a barrel, its lowest since February 2016.\n\nSaudi Aramco is likely to sustain higher oil output in May, Chief Executive Amin Nasser said, signaling the top oil-producing company is prepared to live with low prices for a while.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak, which has infected at least 174,000 people and killed around 6,700, already has caused oil prices to plummet by 50% this year. Many forecasters have lowered estimates on crude demand, as the virus disrupts business activity, travel and daily life.\n\nWith Saudi Arabia and Russia pledging to boost production, IHS Markit estimates that oversupply of oil could come to 800 million to 1.3 billion barrels -- double or triple what existed in late 2015 to early 2016, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped more oil to combat the growing U.S. shale industry.\n\n\"The last time that there was a global surplus of this magnitude was never. Prior to this, the largest six-month global surplus this century was 360 million barrels. What is coming will be twice that or more,\" said Jim Burkhard, vice president and head of oil markets at IHS Markit.\n\nAn OPEC and non-OPEC technical meeting planned for Wednesday in Vienna has been called off as attempts to mediate between Saudi Arabia and Russia made no progress, sources said.\n\nCentral banks globally took action over the weekend to try to quell economic fallout of the pandemic, but the measures did little to strengthen stock markets in freefall, as investors anticipate a sharp contraction in demand in coming weeks anyway.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve on Sunday slashed its key rate to near zero, triggering an unscheduled rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to a record low as markets in Asia opened for trading this week.\n\nThe Bank of Japan later stepped in by easing monetary policy further, while Gulf central banks also cut interest rates.\n\nIn China, where the virus began, daily refinery throughputs dropped 4.8% in the first two months of the year, sliding to the lowest level since December 2018, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday.\n\nBrent's premium to WTI CL-LCO1=R narrowed to less than $1 during Monday's session, falling to its lowest since 2016, making U.S. crude oil uncompetitive in international markets.\n\nGraphic - Brent's premium to WTI: here\n\nNumerous U.S. oil companies have swiftly cut spending, with analysts anticipating consolidation or restructurings. U.S. crude output has grown in recent years to nearly 13 million bpd, making it the world's largest producer.\n\n\"Some of them (U.S. shale oil companies) may not survive prolonged low oil prices, and in this event U.S. production would decrease. Less crude availability in the U.S. is likely to reduce the WTI discount to Brent,\" Societe Generale analysts in a note to clients.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday Washington would take advantage of low oil prices and fill the U.S. emergency crude oil reserve. The move is aimed to help energy producers struggling from the price plunge.\n\nThe United States could begin purchasing domestically produced crude oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as soon as two weeks from now, and fill it in several months, an Energy Department source said on Monday. However, the purchases are not seen as likely to offset the drop in demand nor the increase in supply, Energy Aspects said in a note.\n\n\"The impact on weekly crude supply shifts could be as much as 4-5 million barrels starting in a couple of weeks,\" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a report. \"However, we will note that such supply represents a drop in the bucket in relation to the amount of oil consumed globally on a daily basis.\"\n\nU.S. oil output growth from the Permian basin is expected to offset declines in every other shale formation in April, helping push overall production up by about 18,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 9.08 million bpd, data showed.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil reserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMC_Markets", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CMC Markets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200315&t=2&i=1503720656&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2E12K", "eventUri": "eng-5602823", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "shares": {"facebook": 11774}, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 11774, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1486547645", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-17", "time": "06:37:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-17T06:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-17T06:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tesla-factory-idUSKBN2140Q8", "title": "Tesla plant can't run normally in coronavirus shutdown: California...", "body": "NEW YORK/BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) cannot continue to operate its main U.S. vehicle plant normally as its San Francisco Bay Area home began a three-week lockdown on Tuesday to slow the spread of coronavirus, a county sheriff's office spokesman said.\n\nThe comment relates to Tesla's factory in Fremont, Alameda County, which employs more than 10,000 workers and recorded annualized production of about 415,000 electric vehicles as at the end of December.\n\nThe order comes as Tesla ramps up production of its Model Y sport-utility vehicle at the factory. Billionaire Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the model will see higher demand than all of Tesla's other models combined.\n\nAlameda is one of at least nine counties covered by a 'shelter in place' order that limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential, and advises people to stay home except for the most crucial reasons.\n\nIt is aimed at helping stem a pandemic which has affected nearly 200,000 people worldwide and killed more than 100 in the United States including 12 in California.\n\nThe order will be an additional headache for Tesla, which was forced to shut down its $2 billion Shanghai factory for 10 days on top of the traditional week-long Lunar New Year holiday this year due to the rapidly spreading coronavirus.\n\n\"Tesla is not an essential business as defined in the Alameda County Health Order. Tesla can maintain minimum basic operations per the Alameda County Health Order,\" the spokesman said.\n\nUnder the order announced Monday afternoon, businesses deemed non-essential can only maintain minimum basic operations, such as maintaining the value of inventory, ensuring security and processing payroll and employee benefits. Violations or failure to comply is punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.\n\nThe spokesman said his office had not spoken to Tesla since implementing the order, which takes effect from Tuesday.\n\nTesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Its share price fell 5.1% in after-hours trade on Tuesday.\n\nThe order is the latest to hit the global auto industry, which has taken a major hit from the outbreak.\n\nThe Big Three Detroit automakers - General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) - and the United Auto Workers union agreed Tuesday to curtail production at U.S. factories and limit the number of workers on the job at one time.\n\nPrior to the county's order, Tesla had told employees in an email that the automaker and its suppliers would continue operations supporting manufacturing and vehicle delivery, a person who had seen the email told Reuters.\n\nIn another memo on Monday, Musk told employees he was not aware of any workers who had tested positive for the virus, and urged them to stay home if they felt the \"slightest bit ill or even uncomfortable\", people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nCalifornia's Department of Public Health in a statement said it would issue shutdown guidelines for manufacturing facilities in the days ahead.\n\nBay Area counties had reported 273 coronavirus infections by Monday. California has reported 12 deaths from the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the virus.", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrek", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fremont, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fremont, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alameda County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alameda County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter_in_place", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shelter in place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Construction_and_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Construction and Planning", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200317&t=2&i=1504303392&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG2G0IM", "eventUri": "eng-5602736", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "shares": {"facebook": 11537}, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 11537, "relevance": 52}], "totalResults": 2907, "page": 1, "count": 25, "pages": 117}}
