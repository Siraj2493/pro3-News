", "body": "People over age 50 are more susceptible to respiratory illnesses, and related complications\n\nThe U.S. has 12 reported cases of coronavirus across the country -- and at least half of them are of people age 50 and older.\n\nSix states -- Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin -- have patients with confirmed cases of coronavirus, though people are under investigation in a total of 36 states and U.S. territories, according to the . Of the with coronavirus in California, four are in their 50s, and both Illinois patients are in their 60s. The -- reported by the Wisconsin Department of Health Service -- did not specify the patient's age.\n\nA total of 237 people have been tested for coronavirus in the U.S. as of Friday, and 100 more investigations are pending, the CDC reported. Of the 210 people who were tested for the virus in the U.S. in January, 46 were between 50 and 64 years old (or 22%) and another four who were older than 65 (2%), according to a new CDC about coronavirus evaluations.\n\n\"This does appear to affect seniors worse than people as a whole,\" said William Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But there isn't enough data on the spectrum of severity, he said. \"We tend to see more severe cases and not less severe cases. Hopefully that will become clearer in the next few weeks,\" he said.\n\nSee:\n\nThe virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, late last year, has affected 25 countries so far. There are more than 31,000 cases and 638 deaths around the world, the World Health Organization . No patients in the U.S. have died, but many of those who have died in other countries were elderly. Preliminary data from China's National Health Commission show patients who died from coronavirus were in their 60s, 70s and 80s, and exhibited fever, coughing and shortness of breath, Bloomberg earlier this year.\n\nThe coronavirus also comes at a time when many people are sniffling, coughing and coming down with a fever. The winter is known as cold and flu season, and older Americans are at a higher risk of developing these illnesses. \"Respiratory viruses are more severe in older individuals,\" said Mark Mulligan, director of NYU Langone Health's division of infectious diseases and immunology. \"As we age, our immune system ages and it is not as effective.\"\n\nIf an older individual -- or anyone, really -- starts feeling sick, they shouldn't focus on it potentially being the coronavirus, but instead get to a doctor. \"It can be another respiratory virus,\" said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The symptoms of coronavirus and influenza are similar, and the flu can be just as dangerous for someone older.\n\nOf the approximately 34,000 estimated flu-related deaths in the 2018-2019 season, more than 25,500 of them were of people 65 and older, according to . Of the more than 490,000 flu-related hospitalizations, nearly 280,000 were estimated to be for patients of the same age group.\n\nOlder individuals may also suffer from complications arising from the flu, such as pneumonia or worsening chronic illnesses, like asthma or heart disease, the .\n\nAlso see:\n\nMany Americans are rushing to buy surgical face masks to prevent coronavirus, but Adalja said that's . Often times, people wear them improperly, and a sharp incline in consumer demand for the masks could mean a shortage for people who need them -- mainly, health care providers.\n\nFace masks may stop people from touching their face, or raise awareness, but there isn't enough research to support how helpful these masks are for preventing diseases, Hanage said. They can help from the wearer spreading the disease, though.\n\nInstead, those looking to be proactive should practice hand hygiene. Hand sanitizer is beneficial, but so is \"good old fashioned soap and water,\" Hanage said. The flu shot may not prevent coronavirus, but it can save someone from coming down with influenza, and help doctors diagnose patients, he added. Individuals should also avoid going to work when they're sick, practice social isolation until at least 24 hours have passed after having a fever and cover their mouth with their arm or a handkerchief when they cough, Mulligan said.\n\nAnother crucial thing to keep in mind: \"This is not a time for panic in the U.S.,\" Mulligan said. \"This is a time for awareness and continuing to listen to the situation.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alessandra_malito@marketwatch.com", "name": "Alessandra Malito", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Health Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_T.H._Chan_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard T.H.

The figures are seasonally adjusted.\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 215,000 reading.\n\nThe more stable monthly average of jobless claims, which filters out the weekly ups and downs, dropped by 3,000 to 211,750.\n\nNew unemployment applications are seen as a rough measure of how many people are losing their jobs. They touched a 50-year low of 193,000 in April 2019 and have hovered in the low 200,000s since then.\n\nWhat happened: Raw or unadjusted jobless claims rose the most in Pennsylvania and New York, and recorded the biggest declines in California, Michigan and New Jersey.

The economy likely created 164,000 new jobs in the first month of 2020, economists forecast. The January jobs report comes out Friday morning.\n\nWhat they are saying: \"Firms continue to report that their biggest problem as it relates to labor is a lack of available workers to fill open positions,\" said chief economist Stephen Stanley of Amherst Pierpont Securities.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.12% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.24% rose for a fourth straight day on Thursday.

director said Thursday\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people in the U.S. shouldn't wear face masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus, but that's not the only reason Americans may want to think twice about using them, one expert told MarketWatch.\n\nMost people don't know how to use face masks correctly, and a rush to buy masks could prevent the people who need them most -- health care providers -- from getting them, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a scholar at the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nThe CDC said last week it doesn't recommend people use face masks, making the announcement on the same day that was reported in the U.S. There were .\n\n\"The virus is not spreading in the general community,\" Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Jan. 30 briefing. \"We don't routinely recommend the use of face masks by the public to prevent respiratory illness. And we certainly are not recommending that at this time for this new virus.\"\n\nSee also:\n\nAmericans don't seem to be heeding the CDC's advice: Walgreens WBA, +1.49% and Duane Reade pharmacies have seen increased demand for face masks and hand sanitizer across the country, said Alexandra Brown, a spokeswoman for Walgreens, which owns both chains. \"We continually and closely monitor these types of situations to ensure that we have sufficient supply of those products,\" she said.\n\nCVS CVS, +1.36% has also seen a surge in sales of face masks. The demand \"may cause shortages at some store locations and we'll re-supply those stores as quickly as possible,\" said Stephanie Cunha, a CVS spokeswoman.\n\nAdalja applauded the CDC's recommendation on face masks. \"Even during H1N1 [flu epidemic], there was no recommendation to wear face masks,\" he said. They \"end up creating a false sense of security and most people don't wear them appropriately,\" he added.\n\nPeople not in the medical field who wear the masks often come in contact with germs when they lift the mask up to eat or slip their fingers under the mask to blow their nose, he said.\n\nPanic-driven demand for face masks, Adalja said, is particularly worrisome because it could have \"a negative supply shock\" effect on hospital personnel who need these masks more than the general public.\n\n\"The best ways [for the general public] to protect themselves are the basic hygienic measures,\" he said. That includes washing your hands regularly and covering sneezes and coughs. But if you are \"sick and need to go out you should wear a mask.\"\n\nInstead of wearing face masks, Messonnier said that the general public should \"be vigilant to the symptoms and signs of this novel coronavirus, that is, a fever and cough, and if you have those symptoms, please call your health-care provider.\"\n\nMoving forward, the CDC expects to see more cases of person-to-person spread of coronavirus, Messonnier said. \"We want our actions to be evidence-based and appropriate to the current circumstance,\" which she said did not justify the use of face masks for people who have not been directly exposed to the virus.\n\nThere are still many unknowns about how this strain of coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, spreads, but when person-to-person spread has occurred in the past, \"it is thought to have happened via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread,\" the .\n\nFace masks are often worn to protect against these germs, and in China, two provinces require them to be worn in public. Factories in the country are working 24 hours a day to meet the demand, .\n\nLast week Alibaba-owned BABA, +5.11%, retailer Taobao upward of 80 million face masks a day. The company has urged sellers not to hike the price of the masks being sold despite rampant demand.\n\nIn a recent coronavirus , the World Health Organization gave instructions for how to appropriately wear and dispose of face masks. WHO also noted, \"However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted.\"\n\nWHO advises people who wish to wear a mask to place the mask \"carefully to cover mouth and nose and tie securely to minimise any gaps between the face and the mask,\" avoid touching the mask while you're wearing it, and dispose of masks as soon as they become damp or humid. When removing the face mask, WHO recommends that people \"do not touch the front but remove the lace from behind.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday, in China, according to health officials in China.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether they still advise the general public to refrain from wearing face masks.\n\nThis story was originally published on Jan. 30 and has been

Medium-sized businesses added 128,000 and large companies added 69,000\n\nThere were broad gains across sectors. According to data on 10 major industries tracked by ADP, leisure and hospitality had the biggest gain in January.

An institute statement acknowledged there are \"intellectual property barriers\" but said it acted to \"protect national interests.\"\n\nGranting its own scientists a patent might give the Chinese government leverage in negotiations over paying for the drug. But it also might fuel complaints Beijing abuses its regulatory system to pressure foreign companies to hand over valuable technology.\n\nOn Thursday, the official Xinhua News Agency said clinical trials of the drug, remdesivir, were due to start.\n\nGilead , headquartered in Foster City, California, said it applied in 2016 for a Chinese patent on use of remdesivir against coronaviruses and is waiting for a decision. The coronavirus family includes the novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, blamed for the outbreak in Wuhan.\n\n\"Gilead has no influence over whether a patent office issues a patent to the Chinese researchers,\" said a company spokesman, Ryan McKeel. \"Their application has been filed more than three years after Gilead's filing and will be considered in view of what is already known about the compound and pending patent applications.\"\n\nThe institute said its application was filed Jan. 21. Two days later, Chinese authorities suspended most access to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to surrounding cities and some in other provinces, isolating a total of about 60 million people in the most sweeping anti-disease measures ever imposed.\n\nChina has the right under World Trade Organization rules to declare an emergency and compel a company to license a patent to protect the public. It would be required to pay a license fee that is deemed fair market value.\n\nThe government might be able to avoid that fee if the patent were granted to the Wuhan institute, part of the elite Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe institute said it applied for a \"use patent\" that specifies the Wuhan virus as the drug's target. Gilead's patent application, filed before the virus was identified, cites only the overall family of coronaviruses.\n\nThe Chinese researchers made their patent application \"from the perspective of protecting national interests,\" said the institute statement.\n\n\"If relevant foreign companies plan to contribute to China's epidemic prevention and control, we both agree that if the state needs it, we will not require enforcement of rights given by the patent,\" it said.\n\nGillead said last week it was working with U.S. and Chinese health authorities on studying remdesivir. The company said it has provided the drug for emergency use in a small number of patients with the Wuhan virus \"in the absence of any approved treatment options.\"\n\n___\n\nJohson reported from

'self-quarantine' to prevent coronavirus spread, state health officials say", "body": "Coronavirus is forcing colleges with high enrollment from China into delicate balancing act\n\nWith 11 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. and 260 under investigation universities are ramping up efforts to protect students, faculty and staff from the potentially deadly illness -- especially schools that have large populations of students from China.\n\nAlso see:\n\nAt Princeton University, where there were 623 students from China last academic year, the school is following by the New Jersey Department of Health that students and faculty at K-12 schools and colleges who have recently returned from China \"self-quarantine\" for two weeks if they're at moderate or high risk of potentially contracting the illness.\n\nSchool officials asked about 100 students to get assessed for their risk level at the school's health center following NJDOH guidance, said Michael Hotchkiss, a university spokesman. \"Everyone the university has assessed so far is low risk,\" meaning there is no need for them to self-quarantine, Hotchkiss said. \"We are in the process of assessing the final students -- fewer than five -- and expect to be able to clear more today,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\nBefore classes began this week, the university instructed anyone who had visited China within the past two weeks to \"complete so that the University can provide you with assistance.\" The university said on the site that \"food service will be provided to those students who have chosen to self-isolate and have completed this form.\"\n\nMore international students come to the U.S. from China than from any other country\n\nThat's just one example of the actions universities are taking in response to coronavirus at a time when more international students come to the U.S. from China than from any other country. In the 2018-2019 academic year, there were more than 369,000 students from China studying at U.S. colleges, according to the Institute of International Education.\n\nWith large groups of people sharing living spaces, classrooms, libraries and dining halls, colleges face unique challenges in managing contagious illnesses. \"Universities are often the most global and we are often on the front lines of these situations,\" said Dr. Sarah Van Orman, the associate vice provost for student health at the University of Southern California. The school has 6,626 students from China, the second-largest population of students from China in the U.S., according to the IIE.\n\nCalifornia, where two coronavirus cases were confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is the state with the biggest share of students from China at its colleges and universities. Some 42.1% of international students studying there, or 161,693 students, are from China, IIE data shows.\n\nUSC started monitoring students who visit the university health center for symptoms of coronavirus more than three weeks ago, Van Orman said. The university, she added, \"does not make decisions alone\" when it comes to isolation, quarantine or activating one of its . \"We are making the decisions with the local authorities and they have jurisdiction over the event.\"\n\nThe university health center, she said, has experienced a spike in visits recently. Most of the students who come in fearing they might have contracted coronavirus end up being diagnosed with the flu, which she said is quite common around this time of year.\n\nSchools are working to keep students informed\n\nAs students returned to campuses after winter break, schools that have large populations of students from China -- including New York University, Columbia University, the University of Michigan, and Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. -- sent out email alerts to their campus communities. Many provided information regarding the symptoms of coronavirus and precautions to take in the event that an individual experiences or comes into contact with these symptoms. The University of Illinois hosted a after a student presented at the school's health center with possible coronavirus symptoms but did not have the illness.\n\nUSC posted an update to its coronavirus advisory shortly after the news that an individual had contracted the virus in Los Angeles. The assured students that \"there is no known connection between the affected individuals and USC.\"\n\nUniversities are trying to help students with family in China\n\nThe university has a responsibility to make sure students or faculty who recently returned from Wuhan -- -- seek out proper care if they experience symptoms of coronavirus, Van Orman said. The school is supposed to report possible cases to local health authorities, she said.\n\nAt the same time, the school is working to support students from China with family who are still in Wuhan. \"Some students have family in Wuhan and are scared for their families and friends. It is having an impact on students' studying,\" Van Orman said. \"We think it is equally as important for us as a community to support them.\"\n\nVan Orman said she also worries that people on the USC campus could become overly concerned to the point where they could think, \"Oh, I don't want to sit with someone or go near someone\" who they fear could have come in contact with the virus. To help head off that possibility, the school is keeping students up to date on the latest information about the virus with email alerts, she said.\n\nThere's also the question of helping students continue their academic work. NYU, which currently has the highest number of international students in the country, has been in direct contact with students who were unable to return to campus from China because of travel bans, a spokesman said.\n\nThe university has \"been engaged in academic planning to help students who couldn't return to New York because of travel restrictions participate in class,\" John Beckman, the senior vice president for public affairs at NYU said.\n\nThe university provided these students with a \"'tool kit' of recommended technology-based options to allow the student to participate in the class,\" and has been in touch with deans of their schools to help faculty implement them, he said.\n\nNYU, has the start of its spring-semester classes at its Shanghai campus, which will be taught remotely using technology beginning Feb. 17. Like USC, the university has sent out several alerts about the virus and has created a where it regularly posts updates.\n\nIn line with guidance from the CDC and the World Health Organization, NYU has \"directly communicated with all the students from affected areas advising them about the symptoms of the illness, and [is] instructing them to go to the health center if they are demonstrating the symptoms,\" Becker said.\n\nPublic universities rely on international student enrollment\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak comes as some U.S. campuses have seen significant drops in the rate of students enrolling from China after a decade-long upward trend, creating financial worries for some schools, the Associated Press .\n\nAbout one-third of international students in the U.S. are from China, according to the AP.\n\nParticularly at public colleges, international enrollment has become a critical source of funding as state budgets tighten. Unlike most students from the U.S., these students must .\n\nHigher education leaders have that the Trump administration's foreign-policy stance has made the U.S. a less desirable destination for international students to study.\n\nThis, they say, helped contribute to a major drop in enrollment of students from China at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2018. To protect against the drop, that would help cover potential financial losses due to a dip in enrollment from China.\n\nRelated:\n\nWhile there have not been any confirmed cases of coronavirus in Michigan, Michigan State University, which has the 25th-highest number of international students in the U.S., has kept the university community updated about the virus.\n\nLike several universities that have programs in China, MSU \"has suspended university-sponsored travel to China for the next eight weeks,\" Dan Olsen, deputy spokesman of the university, said in a statement. \"We will continue to welcome and work with our students, visitors and scholars from China -- they are essential in the continued fueling of discoveries and scholarship and more importantly, the vibrancy of our Spartan community,\" he said.\n\nThere have not been any deaths reported in the U.S. from coronavirus. In China, at least 490 people have died from the illness and more than 24,000 people have been infected as of Wednesday.\n\nThis story was originally published on Jan. 29 and has been updated.",

"Ford reports $1.7 billion quarterly loss, shares tumble", "body": "Ford Motor Co. shares fell as much as 11% in the extended session Tuesday after the U.S. auto maker missed adjusted profit expectations and posted a GAAP loss for its fourth quarter.\n\nFord F, +2.23% said it lost $1.7 billion, or 42 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $100 million, or 3 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The GAAP loss included a previously disclosed $2.2 billion charge related to pensions.\n\nAdjusted for one-time items, Ford said it gained 12 cents a share, compared with 30 cents a share a year ago. Revenue fell 5% to $39.7 billion from $41.8 billion a year ago.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet had expected the auto maker to report adjusted earnings of 17 cents a share on sales of $39.6 billion. The analysts had seen a GAAP profit of 15 cents a share for the quarter.\n\n\"Financially, the company's 2019 performance was short of our original expectations, mostly because our operational execution -- which we usually do very well -- wasn't nearly good enough. We recognize, take accountability for and have made changes because of this,\" Chief Executive Jim Hackett said in a statement.\n\nHackett repeated the promise during a conference call with analysts following the results. \"We can't miss a beat in the product launches,\" he said. \"Now it's about executing.\"\n\nChief Financial Officer Tim Stone started his remarks saying Ford's 2019 results \"were not OK,\" but the company is confident it will improve its operations and earn back investors' trust.\n\nHackett said it was too early to estimate implications of the coronavirus outbreak in China on its bottom line this year.\n\nThe company said it expected adjusted earnings between $5.6 billion to $6.6 billion for full-year 2020, assuming \"nominal growth\" for its automotive business offset by lower contributions from its credit arm and a \"modestly higher\" investment in autonomous cars.\n\nDuring the call, Ford executives did not give firm numbers either, which prompted Rod Lache of Wolfe Research to say it was \"challenging\" for Wall Street to assess the company's situation and the headwinds it would face. Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley spoke next and said \"transparency really would be helpful.\"\n\nFor the first quarter, Ford said it expects adjusted earnings to be down more than $1.1 billion from the first quarter of 2019 thanks to higher warranty costs, an ongoing issue for the company, lower vehicle volumes plus the lower results from Ford Credit and the higher driverless-car investments.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Tesla Inc. TSLA, +13.73% surpassed Ford as , a metric that takes into consideration market capitalization as well as debt, cash and cash equivalents. Tesla\n\nGeneral Motors Co. GM, +1.93% is expected to report its quarterly numbers Wednesday before the bell, with analysts expecting GAAP and adjusted earnings of 1 cent a share on sales of $31.3 billion.\n\nFord shares have gained 6% in the past 12 months, lagging behind advances of 21% and 14% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.50% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.44% .", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "claudia_assis@marketwatch.com", "name": "Claudia Assis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hackett_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Hackett (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FactSet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FactSet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lache_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lache people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Credit_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Credit Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 9}], "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD908_f150_ZG_20190213150242.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 51}, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 51, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1437807025", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-06", "time": "15:36:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-06T15:36:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-06T15:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-update-565-deaths-more-than-28000-cases-worldwide-yum-china-reports-significant-interruption-2020-02-06", "title": "Coronavirus update: 565 deaths, more than 28,000 cases worldwide, Yum China reports 'significant interruption'", "body": "Boston Scientific tells investors it expects delays in procedures as Chinese hospital focus on treating coronavirus patients.\n\nThere are now 28,256 confirmed coronavirus cases in 25 countries and at least 565 deaths, according to the from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn China, there are 28,018 cases and at least 563 deaths, according to the most recent data from China's National Health Commission. And in the U.S., there are now 12 confirmed individuals with the virus, most recently including a case in Madison, Wis., that was announced by local health officials on Wednesday.\n\nRead:\n\nThe most deaths have taken place in China's Hubei Province, which is home to Wuhan, the city where the novel coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. Since then, a number of countries including the U.S. have implemented travel restrictions to stem the spread of the virus, which can cause pneumonia. WHO last week declared the outbreak an international public health emergency. At least 40 airlines have cut an estimated 25,000 flights to, from or within China, according to Cowen analysts.\n\nHealth officials release additional data about U.S. patients:\n\nLimited information is known about the individuals in the U.S. who have been diagnosed with the virus; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday shared additional data about the first 11 cases. Two patients are in their 60s, four in their 50s, one in their 40s, two in their 30s, and two in their 20s. Much of the preliminary data coming out of China has indicated that coronavirus patients are older, male, and tend to have underlying health conditions.\n\nAs has been reported previously, nine of the 11 diagnosed individuals had recently traveled to Wuhan. The remaining two individuals were infected in cases of person-to-person transmission between spouses. Eight of the 11 are men. One individual was identified during airport screening that was put into place on Jan. 17, the rest presented at clinical locations. Separately, health officials in Wisconsin said the patient there had traveled to Beijing and been in contact with people who had the virus who had been to Wuhan.\n\nResearchers weigh in on limited virus data:\n\nMuch of the published scientific data about the coronavirus has been inaccurate or has become so as more is understood about a virus that was first identified two months ago. The first case in the U.S. wasn't confirmed until Jan. 21.\n\nIn research published this week, infectious disease physicians wrote this coronavirus appears to have higher infection rates and lower fatality rates when compared with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), both of which are also coronaviruses, according to Drs. Carlos del Rio, professor of medicine at Atlanta's Emory University School of Medicine, and Preeti Malani, a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan. \"As testing becomes more frequent, the true number of cases and the full spectrum of disease will become more clear,\" they wrote in a Feb. 5 .\n\nDel Rio and Malani also wrote that it is likely that the virus was introduced to humans in one instance, by an unknown animal that was carrying a bat coronavirus. In the case of MERS, camels were the carriers of the bat coronavirus. In SARS, it was civet cats.\n\nAs the outbreak worsens, guidance for some companies is taking a hit:\n\n* The Nikkei Asian Review reported that an Apple AAPL, +0.89% plan to ramp up production of AirPods may be delayed as a result of manufacturing shutdowns related to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n* Sanofi SNY, +4.38% CEO Paul Hudson told investors that the company plans to announce a coronavirus-related initiative in the coming weeks.\n\nBoston Scientific Corp. BSX, +1.41%, which has a $600 million business in China, on Wednesday told investors to expect a \"negative H1 impact\" on expectations that Chinese patients will push back elective medical procedures during the outbreak. It also lowered its quarterly sales guidance for the first quarter of 2020. The device maker now anticipates a \"preliminary negative sales impact estimate of $10 million to $40 million.\"\n\n* Some health care companies are anticipating a slowdown in other health care services and therapies while the Chinese health care system remains focused on treating coronavirus patients. \"Chronic disease treatment has become priority number two right now,\" Maziar Mike Doustdar, head of international operations for insulin maker Novo Nordisk A/S NVO, +0.43%, told investors. Boston Scientific CFO Daniel Brennan said all procedures \"are at risk of being delayed.\"\n\n* Yum China Holdings Inc. YUMC, -1.63%, which operates fast-food brands like KFC and Pizza Hut, has closed 30% of its restaurants. For the restaurants that are still open, same-store sales have declined up to 50% since the Lunar New Year. The outbreak is causing \"significant interruption,\" Yum China Holdings Inc. CEO Joey Wat told investors. Operating losses for the quarter may be expected. Pizza Hut sales have struggled more than those of KFC, which has a stronger delivery business, as more Chinese customers are opting for takeout at home, the company said.\n\n* The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies EL, +4.06% said the third quarter will be most impacted by the taking place in China as a result of the outbreak. The beauty company updated its sales outlook for the second half of the year, saying it now predicts an increase up to 1%, compared with the same period a year ago.\n\n* Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, -1.21% widened and reduced the low end of its guidance over concerns about the projected impact on \"handset demand and supply chain.\"\n\nRead more of MarketWatch's coronavirus

private-sector jobs created in January, largest gain in 4 years", "body": "The numbers: Private-sector employment surged 291,000 in January, The gain was well above forecasts from economists surveyed by Econoday who expected a gain of 154,000. It was the largest increase since May 2015.\n\nWhat happened: Small businesses added 94,000 jobs in January, ADP said. Medium-sized businesses added 128,000 and large companies added 69,000\n\nThere were broad gains across sectors. According to data on 10 major industries tracked by ADP, leisure and hospitality had the biggest gain in January. Education also had a strong gain.\n\nOnly mining had a small decline.\n\nBig picture: Economists note there has been a big gap recently between ADP and government data, so the strong ADP reading might not lead to many upward estimates for job growth. According to a MarketWatch survey, economists expect 165,000 job gains in January and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.5%, a 50-year low.\n\nMost economists expects a slower pace of job growth as the year progresses.\n\nWhat ADP is saying: Warm weather \"juiced\" the ADP number, said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. \"Abstracting from the vagaries of the data, underlying job growth is close to 125,000 per month, which is consistent with low and stable unemployment,\" he added.\n\nWhat outside observers are saying: \"There may be some upside risk, but we continue to forecast a 160,000 rise in total payrolls, with private payrolls up 150,000,\" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics\n\nMarket reaction: Stocks SPX, +0.91% were gaining solidly in early Wednesday trading, rebounding from ground lost last week due to concerns about the coronavirus.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_robb@marketwatch.com", "name": "Greg Robb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adenosine diphosphate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zandi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zandi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody's_Analytics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moody's Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarketWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MarketWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Science/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Employment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Employment", "wgt": 12}], "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HX732_hiring_ZG_20200103115554.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 37}, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 37, "relevance": 2}, {"uri": "1439422661", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-07", "time": "20:18:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-07T20:18:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-07T20:18:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/modernas-stock-jumps-as-health-officials-say-virus-vaccine-development-has-no-glitches-2020-02-07", "title": "Moderna's stock jumps as health officials say virus vaccine development has 'no glitches'", "body": "Shares of Moderna Inc.

"body": "There's a limit to U.S. and China central-bank intervention, so investors ought to tread carefully\n\nIn a bid to support its stock market amid the coronavirus outbreak, China has cut reverse repo rates and injected massive liquidity. None of this helped the Chinese stock market from a rout. However, it has buoyed the stock market in the U.S.\n\nThere are expectations that China will inject even more money into the financial system. If that is not enough, there is speculation of more money printing by central banks across the world. There is even talk of an interest-rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nCan money printing reverse the economic damage from the coronavirus? Can money printing continue to take stocks to new highs? Let's explore with the help of two charts.\n\nRead:\n\nTwo charts\n\nPlease click for a chart showing the Federal Reserve's assets.\n\nPlease click for an annotated chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, +1.61%, which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.62%.\n\nFor the sake of transparency, both charts were previously published and nothing has been changed since publication.\n\nNote the following:\n\n* The first chart shows a dramatic rise in the Federal Reserve's assets since last year.\n\n* Since the Fed started printing more money, the U.S. stock market has risen in lockstep with the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n* The conclusion is unmistakable that the money the Fed is printing is going into stocks, especially in large-cap stocks such as Apple AAPL, +3.16%, Amazon AMZN, +1.42% and Microsoft MSFT, +3.23%.\n\n* The second chart shows the support zone in the stock market.\n\n* The second chart shows relative strength index (RSI) divergence. In plain English, this means that the internal momentum of the stock market was declining while prices were going up. Such a development often is a precursor to a decline in the stock market.\n\n* The second chart shows the Arora signal to raise cash and hedges to protect up to 63% of long-term portfolios given prior to the recent drop in the stock market.\n\n* The chart also shows a signal to short-sell Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, +2.04% for a short-term trade given prior to the recent drop in the stock market. For those who could not short, a signal was given to buy inverse ETF SQQQ, -6.17% ; this ETF goes up when the stock market goes down.\n\n* The most important point to note on the second chart is the support zone. In theory, the stock market should have fallen to the support zone on the news of the coronavirus. But the stock market has held up because of the general belief that central banks will print more money or engage in other ways to inject liquidity in the markets.\n\n* Semiconductors have been a leading indicator. These are early signs of a loss of momentum in popular semiconductor stocks such as AMD AMD, +2.60%, Micron Technology MU, +3.48% and Nvidia NVDA, +2.91%.\n\n* In our analysis at The Arora Report, China's use of energy may drop by about 20% in the short term. We took a short position in oil ETF USO, +1.19% before the drop. For those who could not short, a signal was given to buy inverse oil ETF DWT, -3.17%. The situation is negative for popular oil stocks such as Apache APA, +2.87%, Exxon XOM, +0.06% and Chevron CVX, +1.19%.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to .\n\nCoronavirus and SARS\n\nI am getting a large number of emails from investors who are comparing the coronavirus to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). SARS occurred in 2003 and did not have much of an impact on the stock market. Investors should note that there are significant differences between 2003 and now.\n\n* The coronavirus is occurring after a 10-year bull market. SARS occurred when the market was beginning to recover from the 2000 crash.\n\n* The coronavirus is occurring when the stock market is very overbought. This was not the case with SARS.\n\n* The Chinese economy was much smaller in 2003.\n\n* Travel has dramatically increased since 2003.\n\n* Over the past few years, China has been the engine of global growth.\n\n* Before the coronavirus, the Chinese economy was growing at the slowest rate in 29 years.\n\n* In our analysis, China's gross domestic product (GDP) will likely take at least a 1% hit.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nThe coronavirus is novel. Not enough is known about how the virus mutates, reproduces and spreads. It is simply prudent to be cautious and not rely on comparisons with SARS. In our analysis at The Arora Report, money printing has its limits. If the virus spreads, money printing may not be as effective as is generally believed by investors.\n\nCaution does not mean sell good long-term positions. We are providing precise levels of cash, hedges, which positions to trim and new opportunistic short-term trades.

"title": "U.S. trade deficit falls in 2019 for first time in six years as China tariffs reduce imports", "body": "Tariffs on China cut imports, but large deficits aren't going away\n\nThe numbers: The trade deficit fell slightly in 2019 to mark the first decline in six years, mostly reflecting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that reduced the flow of imports from the Asian giant.\n\nThe U.S. deficit slipped 1.7% to $617 billion last year from almost $628 billion in 2018. Last year's trade gap was the highest in a decade.\n\nEarlier in the year American wholesalers rushed to import goods from China before stiffer U.S. tariffs kicked in and they cut back in the fall after the Trump administration raised duties.\n\nAn interim trade deal signed by the U.S. and China that reduces some tariffs and seeks to ease tensions could lead to a rebound in Chinese imports in 2020. But the outbreak of the coronavirus adds another X-factor that could also severely disrupt global trade the world economy if it spreads, analysts say.\n\nThe annual trade deficit declined in 2019 even though the gap in December rose for the first time in four months. The deficit shot up 12% in December to $48.9 billion, .\n\nRead:\n\nWhat happened: Exports rose 0.8% to $210 billion in December. The U.S. exported more passenger planes and crude oil.\n\nIn 2019, the U.S. petroleum deficit shrank to $13.7 billion to mark the lowest level on record. The U.S. has become an energy superpower again and the world's biggest producer of oil and natural gas thanks to the fracking revolution.\n\nAuto exports fell, however.\n\nImports rose an even faster 2.7% to $258.5 billion in December, led by incoming shipments of crude oil, computer chips, cell phones and precious metals for industrial use. The U.S. still imports a lot of crude oil that it refines and ships to the U.S. and other parts of the world.\n\nImports of goods from China tumbled nearly 18% for the full year, slowing to $345.6 billion in 2019 from a record $419.5 billion in 2018.\n\nRising deficits with other nations, however, prevented the total U.S. deficit from falling very much last year. Companies merely shifted to other foreign sources such as Vietnam, Mexico and South America for goods that became too expensive to buy from China. Imports from Europe also rose.\n\nAs a result, the U.S. registered record trade deficits in goods with all those trading partners in 2019.\n\nRead:\n\nAlso:\n\nBig picture: The small decline in the trade gap last year is unlikely to become a regular event despite intense efforts by the White House to reverse years of large deficits. The U.S. simply no longer produces many of the goods that it imports heavily, such as clothing, cell phones, consumer electronics and certain industrial supplies.\n\nYet even though trade deficits subtract from gross domestic product, the U.S. economy is still growing at a steady pace and outperforming most other wealthy nations. That allows Americans to spend more on imported goods and, ironically, to contribute to chronic deficits.\n\nWhat they are saying? \"The trade war has taken a bite out of the trade deficit with China,\" said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.82% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.63% rose in Wednesday trades. Stocks have rebounded from a selloff that took place after the outbreak of the coronavirus last month.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.32% rose again to 1.64%.", "source": {"uri":

issues with competitors\n\nZoom Video Communications Inc. shares rallied for their best day in nearly eight months Monday as analysts said coronavirus fears and competitive questions seemed to drive investors toward the videoconferencing stock.\n\nZoom ZM, +14.89% shares closed up nearly 15% at $87.66, after touching an intraday high of $88.94, for their best one-day performance since June 7, when shares finished up more than 18%.\n\nStephens analyst Ryan MacWilliams, who has an overweight rating and a $95 price target on the stock, said fallout from the coronavirus is likely boosting Zoom's stock. China extended the Lunar New Year celebration through Sunday in an attempt to keep the virus from spreading, but some provinces and companies are telling workers to stay home longer, which could mean increased work done on teleconferences.\n\nIn a Monday note, MacWilliams said \"our buy-side contacts have noted increased investor interest around Zoom as a play on the coronavirus outbreak.\"\n\n\"We believe investors are betting on paid user growth as a result of increased cloud video meeting usage, due to concerns around physically meeting due to the coronavirus,\" he said. \"If this is the cause for the move in shares today, this increase seems extended to us, as China does not represent a significant business for Zoom (though 80% of their engineering team resides there).\"\n\nRead:\n\nEMJ Capital Ltd. founder Eric Jackson said in a tweet that China downloads of the app have jumped recently. Jackson, who said he is long on Zoom, told MarketWatch that he could not provide the source of his data.\n\nMacWilliams and another analyst, Piper Sandler's James Fish, also noted that a trading strategy that some investors used amid Zoom's rapid post-IPO rise could be facing difficulty. The trade called for a short on Zoom -- about 6.6% of Zoom's outstanding shares are shorted, according to FactSet data -- and a long bet on cloud-communications company RingCentral Inc. RNG, +0.09% .\n\n\"Other contacts we spoke with noted today's trading could be influenced through the continued unwinding of the short Zoom, long RingCentral trade,\" MacWilliams said.\n\nThere was a thought that RingCentral could be developing a stand-alone video offering that could challenge Zoom, especially for RingCentral customers that use Zoom for videoconferencing. RingCentral and Avaya Holdings Corp. AVYA, +0.39% that does not appear to be wholly owned by RingCentral.\n\n\"The solution will be featured at AvayaEngage 2020 this week, and initial expectations are that it is Avaya's video solution and not a solution that RingCentral developed as a stand-alone video solution,\" Fish wrote in a note.\n\nFish also noted that Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT, +2.44% .\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Bhavan Suri backed the view in a phone interview with MarketWatch. Suri told MarketWatch that investors are going long on Zoom because of \"coronavirus -- less travel, less face to face, more videoconferencing,\" and that there is \"possibly some short covering as well,\" following the company announcing Monday that its earnings report will come March 4.\n\nA request for comment from Zoom was still outstanding as of late Monday following the close of markets.\n\nOn Friday, after President Donald Trump declared coronavirus a , ordering a 14-day quarantine for citizens returning from China's Hubei province, and several airlines canceled flights to China.\n\nZoom , and shares have advanced 144% since pricing at $36 for its IPO.

The shares set a record closing high of $887.06 and an intraday high of $968.99 on Tuesday.\n\nAnalysts at Canaccord Genuity downgraded the stock to hold, from buy, saying that after its \"electrifying run\" there's a \"balanced risk reward for investors to lock in profits.\"\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak in China presents a clear headwind for Tesla's Shanghai factory and warrants a more pragmatic view on the stock, the analysts led by Jed Dorsheimer said.\n\nSee also:\n\nTesla last week , and warned the epidemic would likely have an impact on first-quarter profit as its Shanghai factory had been closed due government-mandated shutdowns.\n\n\"Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,\" the analysts said.\n\nSome on Wall Street have scratched their heads to explain Tesla's run in heavy volume, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note.\n\n\"While 4Q results were somewhat stronger than expected, the company's 2020 outlook for both volume and gross margin was not materially higher than consensus expectations,\" said the analysts, led by Adam Jonas.\n\n\"As such, many investors are struggling to identify a strong fundamental underpinning for the move,\" they said, keeping the equivalent of a hold on the stock.\n\nAnalysts at Wedbush kept their \"bull case\" for Tesla stock at $1,000 and cautioned that as February China deliveries are likely delayed due to the health emergency.\n\nRelated:\n\nThat's more like \"a small speed bump ... the current situation is more bark than bite as the aggressive trajectory of Giga 3 production and demand out of Shanghai look very strong out of the gates and the potential to hit 150k units/demand out of this region over the next year still remains intact,\" they said.\n\nSome also started to wonder whether Tesla would tap capital markets and pay off some of its debt.\n\n\"Their renewed access to equity capital could reduce their debt load significantly,\" said Eric Ross of Cascend Securities.
