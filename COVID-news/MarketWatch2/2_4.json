(As of Tuesday, the outbreak has still primarily impacted China, which has reported nearly 99% of the deaths and 97% of cases.)\n\nMessonnier said that Americans should talk to their children's schools about contingency education and childcare plans and tele-working options at work if community spread is reported in the U.S. When asked by a reporter on a conference call if her tone had changed compared to previous calls, Messonnier said: \"The data over the last week and the spread in other countries has certainly raised our level of concern and raised our level of expectation that we are going to have community spread here ... That's why we are asking folks in every sector as well as within their families to start planning for this.\"\n\nThe number of worldwide cases of COVID-19 ; there are now 80,238 cases in 34 countries and at least 2,700 deaths, according to WHO.\n\nWhile the number of new daily cases in China is waning, the number of new nations to report cases is rising as are the total cases in South Korea, which have soared, with 977 sickened and 10 dead. The government there on Tuesday announced a series of initiatives aimed at stemming the outbreak, including raising its infectious disease alert to the highest level and forbidding entry into the country from Hubei Province and Wuhan, the city in Hubei where the virus was first detected in December.\n\nThe South Korea outbreak arose largely from a religious event in Daegu. Since then, all citizens in that city have been asked not to leave their homes for two weeks.\n\nThe State Department on Saturday raised the travel warning levels for Japan and South Korea to a Level 2 warning, which urges people to exercise caution before traveling to those countries. It had raised Hong Kong to a Level 2 warning on Feb. 20. China has a Level 4 warning; the State Department is telling Americans not to travel to China right now.\n\nItaly is now reporting a number of infection clusters, primarily in Northern Italy, with 227 sickened and six dead. Cases there are largely mild; however, WHO officials said Monday that the \"rapid increase in reported cases in Italy over the past two days is of concern,\" particularly given the likely instances of human-to-human transmission of the virus. Italy has closed schools and bars and canceled mass gatherings such as sporting events in the regions where cases have been reported.\n\nIran has 61 cases and 12 deaths. In the U.S., there are now 57 cases, driven by an uptick in positive tests among those individuals who were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan. Kuwait is one of the newest nations to report a case, now with a total of eight cases. , Austria, Spain and Switzerland have also confirmed their first cases. Croatia's health ministry confirmed its first case.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had tweeted Monday that the virus is \"very much under control\" in the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday requested about $2.5 billion in funding for the outbreak, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is expected to face questions about the outbreak and the U.S. response in his four scheduled appearances on Capitol Hill this week, Raymond James' Chris Meekins said in a note on Tuesday. \"We continue to believe the virus is likely to get worse before it gets better, and that this issue will stretch at least into 2Q20,\" he added.\n\nHere's what companies are saying about the impact of COVID-19:\n\n* Wolverine World Wide Inc. WWW, -4.38% , citing the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its shoe brands, which include Hush Puppies, Sperry, and Stride Rite. The company reported a net loss of $900,000, or 1 cent a share, in the latest quarter, after earnings of $39.3 million, or 39 cents a share, in the year-ago period.\n\n* United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, -6.49% on Monday for 2020, saying the outbreak is too unpredictable to ensure that the forecast it issued two months ago will hold up. The airline has suspended flights to and from the Chinese cities of Beijing, Chengdu, and Shanghai as well as Hong Kong through April 24. Those flights were expected to make up 5% of United's 2020 planning capacity. As such, United \"is experiencing an approximately 100% decline in near-term demand to China and an approximately 75% decline in near-term demand on the rest of the Company's trans-Pacific routes.\"\n\n* Mastercard Inc. MA, -6.71% said Monday it expects to shave 2 to 3 percentage points from its first-quarter revenue guidance because of the impact of COVID-19 on \"cross-border travel and, to a lesser extent, cross-border e-commerce growth.\"\n\n* HP Inc. HPQ, +5.66% said it expects a \"negative impact to our top line, bottom line and [free cash flow],\" citing delayed production and manufacturing timelines. The technology giant said when taking into account the outbreak, it now anticipates earnings per share of 46 cents to 50 cents and adjusted EPS of 49 cents to 53 cents.\n\n* The Coca-Cola Co. KO, -1.42% \"will negatively impact our unit case volume and financial results for the first quarter of 2020\" because the drinks maker has seen delays in the production and export of ingredients used in nonnutritive sweeteners. It doesn't expect a hit to its full-year results for now.\n\nRead more of MarketWatch's COVID-19 coverage:", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"},

"title": "Trump 'shocked' by deadliness of flu  --  it's killed at least 16,000 Americans this season", "body": "As the world focuses on coronavirus, at least 29 million people in the U.S. have experienced flu illnesses this season, the CDC says.\n\nPublic health officials have warned Americansin the U.S., but the better-known flu virus is a far greater threat to Americans' health right now, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, about the novel coronavirus at a Wednesday press conference, said he was \"shocked\" to learn that the flu kills \"from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year.\" So far this flu season, 16,000 Americans have died from flu, according to the CDC.\n\nAs of Thursday, there were 82,549 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide and at least 2,810 deaths, The illness has now spread to more than 40 countries. A person in California who tested positive for the illness despite having not recently traveled to China was thought to be the first case of \"community spread\" in the U.S.\n\nAmericans have simply gotten used to influenza despite the staggering number of people it affects.\n\nThere were 60 confirmed cases in the U.S. as of Thursday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC this coronavirus \"a very serious public health threat,\" but adds that its immediate health risk to the American public is low. Health officials remain uncertain of exactly how the coronavirus spreads.\n\nIn contrast, at least 29 million people in the U.S. have experienced flu illnesses this season, . About 280,000 people have been hospitalized so far, and an estimated 16,000 have died, including 105 children.\n\nAmericans have simply gotten used to influenza despite the staggering number of people it affects, said Scott Weisenberg, a clinical associate professor of medicine and director of NYU Langone Health's travel medicine program.\n\n\"With influenza, it's fairly predictable: We see a fairly consistent number of individuals, sometimes higher, sometimes lower,\" he told MarketWatch. Coronavirus, on the other hand, \"went from having zero cases\" to a large number of cases in China and an emerging number of cases worldwide, he said. \"We don't know where it's going to end up.\"\n\nInfluenza \"remains a dangerous virus every single year,\" Weisenberg added. Groups at high risk for flu-related complications include adults aged 65 and over; pregnant women; young kids and children with neurological conditions; people living with conditions like diabetes, asthma, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and heart disease; and people who have had a stroke.\n\n29 million people in the U.S. have experienced flu illnesses this season, and an estimated 16,000 have died.\n\nChildren's and young adults' hospitalization rates are currently higher than those observed at this time in recent flu seasons, the CDC says, despite overall flu hospitalization rates staying around the same level. More than half of specimens that tested positive for influenza this season have been in people younger than 25.\n\nInfluenza B, which impacts young people more severely, has been reported more often this season on a national level, according to the CDC's most recent flu-surveillance report. But influenza A's has been more commonly reported in recent weeks.\n\nFor everyone six months and older, the CDC says getting the yearly flu vaccine is \"the single best way\" to ward off the seasonal flu virus. People should also steer clear of close contact with sick people; stay home from work and school when they're sick; cover their mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing; and clean their hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer, the CDC says.\n\n\"I would worry much more about influenza,\" Weisenberg said. \"And people should get a flu shot -- the flu is still active.\"\n\nJust 45% of U.S. adults last flu season , according to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Almost 63% of kids got a vaccine.\n\nWhile the CDC says estimates of this season's flu-vaccine effectiveness aren't yet available, it notes that research shows the flu vaccine of flu illness by 40% to 60% when the vaccine viruses are similar to the ones currently circulating.\n\nThe risk of an average American being exposed to coronavirus would be quite low right now, but that could change in coming weeks and months depending on how the virus spreads, Weisenberg said.\n\nWhile the CDC regularly publishes information on flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths that can be , health experts know far less about the new coronavirus, he added -- including the number of people with milder virus symptoms who could still transmit it to other people.\n\nIn , the CDC noted that the coronavirus's symptoms (which include cough and fever) were similar to flu symptoms, and that the coronavirus outbreak coincided with a season that brings a heightened prevalence of respiratory illnesses.\n\n\"Reducing the number of persons in the United States with seasonal influenza will reduce possible confusion with 2019-nCoV infection and possible additional risk to patients with seasonal influenza,\" the agency said.\n\n(This story was updated with new coronavirus figures on Feb. 27.)", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"},

fatality rates vary wildly depending on age, gender and medical history  --  some patients fare much worse than others", "body": "A new paper published in JAMA reviews a China-based sample of 72,000 COVID-19 cases, which suggests dramatic variations in the death rate of the illness\n\nAs the coronavirus spreads, scientists are learning more about the disease's fatality rate.\n\nThe medical journal JAMA this week analyzing data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 72,314 coronavirus cases in mainland China, the figure as of Feb. 11, the largest such sample in a study of this kind.\n\nThe sample's overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%, . No deaths occurred in those aged 9 years and younger, but cases in those aged 70 to 79 years had an 8% fatality rate and those aged 80 years and older had a fatality rate of 14.8%.\n\nNo deaths were reported among mild and severe cases. The fatality rate was 49% among critical cases, and elevated among those with preexisting conditions: 10.5% for people with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer.\n\nThe fatality rate was 49% among critical cases and worsened by those with preexisting conditions.\n\nThe latest China-based study, which was not peer-reviewed by U.S. scientists, found that men had a fatality rate of 2.8% versus 1.7% for women. Some doctors have said that women may have a stronger immune system as a to help babies during pregnancy.\n\nThe Chinese study is likely not representative of what might happen if the global spread of the virus worsens. In China, compared to roughly 2% of women, which could be one reason for the higher death rate among males.\n\nThere were 81,191 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and at least 2,768 deaths as of Wednesday, published by the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering's Centers for Systems Science and Engineering. (As of Wednesday morning, WHO's COVID-19 case dashboard, which had been regularly updated, was not working.)\n\nThe fatality rate of the novel coronavirus so far appears to be a fraction of that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4%). The fatality rate can affect how fast an outbreak spreads: If people die from an illness sooner, they are less likely to be working, shopping or flying on airplanes and, thus, less likely to spread the virus.\n\n\"COVID-19 rapidly spread from a single city to the entire country in just 30 days,\" the JAMA paper added. \"The sheer speed of both the geographical expansion and the sudden increase in numbers of cases surprised and quickly overwhelmed health and public-health services in China.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization said on Monday that the fatality rate in Wuhan, China, considered the epicenter of the outbreak, is between 2% and 4%. Outside of Wuhan, it is thought to be 0.7%.\n\nRecommended:\n\nThe majority of illnesses and deaths are in Hubei Province where Wuhan -- believed to be the epicenter of the outbreak -- is located. The illness has spread to around 40 countries or territories. (WHO has declared a global health emergency.)\n\nWhile the outbreak has largely affected China -- China's Hubei Province has reported 94% of total deaths and mainland China has 96% of total cases -- the emergence of COVID-19 clusters in these other countries has spooked markets this week, Johns Hopkins said.\n\nCoronavirus has an incubation period of up to two weeks, helping the virus to spread. suggests some patients may be more contagious than others. spread the virus to at least 10 health-care workers and four patients at a hospital in Wuhan.\n\n'The sheer speed of both the geographical expansion and the sudden increase in numbers of cases surprised and quickly overwhelmed health and public-health services in China.'\n\n\"In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and [the] mortality was 4.3%.\"\n\n. \"The incubation period for SARS is typically 2 to 7 days, although in some cases it may be as long as 10 days,\" the CDC said at the time. \"In a very small proportion of cases, incubation periods of up to 14 days have been reported.\"\n\nMaciej Boni, an associate professor of biology, at Pennsylvania State University, that the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic initially overestimated the final fatality rate, while the SARS fatality rate rose as the virus spread.\n\nInitially, scientists estimated a fatality rate of 7%. \"However, the initially reported information of 850 cases was a gross underestimate,\" Boni wrote. \"This was simply due to a much larger number of mild cases that did not report to any health system and were not counted.\"\n\n\"After several months -- when pandemic data had been collected from many countries experiencing an epidemic wave -- the 2009 influenza turned out to be much milder than was thought in the initial weeks. Its case fatality was lower than 0.1% and in line with other known human influenza viruses.\"\n\n\"Every now and then a disease becomes so dangerous that it kills the host,\" Matan Shelomi, an entomologist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University, . But, ideally for the host at least, it must strike a balance.\n\n\"If the disease is able to spread to another host before the first host dies, then it is not too lethal to exist. Evolution cannot make it less lethal so long as it can still spread,\" he added. \"If a hypothetical disease eradicates its only host, both will indeed go extinct.\"\n\nDon't miss:", "source": {"uri":

That means the Dow is approaching correction territory at 26,596.28, defined as a drop of at least 10%, but not greater than 20%, from a recent peak.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 SPX, +1.36% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.69% finished sharply lower. The S&P 500 is off 7.6% from its recent record high on Feb. 19 and has shed nearly $1.74 trillion this week, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a Tuesday research note.\n\nThe Nasdaq is off 8.6% from its Feb. 19 all-time closing high. Put another way, its recent decline is 1.4 percentage points from representing a correction. That would occur at the 8,835.46 level.\n\nHere's are 5 reasons that the market is falling:\n\nCOVID-19\n\nFear of the COVID-19 disease infecting the U.S. is intensifying. The illness derived from the novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China, late last year, is starting to affect global trade and travel and taking a bite out of confidence about earnings and economic growth.\n\nNancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that \"the disruption of daily life might be severe.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization hasn't declared the viral infection a pandemic, but the disease, from the family of viruses known as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, has sickened people in China, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Italy and Iran. And , Austria, Spain, Croatia and Switzerland have also confirmed their first cases.\n\nThe virus has virtually crippled swaths of manufacturing in China, the second largest economy in the world, and the country is a big buyer of products and services from other countries. U.S. technology companies such as Apple Inc. AAPL, +3.00% depend on Chinese supplies.\n\nRead:\n\nInvestors don't know how long the outbreak will last, and it is too early to determine to what degree it will hurt corporate earnings, but , including Hasbro Inc. HAS, +1.58%, HP Inc. HPQ, -0.24% and Mastercard Inc. MA, +0.96%, have already said that they think it will.\n\nThe 2020 election\n\nUncertainty about the U.S. presidential election's outcome , strategists and analysts argue. A number of them think that if Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who characterizes himself as a democratic socialist, wins the Democratic presidential nomination, and possibly even the presidency, stocks would take a hit as he is perceived by some as an antibusiness candidate. \"The risk to U.S. stocks is pretty significant if Bernie gets the nomination,\" said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst with OANDA.\n\nLofty valuations\n\nEven before the market slump this week, the value of stocks has been viewed as rich.\n\nOne measure of stock-market values showed that the S&P 500 index was trading at 18.9 times the weighted aggregate consensus forward earnings estimate among analysts polled by MarketWatch. That is up from 16.2 a year ago, and, aside from a brief point early in 2018, it is the highest forward price-to-earnings ratio for the benchmark index since May 2002.\n\nThe bond market\n\nGovernment bonds yields have been sliding steadily as investors seek safe havens, and thus drive up bond prices, amid doubts about global economic growth in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.19% carved fell to earlier Tuesday, and the 30-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD30Y, +0.16% rate last week.\n\nRecession fears\n\nBond investors fear that the coronavirus might result in a global economic slowdown that might wash up on U.S. shores as . MarketWatch economics writer Rex Nutting explained the potential for an uncontained outbreak of COVID-19 this way: \"Much of the immediate economic impact of a pandemic can be traced to the efforts to contain it, rather than from the effects of the disease itself. As we attempt to quarantine those who might spread the disease, we shut down a lot of economic activity.\"\n\nA study found that a pandemic \"could produce a short-run impact on the worldwide economy similar in depth and duration to that of an average postwar recession in the United States.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"title": "The Dow tumbled more than 1,000 points and marked its third-worst point drop in history  --  here's how the stock market tends to perform after big drops", "body": "It finally happened.\n\nA bona fide selloff took hold Monday on Wall Street after investors spent weeks attempting to come to terms with the potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak as it spreads in countries outside of China, notably Italy and Iran, threatening to dent global supply chains and economies.\n\nThere are now 79,339 cases of COVID-19 -- the infectious disease derived from the novel strain of coronavirus that reportedly originated in Wuhan, China, last year -- in 30 countries, and 2,619 deaths,\n\nThird-biggest point drop...ever\n\nmarks the third-biggest daily point drop for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -3.56% in its 124-year history. The blue-chip benchmark closed 1,031.61 points, or 3.56%, lower, to end at 27,961, not far from the intraday low at 27,912.44.\n\nDate Point change % change Feb. 5 -1,175 points -4.60% Feb. 8 -1,032 -4.15 Feb. 24 (at low) -1,031.61 -3.56%\n\nTo be sure, such point drops are less meaningful because the Dow has been trading at lofty levels. For example, the was a 508-point decline but that fall represented a 23% plunge back then.\n\nNeed to Know:\n\n1.32% or bust\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.24% tumbled more than 10 basis points to trade at 1.367% on Monday, just shy of its June 2016 record low of 1.32%. Bond prices rise as yields fall. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.14% , known as the long bond, hit an all-time low last week, raising worries that bond investors are betting on economic pain ahead.\n\nGovernment bonds have been hovering around lows even as stocks have been climbing, an odd dynamic in the market and has implied that investors are unsettled by the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak.\n\n3% or worse\n\nMonday's selloff marks the first time all three major benchmarks -- the Dow, the S&P 500 index SPX, -3.35%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.71% -- each fell by at least 3% on the same day since Dec. 4, 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\n11 sectors\n\nThe 11 sectors of the S&P 500 index all finished in the red, led by a 4.74% decline in the energy sector XLE, -4.62%, which suffered the worst daily percentage loss since Aug. 24, 2015.\n\nAll 30\n\nAll 30 of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's components finished lower, led by a whopping 7.8% decline in shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, -7.84%, . The fall in the health insurer exacted a toll of more than 160 points on the price-weighted blue-chip benchmark.\n\nNegative for the year\n\nMonday's downturn has wiped out this year's gains for the Dow (now -2.02%) and the S&P 500 (now -0.15%).\n\n50-day\n\nThe S&P 500 breached its 50-day moving average for the first time since October. Technical analysts view moving averages as dividing lines between long-term and short-term bullish and bearish averages. The S&P 500's 50-day moving average stands at 3,275.90 (see chart below).\n\nThe Dow also closed well below its 50-day moving average at 28,805.54, and slightly above its 200-day moving average at 27,224.03.\n\nWorth a read:\n\nRead:\n\nCheck out:\n\nSo how does the market tend to perform in this aftermath?\n\nDespite all the relative carnage being endured by the market, stocks have a tendency to rebound after a hit of at least 2%, Dow Jones Market Data shows.\n\nThe past 10 times that the S&P 500 index fell by as much as 3%, for example, it declined 0.27%, on average, in the next trading session. However, the average performance improved dramatically in the following week, month and year, as shown in the table below:\n\nTime frame Performance S&P 500 after it has fallen at least 3% in one day Day after -0.27% 1 week after 1.83% 1 month after 2.08% 1 year after 12.97%\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow has a similar record.\n\nTime frame Performance Dow after it has fallen at least 3% in one day Day after -0.19% 1 week after 2.07% 1 month after 2.93% 1 year after 12.52%\n\nTo be sure, how the market performs in the past is no guarantee of what it will do in the future. On top of that, an epidemic that gets out of control could lead to unprecedented results for the market and economy. , the market has eventually rebounded, however.\n\nThe researchers at Bespoke Investment Group also make the case that, over the past 11 years, declines of more than 2% for the S&P 500 have tended to see healthy rebounds, particularly when that daily slide happens on a Monday.\n\n\"Since March 2009, there have been 18 prior 2%+ drops on Mondays, and SPY has seen an average gain of 1.02% on the next day (Turnaround Tuesday),\" the analysts wrote Monday.

"title": "Stock-market expert says what many are thinking as Dow sheds 3,600 points in a week: 'This market is not normal'", "body": "The breadth and intensity of this week's coronavirus-fueled selloff in U.S. stocks has some analysts scratching their heads.\n\nThomas Lee, founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, may be one of the few to acknowledge that something isn't right with a market that was just enjoying a record close days ago.\n\n\"This is not normal, and the market is clearly indicating to us a change,\" Lee said in a research report on Friday.\n\nRead:\n\nLee said the oddities playing out in the market, including two and potentially three days of 1,000-point drops in the same week for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.39% , signifies four things (though his tongue may be planted firmly in his cheek on the last item):\n\nA significant change in economic fundamentals A significant increase in 'risk' to the fundamentals The market's financial plumbing is breaking down A meteor or alien invasion to end global existence has been spotted but its arrival is unknown (or a virus pandemic)\n\nAt last check, Dow Jones Industrial Average was closed down more than 360 points Friday, and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.82% was off less than 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.01% finished the session virtually unchanged. Still, the three major benchmarks notched their worst weekly declines since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nInvestors are worried that the outbreak of COVID-19, the infectious disease that originated in Wuhan, China, late last year, will hurt global economies and supply chains if the illness isn't contained.\n\nCheck out:\n\nLee said fear surrounding the uncertain impact of the virus is a credible issue but added that he believes investors may be overreacting. \"Because of the idiosyncratic nature of a potential pandemic, it is really difficult to know when it is priced in,\" he said.\n\nHe made the case that \"markets are bottoming this week\" even heading into a weekend where uncertainties could deliver a fresh wallop to confidence. He is forecasting a so-called \"V\"-shaped, or sharp, recovery for the market.\n\nHe also noted that his optimistic forecast could be impeded by further negative reports of the viral outbreak but said that he wouldn't be surprised if the government kicks in surprise plans to help stanch the bleeding in markets.

The 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -8.54% rate was at 1.12% on Friday, trading at a fresh record low for the benchmark debt.\n\nDallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said Friday about the need for a rate cut when the Fed's interest-rate committee meets again on March 17-18. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said interest-rate cuts if a global pandemic actually develops.\n\nHowever, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a rare, unplanned statement on Friday in support of the economy amid the outbreak.\n\nRead:\n\nAlso read:", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_decambre@marketwatch.com", "name": "Mark DeCambre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASDAQ Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007\u20132008", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Dallas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_B._Bullard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James B.

The U.S. stock market suffered its worst week since 2008. Financial advisers are getting phone calls from panicked clients who just watched someone on TV say markets are going to drop further. Some clients are asking their adviser if they should get out of the stock market and go to cash.\n\nAmid this turmoil, how do financial advisers stay calm? Are they just pretending while inside they're just as nervous as you are about their own money? After all, they have retirement savings, bills to pay and families to support.\n\nHere are four common behaviors I've observed during tumultuous world events while working alongside fellow fee-only certified financial planners managing diversified portfolio strategies using index funds and exchange-traded funds. Advisers spend a lot of time educating their clients about what it means to be a successful investor -- most importantly to expect sudden drops in the market.\n\nI'll say this up front: the advisers I've worked with never sold their own investments while markets were getting hammered. What other habits of theirs are effective?\n\n1. They don't constantly look at their account balances: For one thing, advisers are too busy answering client calls. Most advisers wait to check their own accounts after the markets have recovered, if at all. Advisers know first-hand how such behavior can destroy wealth.\n\nAre you obsessed with the latest market carnage or even worse, making impulsive changes to your investment accounts? Try creating a longer and complicated account password. (We all need to do this to make our accounts more secure.) Then forget to remember it.\n\n2. They take care of themselves: When the going gets tough, advisers get plenty of exercise and sleep, eat healthier, and spend time with family and friends. In this way, they're better able to help their clients gain perspective and peace around the market's turmoil.\n\n3. They don't try to catch a falling knife: Ever notice how after markets fall sharply, there's always someone quoted in the financial news or on TV saying the market is now a \"buy\" and \"fairly valued\" or even \"undervalued\"? Ever wonder how they know this? They don't.\n\nPlus, these \"experts\" may be speaking to an entirely different target audience than you, which includes day traders, short sellers, momentum traders, and various other kinds of professional money managers who make big bets on the short-term direction of the markets. None of these categories describes you, but there's no disclaimer running across the bottom of your TV screen telling you this.\n\nAdvisers are aware that market corrections can end quickly or drag on for weeks or months. In the worst bear markets, it feels like stocks will keep falling forever. Then, when you least expect it the market will begin to rise.\n\nSo instead of trying to guess entry points, advisers do something boring but tried and true. They proceed with the scheduled annual rebalancing of their own and their clients' accounts, no matter what's going on in the markets. This assures they're increasing their holdings in asset classes that have fallen (losers) and reducing their investments in asset classes that have done well (winners). This is one of the surest ways to buy low and sell high without trying to time the market.\n\n4. They know it isn't different this time:. The scariest world events are always unique -- that's why they're so scary. We don't know what to expect at such times because we haven't experienced anything exactly like it in the past.\n\nThis time the scary world event is novel coronavirus COVID-19. I'm not downplaying it at all because it's a legitimate fear. Last time the financial markets were rocked so hard, a dozen years ago, it was due to the housing bust.

Just how big, no one really knows.\n\nLast week, it seemed as if financial markets believed that COVID-19 would be contained. But new cases in Italy, South Korea and Iran over the weekend undermined that belief. The World Health Organization on Monday, saying the disease was not yet a pandemic because it was not spreading in an uncontained way.\n\nNo matter, stock markets GDOW, -4.29% SPX, -1.09% and other financial markets BUXX, -0.23% TMUBMUSD10Y, -3.22% GC00, -1.07% were one in which hundreds of millions of people would be infected, and millions would die.\n\nAlso read:\n\nNasty, brutish and short\n\nInvestors are just beginning to price in the possibility of a sharp and nasty global recession that would be followed by a rapid rebound once the disease has run its course. Whenever that will be.\n\nIn the longer run, of course, a pandemic could have more far-reaching effects, including a smaller and less productive workforce and even a reordering of globalization.\n\nA pandemic 'could produce a short-run impact on the worldwide economy similar in depth and duration to that of an average postwar recession in the United States,' the CBO found.\n\nWe'd like to think that we can know the worst that could happen, but there is still so much that isn't known about COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that emerged in China and now spreading around the world. Most of the economic analysis is based on past pandemics, such as the 1918 global influenza pandemic, and more recent bouts with avian flu, SARS and MERS.\n\nNothing like it in recent history\n\nBut none of those examples fit the current situation perfectly. For one thing, unlike the flu, no one in the world has any natural immunity to this disease, nor is there a vaccine. The coronavirus is quite contagious, and many more people are likely to get COVID-19 than is assumed in these generic pandemic simulations.\n\nThe more recent pandemics weren't nearly as widespread or deadly as this one seems to be. People who don't appear to be sick can transmit the virus, making efforts to contain its spread magnitudes more difficult.\n\nWhat's more, the 1918 flu pandemic occurred in a different world, the world before airlines shrank the world, the world before globalization knitted our economies closer than ever, and the world before the internet, a technology that can spread misinformation and fear virally around the globe in an instant.\n\nFor example, the 1918 pandemic didn't seem to have much impact on global trade or financial markets. Compare that to what we've already seen with COVID-19. Here's .\n\nThat means the economic impact of a global pandemic of these proportions could be much larger than what investors and policy makers have assumed.\n\nCould GDP contract 4.5%?\n\nMany economists have tried to model the economic consequences of a pandemic.\n\nin 2005 and 2006, modeling the impact of a 1918-sized flu pandemic on the economy. They found that a pandemic \"could produce a short-run impact on the worldwide economy similar in depth and duration to that of an average postwar recession in the United States.\" Specifically, a severe pandemic could reduce U.S. gross domestic product by about 4.5%, followed by a sharp rebound.\n\nThe CBO assumed that 90 million people in the U.S. would get sick, and 2 million would die. There would also be demand-side effects, with an 80% decline in the arts and entertainment industries and a 67% decline in transportation. Retail and manufacturing would drop 10%.\n\nThe U.S. wasn't prepared for a flu pandemic then, the CBO said, and it isn't now.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\"If a pandemic were to occur in the near term, the options for the United States would be limited to attempts to control the spread of the virus and judicious use of limited medical facilities, personnel, and supplies,\" the bipartisan agency concluded. \"In the longer term, more tools are potentially available, including an increased treatment capacity, greater use of vaccines and antiviral drug stockpiles, and possible advances in medical technology.\"\n\nOther simulations of the U.S. and non-U.S. economies have found similar economic impacts, although that research came at an earlier stage of globalization, when our economy was not quite so reliant on far-flung supply chains.\n\nQuarantining the economy\n\nMuch of the immediate economic impact of a pandemic can be traced to the efforts to contain it, rather than from the effects of the disease itself. As we attempt to quarantine those who might spread the disease, we shut down a lot of economic activity.\n\nThe quarantines might be the only way to slow the spread of COVID-19, but they could also hamper our response. Our health-care system also relies on vital inputs for medicines, supplies and equipment produced all over the world, including China and other hard-hit Asian economies. And of course we rely on the free flow of thousands of other goods and services.\n\nThe potential for disaster is sobering. The economies of the world are extraordinarily resilient, yet extraordinarily dependent upon each other in a crisis. Sadly, the things we need most to get us through this -- wise leadership, global cooperation and clear thinking -- are harder to find than a surgical mask.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com",

"title": "Here are 5 reasons the stock market is having its worst decline since 2008, and only one of them is the coronavirus", "body": "Why is the stock market falling? Here are a few opinions that experts have floated\n\nThe U.S. stock-market rally has unraveled, with a period of historic gains coming to a screeching halt, as fear that the coronavirus epidemic may reach America rattles Wall Street.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -4.42% fell into , widely defined as a drop of at least 10%, but no more than 20%, from a recent peak. The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite indexes all joined the blue chips in correction territory.\n\nHowever, it is the speed at which the indexes fell into these conditions that has surprised investors and some experts on Wall Street. It was the fastest decline into correction for the Dow, 10 sessions, since the nine-session slump into correction on Feb. 8, 2018.\n\nCorrections from a Record Close Record Close Enters Correction Date Trading days Nov. 3, 1919 Nov. 12, 1919 7 Nov. 28, 1928 Dec. 8, 1928 8 Jan. 26, 2018 Feb. 8, 2018 9 Feb. 12, 2020 Feb. 27, 2020 10 Sept. 23, 1955 Oct. 11, 1955 12\n\nFor both the S&P 500 SPX, -4.42% and the Nasdaq COMP, -4.61%, it was the fastest retreat on record from a record high, six sessions ago, to correction.\n\nThursday's declines also put on pace for their worst weeks since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nHere's are 5 reasons that the market is falling:\n\nCOVID-19 infects confidence\n\nFear of the COVID-19 disease infecting the U.S. is intensifying. The illness derived from the novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China, late last year, is starting to affect global trade and travel and taking a bite out of confidence about earnings and economic growth.\n\nSeven days ago, Goldman Sachs chief global equity strategist that \"in the nearer term...we believe the greater risk is that the impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices, suggesting that the risks of a correction are high.\"\n\nGoldman made a similar this time from strategist David Kostin, saying there would be no earnings growth in 2020.\n\nRisks have intensified since Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that \"the disruption of daily life might be severe.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's failed to provide investors with much comfort, mostly because it is difficult to predict how the virus will play out here and elsewhere.\n\nThe World Health Organization hasn't declared the viral infection a pandemic, but the disease, from the family of viruses known as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, has sickened people in China, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Italy and Iran. And , Austria, Spain, Croatia and Switzerland have also confirmed their first cases.\n\nThe virus has virtually crippled swaths of manufacturing in China, the world's second-largest economy, and the country is a big buyer of products and services from other countries. U.S. technology companies such as Apple Inc. AAPL, -6.54% depend on Chinese supplies.\n\n, COVID-19 has sickened 82,550 people, and claimed 2,810 lives.\n\nRead:\n\nInvestors don't know how long the outbreak will last, and it is too early to determine to what degree it will hurt corporate earnings, but , including Hasbro Inc. HAS, -3.62%, HP Inc. HPQ, -3.65% and Mastercard Inc. MA, -4.10%, have already said that they think it will.\n\nCheck out:\n\nAlso read:\n\nRelated:\n\nThe 2020 election\n\nUncertainty about the U.S. presidential election's outcome , strategists and analysts argue. A number of them think that if Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who characterizes himself as a democratic socialist, wins the Democratic presidential nomination, and possibly even the presidency, stocks would take a hit as he is perceived by some as an antibusiness candidate. \"The risk to U.S. stocks is pretty significant if Bernie gets the nomination,\" said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst with Oanda.\n\nLofty valuations\n\nEven before the market slump this week, the value of stocks has been viewed as rich.\n\nOne measure of stock-market values showed that the S&P 500 index was trading at 18.9 times the weighted aggregate consensus forward earnings estimate among analysts polled by MarketWatch. That is up from 16.2 a year ago, and, aside from a brief point early in 2018, it is the highest forward price-to-earnings ratio for the benchmark index since May 2002.\n\nThe bond market\n\nGovernment bonds yields have been sliding steadily as investors seek havens, and thus drive up bond prices, amid doubts about global economic growth in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.61% fell to on Thursday at one point.\n\nRecession fears\n\nBond investors fear that the coronavirus might result in a global economic slowdown that might wash up on U.S. shores as . MarketWatch economics writer Rex Nutting explained the potential for an uncontained outbreak of COVID-19 this way: \"Much of the immediate economic impact of a pandemic can be traced to the efforts to contain it, rather than from the effects of the disease itself. As we attempt to quarantine those who might spread the disease, we shut down a lot of economic activity.\"\n\nA study found that a pandemic \"could produce a short-run impact on the worldwide economy similar in depth and duration to that of an average postwar recession in the United States.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

With the S&P 500 SPX, -1.59% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.79% headed for their worst weeks since the 2008 financial crisis, when markets were rocked by the creation of complex mortgage securities that spread across the globe.\n\nThis time the spread of the new coronavirus, a family of viruses similar to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, has injected a level of complexity into markets that is unsettling what had been predominantly bullish sentiment on Wall Street.\n\nThe S&P 500 index's 11.7% weekly decline also puts it at among the 10 worst weekly slumps for the index thus far.\n\nThe decline from its record high also ranks as its fastest such reversal on record for the S&P 500, Deutsche Bank analysts point out.\n\nHere's the weekly performance for the benchmark's 11 sectors, in the attached chart, as of Thursday's close:\n\nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a weekly decline off 10.47%, which would rank this week's drop as the 8th worst of its nearly 50-year history, with a decline of 25.3% ended April 13, 2000, representing its worst weekly skid.\n\nRead:\n\nThe viral outbreak has analysts at Goldman Sachs slashing their outlook for S&P

officials to warn Americans about potential disruption if COVID-19 cases start to spread\n\nPublic health officials, concerned about the possible spread of the coronavirus-borne disease COVID-19 in U.S. communities, are urging Americans to ask schools and workplaces about contingency plans.\n\nThis may include questions about the possibility of school and day-care closures, policies around working at home and using videoconferencing tools for meetings, and telehealth options for medical care.\n\n\"I contacted my local school superintendent this morning with exactly those questions,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has largely been confined to China, which accounts for the majority of deaths. The illness has sickened at least 80,238 people in 34 countries and caused 2,700 deaths since it . The impact outside of China so far has been limited, with the majority of cases occurring in people who had recently traveled to Wuhan, the surrounding Hubei Province or elsewhere in mainland China.\n\nRead now:\n\nHowever, the rapid jump in cases in Iran, Italy and South Korea over the last four days has tripped up markets and has now prompted U.S. health officials to warn Americans about potential disruptions at home if people start getting sick in their communities. Messonnier cited examples of \"community spread\" in Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.\n\nSee also:\n\nIn Italy, there are at least 227 cases and six people have died, according to figures published Tuesday by the World Health Organization. (The WHO website tracking COVID-19 cases and deaths is currently offline.) The health organization said Monday that Italy has closed schools and bars and canceled events, , in regions where clusters of infections have been reported.\n\nThe U.S. has 57 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, according to Messonnier. That includes 40 passengers who tested positive for COVID-19 after returning to the U.S. from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan; three people who had been repatriated from Wuhan; 12 individuals who had recently traveled to China; and two of their spouses. The transmissions of the virus between members of the two married couples are the only instances of familial spread in the U.S.\n\nRead:\n\n\"Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country,\" Messonnier said. \"It's not so much a question of if ... but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\"\n\nShe cited three forms of \"\" that can be applied during a pandemic of a respiratory disease to lessen the spread of an illness. These include the personal steps of staying home if you're sick; the community actions of closing schools or canceling large gatherings of people; and the environmental approach of routinely cleaning surfaces.\n\nIt could also include delaying elective medical procedures.\n\n\"Secondary consequences of some of these measures might include missed work and loss of income,\" Messonnier said.\n\nThe said Tuesday that he's confident the U.S. would be able to avoid a recession even if other countries experience one. Speaking on CNBC, Kudlow said China would take \"an awfully big hit\" economically from the coronavirus but that recent data show the U.S. is holding up well.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -3.15% , after shedding more than 1,000 points on Monday -- the by points lost.

quarantine sites, whistleblower says", "body": "HHS employee claims lack of safety training, no screenings before flights home\n\nWASHINGTON -- A whistleblower alleges that some federal employees were sent to work at coronavirus quarantine locations in California without adequate safety protocols and then flew back home on commercial airplanes, according to a person familiar with the complaint against the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe complaint, which HHS said it was evaluating, focuses on some employees who work at the Administration for Children and Families, or ACF, an HHS division that handles programs such as Head Start and disaster emergency response and that performed functions at some of the quarantine camps. The U.S. repatriated Americans from China on planes chartered by the State Department in early February. They were subject to 14-day quarantines.\n\nEmployees didn't receive prior safety training relevant to the California assignment, according to the person familiar with the complaint. One employee who declined to go to one of the quarantine sites said she was then reassigned, the person said. The employees weren't tested for the coronavirus before they left two California quarantine sites, the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside and Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, and flew home, the person familiar with the complaint said. There is no evidence that any of the workers contracted or spread the virus.\n\nIn response to the complaint, Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman at HHS, said Thursday: \"We take all whistleblower complaints very seriously and are providing the complainant all appropriate protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act.
