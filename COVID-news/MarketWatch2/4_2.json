The \"Good Neighbor Relief Program\" offers a 25% policy credit on premiums due from March 20 through May 31, or about $20 a month for each vehicle insured. The average annual State Farm auto premium is approximately $950 a year, the insurer said.\n\nThe big car insurers have announced their initiatives in a flurry this week. Allstate Corp.

But the lawsuit from Evans' estate alleges the retailer quickly hired new employees over the phone or through other \"remote means\" without checking if new workers might have COVID-19.\n\nThe massive retailer has been adding extra cleaning steps, installing sneeze guards at registers, limiting the amount of customers in a store at any one time and putting decals on the floor to remind shoppers about social distancing rules, Hargrove said.\n\nThere were 12,262 confirmed cases in Illinois and 307 deaths as of Monday, according to numbers There were 356,942 confirmed cases and 10,524 deaths in the U.S. as of Monday evening, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nWalmart shares are up 6% from the start of the year.

the malaria-drug maker Sanofi could be as small as $99", "body": "As President Donald Trump has persistently discussed the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, critics have wondered about his motivation, given the drug's far-from-certain performance on the global stage as a treatment for coronavirus, and the Food and Drug Administration's refusal so far to approve it as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nThe New York Times in Sanofi, the French drug manufacturer that produces the drug.\n\nThe report doesn't say how small, but it notes that his three family trusts have investments in a Dodge & Cox mutual fund whose largest holding is Sanofi. A fund that matches this description is the Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund DODFX, +5.81%, which at last check was 3.3% invested in Sanofi.\n\nTrump's 2019 financial-disclosure form lists stakes in Family Trusts 1, 2 and 3 valued at between $1,001 and $15,000. So if Trump has the maximum $15,000 in each of the trusts, he holds a stake in Sanofi that's worth $1,485 -- and, at the minimum, just $99.\n\nIt turns out he does look to have more than that modest sum invested in Sanofi, because, unmentioned in the Times report, his trusts also hold broader European stock-market index funds.\n\nThe iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF IEFA, +3.21% has 0.67% of its holdings in Sanofi, and Sanofi is a 0.78% holding for the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF EFA, +3.15%, which is neither surprising nor notable, in that the French drug maker is so large.\n\nAnd Trump has a small stake in basically every big company you can think of.\n\nIn each of the trusts, the biggest fund holding is just the broader SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, +3.43%, in which Trump holds between $200,000 and $450,000, according to his financial-disclosure forms.\n\nSo one could say Trump has $22,000 or so invested in Microsoft MSFT, +1.53%, and nearly as much in Apple AAPL, +2.86%.\n\nAnother point worth making is how little the malaria drug means to Sanofi's bottom line. In 2019, what the company calls Plaquenil wasn't even broken out by name in the company's financial accounts, while 33 other medications were.\n\nThat is hardly surprising as the drug has been around since the 1950s and is available generically.\n\nA host of other companies are making the medication, including Amneal Pharmaceuticals AMRX, +1.91%, Mylan MYL, +2.27% and Teva Pharmaceutical TEVA, +3.91%.\n\nRead on:", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_goldstein@marketwatch.com", "name": "Steve Goldstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanofi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_&_Cox", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dodge & Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSCI_EAFE", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSCI EAFE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IShares", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IShares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutual fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_&_Poor's_Depositary_Receipts", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Index fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mylan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teva_Pharmaceutical_Industries", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teva Pharmaceutical Industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pharmaceutical industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-ID931_trump__ZG_20200407091237.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 3439}, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 3439, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6027698508", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-10", "time": "16:54:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-10T16:54:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-10T16:53:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/iceland-finds-that-half-its-citizens-with-coronavirus-have-shown-no-symptoms-2020-04-10", "title": "Iceland finds that half its citizens with coronavirus have shown no symptoms", "body": "The island nation has tested more of its population for COVID-19 than any other country\n\nBig data can come from small places.\n\nIceland's isolated location and sparse population mean that some vital information about the novel coronavirus is coming out of the island nation -- especially considering that it's already tested 10% of its population, which is more than any other country, .\n\nAnd the scariest finding: At any given time, about half of its citizens who have the coronavirus -- and don't know it -- are not showing any symptoms.

(The actual population of Iceland, long a favorite of biotech research because of its relative homogeneity and its centuries' worth of genealogical records, is 364,134 -- roughly the same as that of Tulsa, Okla.)\n\nPresident Trump said in an April 6 press briefing that almost 2 million Americans, or 0.6% of the U.S. population, had been tested for COVID-19. The also warned of testing-supply shortages and long wait times.\n\nSo that means the \"best data\" on coronavirus is coming from Iceland at the moment, John P.A. Ioannidis of Stanford University told USA Today. And Kari Stefansson, CEO of deCODE genetics, which is helping to carry out Iceland's testing efforts, said that Iceland may be one of the best live coronavirus laboratories we have in the world as it continues to randomly test its people.\n\nAnd it's already made some important discoveries. Among them: that between 0.3% and 0.8% of Iceland's population is infected with the coronavirus, while half of those who tested positive were asymptomatic as the time of their tests.\n\n\"That's a bit scary,\" said Stefansson. \"They could be spreading it and not knowing it.\"\n\nBut since mid-March, the prevalence of COVID-19 among Iceland's general population that's not at the greatest risk -- that is, not of advanced age or with underlying health conditions -- has either stayed stable or decreased, showing that social-distancing and containment efforts are working.\n\nWhile Iceland has not imposed a national lockdown, and many shops and businesses are still open, it has banned gatherings of more than 20 people. It's otherwise mostly relying on a trust system that its citizens are practicing isolation and social distancing. As of April 10, the country counted more than 1,600 coronavirus infections and six deaths.\n\nFor the most current information on coronavirus in the U.S., including tips on social distancing,", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_lyn_pesce@marketwatch.com", "name": "Nicole Lyn Pesce", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d3lafur_Stef\u00e1nsson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00d3lafur Stef\u00e1nsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tulsa, Oklahoma"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCODE_genetics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeCODE genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Containment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Testing_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Testing and Tools", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-IE217_Icelan_ZG_20200410123134.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 2729}, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 2729, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6024154762", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-08", "time": "00:18:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-08T00:18:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-08T00:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fauci-says-he-thinks-schools-will-be-able-to-reopen-in-the-fall-2020-04-07", "title": "Fauci says he thinks schools will be able to reopen in the fall", "body": "While it is not a certainty, it is likely that schools will be able to reopen in the fall, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Tuesday.\n\n\"I fully expect -- though I'm humble enough that I can't accurately predict -- that by the time we get to the fall that we will have this under control enough, that it certainly will not be the way it is now -- where people are shutting schools,\" Fauci said at the daily coronavirus briefing at the White House.\n\n\"My optimistic side tells me we will be able to renew,\" he added.\n\n\"But it is going to be different\" because the coronavirus won't disappear, he warned.\n\nCommunities will have to have the ability to identify the virus, isolate infected patients and trace the source of the infection, he added.\n\n\"Bottom line, no absolute prediction.

They can also emphasize the fact they are driving much less, just like many others. That makes the driver less risky to insure and justifies a lower premium, Hunter said.\n\nPolicyholders can tell their company, \"your risk is way lower, so my premium I paid is too high,\" Hunter said. Another strategy could be to at least ask for an adjustment in the amount of mileage that's factored into a premium, he added.\n\nLast month, Hunter sent letters to states' insurance commissioners urging premium discounts in light of the outbreak.\n\nIt's likely other insurers will also make some sort of deal with car insurance policyholders, said Penny Gusner, senior consumer analyst at , a website that compares price quotes.\n\n\"Now that a few of the bigger companies are offering money-back, during a time when many really could really use it, it may be bad optics to resist,\" she said in a statement.\n\nIt might be a good time for some to shop around, but drivers shouldn't cancel their coverage altogether without a new policy in place, Gusner said. Many states penalize drivers who have a registered car without insurance and insurance companies can charge for a lapse in premiums, she noted.\n\nEven if insurers aren't currently giving refunds or credits, they may be offering perks like lengthening grace periods or waiving late fees, she said.\n\nA driver will pay an average $1,427 on car insurance during 2020, according to the personal finance website .\n\nCar traffic has plummeted as states impose \"shelter in place\" orders and scores of companies have .

Some schools eligible for bailout funds have settled lawsuits with the U.S. Justice Department following allegations of fraud and misuse of federal student aid.\n\nThe exclusive analysis echoes concerns about the amount of funding available to the for-profit education sector. In an April 6 letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a group of U.S. senators argued that for-profit colleges should not be eligible for stimulus money. The letter -- sent by Democratic Party senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Richard Durbin of Illinois, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut -- demanded \"strong accountability policies to support students and protect taxpayers.\"\n\nDeVos' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Under the CARES Act, schools are allocated money according to the proportion of enrolled students receiving Pell Grants, a federal subsidy program for post-high-school students. Ben Miller, an education specialist at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, applied the CARES Act formula to Pell Grant and enrollment data to come up with an estimate of the share of funding available for each of the colleges. He estimates for profit schools will receive $1 billion in stimulus money. Charlie Eaton, a University of California, Merced sociologist, separately helped MarketWatch compare this list to U.S. Department of Education data and other information highlighting problems for-profit institutions that are eligible for funds. The funding is intended to support schools as they shift classes online, and for grants to students for food, housing, equipment and other needs.\n\nThe analysis found that of the top estimated 100 for-profit schools eligible for coronavirus crisis subsidies, 79 had students who demanded their loans be forgiven under a federal program meant to provide relief to students who alleged they had been defrauded. From these top 100 for-profit schools, 12,000 students had filed federal complaints alleging they were victims of fraud. Twenty-three of the top 100 for-profit schools most likely to receive funding were previously characterized by federal regulators as \"failed\" under a requirement that students go on to find jobs good enough to repay loans. DeVos last year rescinded the requirement that schools meet this standard as a condition for benefiting from federal subsidies.\n\nTwelve of the top 100 for-profit schools eligible for stimulus funds also faced some form of legal action as of 2017 for alleged fraud involving recruitment and misuse of federal student aid programs, according to the analysis. Thirteen, meanwhile, were under \"heightened cash monitoring,\" an extra level of scrutiny under U.S. Department of Education rules meant to serve as a caution to students that can indicate problems with finances or accreditation.\n\n\"Colleges like these with a predatory history and thousands of prior students who are still awaiting compensation for deceptive practices should not be getting a federal bailout,\" said Bob Shireman, deputy undersecretary of education under President Obama who now oversees higher education programs at The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank.\n\nAs the rushed effort to dispense $2 trillion in stimulus funds unfolds, experts are questioning how the government more broadly will guard against fraud, waste and abuse, and whether the public can trust whether tax dollars will be used to achieve the program's goals.\n\nSome observers say they are concerned about a rerun of the 2008 stimulus package, which proved to be boomtime for the for-profit education sector, but which led to a wave of student loan defaults and congressional inquiries. The 2008 stimulus package included $17 billion to ramp up the Pell Grant program. Some school chains expanded the number of recruitment staff to convince students to apply for federally subsidized grants and loans. For-profit school enrollment tripled between 2000 and 2012, while annual student loan interest payments grew from $13 billion in 2003 to $34 billion in 2012, according to a U.S. Senate report decrying expensive, poor quality instruction in for-profit school chains\n\nThe CARES Act includes some provisions intended to protect students, such as a requirement that half of the grants to schools would go directly to support students, said Tariq Habash, head of investigations at the Student Borrower Protection Center. But the bill leaves wiggle room for schools to continue recruiting aggressively while maximizing revenues.\n\n\"There's no limit on executive compensation, on stock buybacks, even on marketing expenses. There is a potential for abuse there,\" he said.\n\nCareer Education Colleges and Universities, the trade association for for-profit secondary schools, issued a tweet March 26 praising the U.S. Senate for passing the stimulus package. MarketWatch was unable to reach a representative with the trade association for comment.\n\nThe \"Senate passed CARES Act last night 96-0! The bill is one of the largest rescue packages in American history and will provide relief to students during the COVID-19 outbreak,\" the Twitter post said.\n\nFor profit schools have earned a reputation in some circles as innovators, especially in areas such as online learning and flexible class schedules to accommodate working parents.\n\n\"Many for-profit postsecondary education companies have made valuable innovations and other positive contributions to the improvement of U.S. postsecondary education,\" said William Loesch, principal with the law firm Goldberg Kohn Ltd., who has been involved in merger and acquisition deals involving for-profit schools. \"For-profit schools have been innovators in terms of delivering education that is more targeted to the current needs of students. If you are online education, it was for-profits who were the first to pursue that avenue broadly.\"\n\nAmong the for-profit chains eligible for aid in the stimulus package is Eduk Group, a group of trade schools in Puerto Rico and Florida that appears eligible for approximately $35 million in bailout money. According to the most recent available federal data, Instituto de Banca y Comercio, one of Eduk's schools, was under a federal status called \"heightened cash monitoring,\" where schools with problems managing their finances are put on a special watch list that could ultimately make it hard to access federal aid dollars.\n\nEduk did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJeffrey Leeds, founder and managing partner of Eduk Group's owner Leeds Equity Partners, said he was not interested in discussing the firm's new status as a potential top recipient of the federal bailout funds for for-profit schools.\n\n\"We haven't thought about those issues because that ideological debate continues to rage and we don't want to be a part of that,\" he said.\n\nLeeds has been a prolific deal maker in the for-profit education sector. The firm had joined one of the earlier, well-timed deals of the mid 2000s, joining with Providence Equity Partners and Goldman Sachs in 2006 to borrow $2 billion in a $3.4 billion buyout of Education Management Corporation, (EDMC) owner of a law school and four major postsecondary school chains.\n\nThe chain was subject to an undercover investigation by the Government Accountability Office, whose results were presented during 2010 congressional hearings. It also became subject to a U.S. Senate Investigation, fraud probes by 11 states and the District of Columbia, and a federal whistleblower lawsuit.\n\nEDMC was \"operating essentially as a recruitment mill,\" said U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, in announcing a $95.5 Million settlement that also included forgiveness of $100 million in student loans. EDMC didn't admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. EDMC President and CEO Mark McEachen said in a statement at the time, \"Though we continue to believe the allegations in the cases were without merit, putting these matters behind us returns our focus to educating students.\"\n\nEDMC filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation in June 2018. But Education Department data shows remnants of the EDMC chain appear as among the top school groups eligible for stimulus funds.\n\nAnother for-profit college chain Education Affiliates is potentially eligible for the third largest estimated stimulus sum of $33 million. In 2015 the firm settled a whistleblower lawsuit with the U.S. Department of Justice following allegations that school recruitment staff helped students fake admission test scores, obtain bogus high school diplomas, and submit fraudulent applications for financial aid. The $13 million settlement followed allegations of \"predatory conduct that victimized students and bilked taxpayers,\" education undersecretary Ted Mitchell said in a statement.\n\nEducation Affiliates said at the time that it did not admit to any wrongdoing. Education Affiliates did not respond to requests for comment for this article\n\nConcerns about for-profit school chains during the past decade led to a broader Obama-era crackdown that included enforcement actions, the enactment of policies and rules designed to protect student borrowers, and the shuttering of some for-profit chains.\n\nWhile this period saw a decline in the business prospects of for-profit colleges, analysts say a turnaround is possible. DeVos has blunted or abandoned Obama-era policies meant to curtail excesses of for-profit schools. And typically when the economy slows down some people who are unemployed go back to school, suggesting another boomtime.\n\nBut we're in no ordinary slowdown, said Robert Lytle, who heads the education team in Ernst & Young Global Limited's strategic consulting affiliate EY Parthenon. People are likely to remain in shock for a while before making any major economic decisions such as paying for a new degree, he said.\n\n\"This particular recession is outside the boundaries of anybody's planning. But net, net, being in the education delivery business, or somebody who sells goods and services to the education system has been a more comfortable place to be than the other sectors,\" he said.",

The coronavirus has laid bare the unintended consequences of globalization -- the vulnerability of just-in-time global supply chains lacking suitable redundancies and the pauperacy of conventional monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nAs COVID-19 extended the New Year holiday for Chinese manufacturing and the virus spread to the industrialized north of Italy, production was selectively disrupted by shortages of components made by only one supplier or in one region.\n\nAs the virus spread to America and businesses dialed down or shut altogether, investors panicked and stocks slid into bear-market territory, because they could not gauge the arch of the pandemic, how effectively the president, governors and leaders elsewhere could address it, and how long the economy would operate at reduced speed.\n\nFederal Reserve interest-rate cuts could do nothing to ensure imports from China and other places resumed or halt the spread of COVID-19 in America.\n\nWith many restaurants, schools, factories and retailers closed and heathy folks working from home and not traveling, what began as a supply-side crisis -- a shortage of parts and components from China, Italy and other sources -- morphed into a Keynesian recession -- consumers are not spending. Not necessarily because they don't want to spend but often because they can't.\n\nWhile some businesses are experiencing surges -- medical supply manufacturers and Walmart WMT, +0.70% from panic buying for household supplies -- many more are laying off workers.\n\nUnite Here represents 300,000 employees in hospitality, restaurants, airports and other industries. It estimates . State unemployment offices have seen\n\nBusinesses facing declining sales and losses became desperate to fortify cash balances and ran down lines of credit. They sold Treasuries and other securities usually held for liquidity. That cratered stocks SPX, -1.51%, bond TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.656% and commodity markets CL00, -3.63% -- and pressured lending limits of banks and threatened money-market funds, which also provide short-term credit to businesses.\n\nto shore up banks and money-market funds, and support markets for state and municipal bonds and consumer credit. And the Fed rolled out new tools to create facilities that will offer loans directly to corporations and small businesses with new capital supplied by Treasury.\n\nFed and Treasury credits cannot replace lost sales to business, and whatever loans they extend will add to debt burdens in thin-margin industries. Massive fiscal stimulus is needed to save the real economy.\n\nWith the arch of the pandemic uncertain, economists are challenged to estimate the impact on the economy. Morgan Stanley expects unemployment to jump to 13% in the second quarter and the St. Louis Federal Reserve estimates 30%. Coupled with lost productivity from reduced hours and awkward work at home situations, a jump in unemployment to 20% by this summer could cost $4 trillion to $5 trillion.\n\nSeen in this context, -- including direct payments to individuals, enhanced unemployment benefits, and assistance to small businesses and heavily impacted industries like airlines -- may prove hardly enough. If the virus does not peak by May, the economic contraction will deepen to levels not seen since the Great Depression.\n\nLoans that become grants if businesses maintain employment near pre-crisis levels are helpful but as the virus subsides and stores reopen, consumer habits will have changed. And and to those who need it in sufficient amounts and millions of permanently lost jobs.\n\nTreasury foresees mailing out checks to individuals . That will challenge the IRS and be much delayed, because Congress is scaling payments according to family incomes and size. Much of the aid to businesses is subject to time-consuming, uncertain and unrealistic conditions to maintain employment and cap salaries.\n\nExpanded unemployment benefits, though attractive on equity grounds, will be paid out over several months but will not give the economy the large, quick jolt that loading all the aid to individuals into quicker direct payments could provide.\n\nCongress should consider another round of stimulus -- checks for $1,200 to virtually every American every month through September. Otherwise, another Great Depression is in the offing because of the lack of a large enough immediate action.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"},

But at the same time, hiring is ramping up in some industries.\n\nSome 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits two weeks ago -- the As more Americans practice social distancing to contain the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, layoffs are hitting sectors that rely on foot traffic, such as brick-and-mortar retail, hospitality, and restaurants and bars.\n\nOn top of which, the U.S. lost some , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday. (The government added 17,000 U.S. Census workers, partly scaling back the decline in employment.)\n\nBut the good news is that layoffs aren't happening across the board. In fact, a wave of unprecedented demand in certain sectors is sending some employers on hiring sprees.\n\nWalmart Inc. WMT, -3.23% said last month it plans to hire 150,000 new workers. The retailer also said it would give full-time employees who are paid hourly a bonus of $300 each, and part-time hourly employees a bonus of $150 on April 2, . The Walmart jobs will be temporary at first, but many will convert to permanent roles over time, the company said.\n\nSince the company's March 19 announcement, Walmart has hired approximately 5,000 new associates each day, a spokeswoman told MarketWatch.\n\nAlso read:\n\nAmazon AMZN, +0.70% announced plans to hire 100,000 new employees to handle as more Americans stay home.\n\nThe openings are across the U.S. in fulfillment centers, transportation operations, Amazon Go Stores, Whole Foods stores, and in deliveries. \"While most of the hires will stay with the company through at least April, we do anticipate there will be opportunities to stay with Amazon in a longer temporary or permanent role,\" an Amazon spokeswoman said.\n\nThe company said they have already managed to hire 80,000 people for those roles as of April 2.\n\nAmazon also began doing worker each day in select U.S. sites on Sunday, March 29.\n\nBeyond Amazon and Walmart, here are the companies and sectors that are ramping up hiring:\n\nFood and convenience stores\n\nAs Americans flock to grocery stores to maintain their shelves are being stripped clean. In order to restock them in a timely manner grocery chains including Albertsons Cos., Kroger KR, -2.36% and Trader Joe's have either increased hiring or offered bonuses to employees.\n\n\"This will provide job opportunities and ensure 7-Eleven stores remain clean and in-stock with the goods our customers need during this critical time,\" said 7-Eleven president and CEO, Joe DePinto. The company anticipates that the majority of the new hires will be used to fulfill orders on 7NOW, an on-demand delivery app.\n\nAlbertsons Cos., a national grocery chain which owns Safeway and Acme, \"is immediately hiring 30,000 new associates,\" the company announced late last month.\n\n(Lowe's, 7-Eleven and Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment on how many of those positions have since been filled).\n\nKroger is hiring 20,000 new associates nationwide across retail stores, manufacturing plants and distribution centers, . Last month, Kroger announced plans to hire 10,000 new workers, but ended up hiring a total of 23,500 workers, Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokeswoman said on Friday. Kroger's average hourly wage is $15 an hour, she said.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Kroger has hired 30,600 new employees, Howard told MarketWatch last week.\n\nTrader Joe's is paying bonuses to store employees amid an \"unprecedented increase\" in sales due to the coronavirus pandemic, The company did not respond to request for comment on whether they are also increasing hiring and how much they are paying employees in bonuses.\n\nHome improvement stores\n\nHome improvement stores have remained open in most states. Like grocery stores, they are considered essential businesses.\n\nTractor Supply Co. TSCO, -1.67% said Monday that it will hire across its 1,900 stores which cater to ranchers and farmers, the company's largest hiring drive.\n\n\"Our focus is to bring people in as permanent employees,\" Mary Winn Pilkington, senior vice president of investor relations and public relations at Tractor Supply Co. The majority of the new hires will be filling customer service roles and safety roles, she added.\n\nSome 5,300 Ace Hardware stores have remained open across the country. In response to heightened demand for home supplies, the retailer-owned hardware cooperative said last week that it is looking to hire 30,000 new full-time, part-time and seasonal workers.\n\nLowe's LOW, +2.46% stores have also remained open to ensure customers have access to essential appliances like refrigerators and freezers in addition to cleaning products. The company announced late last month that it is openings at distribution centers and in-stores.\n\nDelivery services\n\nBecause more consumers are shopping online and there is a need for more drivers and remote workers to coordinate delivery logistics, Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao said.\n\nThat sector has grown the fastest over the past month, Zhao said, according to Glassdoor hiring data. Most of the job openings are for truck and delivery drivers as well as warehouse workers, he said.\n\nWhile these types of jobs may be less appealing to people who are trying to limit face-to-face contact with others, there are also a variety of supply chain analysis jobs and delivery dispatch jobs that can be done remotely.\n\n\"Obviously there is high demand in health care,\" Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, a New York-based fixed income securities brokerage firm, said. \"But that isn't something anyone off the street can do.\" Stanley predicts restaurant workers will take on delivery roles.\n\nCVS Health CVS, +1.15% plans to add 50,000 full-time, part-time and temporary workers, the company said. It has decided to tap directly into its customers' workforces by . The company recently waived home delivery fees for prescriptions and said it is looking to hire more drivers.\n\nThe company has hired 5,000 people, a CVS spokesman, said. \"Many of these roles are at the retail level and in our distribution centers,\" he added.\n\nPopular pizza chains in the U.S. are also experiencing a spike in demand as many restaurants and quick-service chains have shifted to takeout, delivery, drive-thru and pick-up only.\n\nPizza Hut is looking to fill 30,000 permanent job openings, Yum Brands Inc. YUM, +1.20%, its parent company, . As families eat more meals together, Pizza Hut says it has seen an increase in demand for its Big Dipper pizza, which offers two feet of pizza and 24 slices.\n\nPapa John's International Inc. PZZA, -0.79% also announced last month it's aiming to hire 20,000 workers with an immediate start date. Domino's Pizza Inc. DPZ, -1.34% says that it's looking for full-time and part-time workers in a .\n\nHungry Howie's, a Detroit-based pizza chain with 550 locations in 21 states, has 2,000 permanent delivery driver openings, the company said last month. Drivers can make up to $15 an hour, a company spokeswoman told MarketWatch.\n\nBlue Apron APRN, +0.08%, a meal kit service that delivers to homes, also announced that it is increasing capacity and hiring workers .\n\nInternet and telecommunications\n\nWhile millions of American workers, many are doing so -- 38 states now have orders in place keeping residents mostly at home.\n\nIn order to communicate virtually over platforms like Slack WORK, -3.41%, Zoom ZM, -7.47% and Google GOOG, -0.03% GOOGL, -0.05% Hangouts, high-speed reliable internet is an absolute must.\n\nDane Jasper, CEO of Sonic, a Northern California-based internet and telecommunications provider serving more than 100,000 customers, said his company has experienced a record surge in new customers. To meet the increased demand, he will likely be hiring an additional 15 employees a month to join his team of 520 employees, he said.\n\n\"With so many folks engaging in social distancing and distance learning, unlike many industries we are busier than ever before,\" Jasper said. Employees of Sonic, like other telecommunication companies, are allowed to travel freely through regions that have shelter-in-place orders because their services are deemed essential, especial for emergency communication purposes, Jasper said.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIncreased demand in the U.S. for respiratory equipment such as ventilators could cause a surge in hiring in manufacturing.\n\n\"At some point certain manufacturers will want to increase hiring so that they can make more ventilators,\" said Stanley of Amherst Pierpont. \"It's almost like a wartime operation,\" he added. In addition to hospital beds and health professionals, there may be a ventilator shortage. The breathing machines are critical to saving the lives of patients with severe coronaviruses cases.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced that he was , to require General Motors GM, +8.95% to make ventilators for hospitals to help patients with COVID-19. The order requires GM to \"accept, perform, and prioritize Federal contracts for ventilators.\"\n\nFord Motor Co. F, +3.97% also said they are \"exploring\" making ventilators amid fears the life-saving devices might become scarce in the U.S., MarketWatch .\n\nThis story was updated on April 6, 2020.", "source":

Grimm, a career government manager who took over the position early this year in an interim capacity. \"When was she appointed?\" Trump asked.\n\nTrump's comments carried an edge because last Friday he announced the firing of the inspector general of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, for reporting to Congress the whistleblower complaint that the president tried to enlist Ukraine in investigating Joe Biden's son.\n\nGrimm's title is principal deputy inspector general. She began her career with the agency more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe HHS inspector general's report was based on a telephone survey of 323 hospitals around the country, from March 23-27. With hundreds of new coronavirus cases daily, the situation is becoming more dire for many the nation's 6,000 hospitals.\n\nTrump maintains that virus testing has been a success story for his administration. Although testing is now ramping up, it's been a major source of complaints for weeks.\n\nThe inspector general's report warned that hospitals' problems are feeding off each other in a vicious cycle. That includes insufficient tests, slow results, scarcity of protective gear, the shortage of breathing machines for seriously ill patients and burned-out staffs anxious for their own safety.\n\n\"There's this sort of domino effect,\" said Ann Maxwell, an assistant inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services. \"These challenges play off each other and exacerbate the situation. There's a cascade effect.\"\n\n\"Hospitals reported that their most significant challenges centered on testing and caring for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, and keeping staff safe,\" the report concluded.\n\n\"It's likely that every hospital in America is going to have to deal with this,\" Maxwell said.\n\nIn most people, the coronavirus causes mild to moderate symptoms. Others, particularly older people and those with underlying health issues, can develop life-threatening breathing problems. The U.S. has more diagnosed cases in the global pandemic than any other country, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Projections show the nation will see the peak impact later this month.\n\nA key insight from the report was that different problems -- usually addressed individually -- are building on each other to entangle the whole system.\n\nFor example, a lack of testing and slow results means hospitals must keep patients with unconfirmed coronavirus disease longer.\n\nThat takes up precious beds and uses up protective equipment like gowns, masks and face shields, since doctors and nurses have to assume that patients with symptoms of respiratory distress may be positive.\n\nThe increased workload raises the stress on clinical staff, who are also concerned they may be unable to properly protect themselves.\n\n\"Health care workers feel like they're at war right now,\" a hospital administrator in New York City told the inspector general's investigators. They \"are seeing people in their 30s, 40s, 50s dying. ... This takes a large emotional toll.\" The inspector general's office did not identify survey respondents due to privacy concerns.\n\nOvertime hours and increased use of supplies are raising costs at the same time that many hospitals experience a revenue crunch because elective surgeries have been canceled. The recently passed federal stimulus bill pumps money to hospitals.\n\nOf the 323 hospitals in the survey, 117 reported they were treating one or more patients with confirmed COVID-19, while 130 said they were treating one or more patients suspected to have the disease. Suspected infections are treated similarly, because of the uncertainties around testing. Only 32 hospitals said they were not treating any patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Another 44 hospitals did not provide that information.\n\n\"Hospitals anticipated being overwhelmed by a surge in COVID-19 patients, who would need specialty beds and isolation areas for effective treatment,\" the report said.\n\nTrade groups representing hospitals Monday welcomed the report but said that even more problems are emerging in the care of COVID-19 patients.\n\nParts of Europe provide a glimpse of what hospitals in the U.S. are trying to avoid. The AP reported last week that some European nations are throwing together makeshift hospitals and shipping coronavirus patients out of overwhelmed cities via high-speed trains and military jets. In Spain, doctors are having to make agonizing decisions about who gets the best care. In the U.S., two Navy hospital ships have been deployed and field hospitals erected.\n\nHow to set priorities for the use of ventilators, breathing machines that can sustain life, is one of the most worrisome questions. Hospitals from Louisiana to New York and Michigan are already confronting projected shortages, The Associated Press reported last week.\n\n\"Government needs to provide guidelines on ethics if health resources are limited and decisions need to be made about which patients to treat,\" a hospital official in Broward County, Florida, told the inspector general's office. \"Are physicians liable for their decisions if that happens?\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@marketwatch.com", "name": "Associated

Here's how to make sure you get yours", "body": "The IRS is launching a tracker for the 'economic impact payments' of up to $1,200 that it's sending to most Americans\n\nChecks for millions of Americans, a key part of the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill, will start rolling out as early as next week.\n\nThat money can't come soon enough for the more thanwho are suddenly out of a job, and everyone else who's about how to pay their bills, and withstand the coronavirus' economic onslaught.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will send with adjusted gross income below $75,000 and $2,400 to married couples filing taxes jointly who earn under $150,000. The government will also pay $500 per qualifying child.\n\nThe payouts -- formally dubbed \"economic impact payments\" -- decline above the $75,000/$150,000 threshold and end at $99,000 for indviduals and $198,000 for married couples.\n\nThe money will appear automatically in your bank account if the IRS has your account information on file from previous years' tax returns. If the IRS doesn't already have your account information, or if you didn't file taxes in 2018 or 2019, you can .\n\n\"Economic Impact Payments will be distributed automatically to most people starting next week,\" the IRS said Friday. The agency said it would launch a tracking tool called \"Get My Payment\" by April 17. The tool will give people an idea on when they can expect a deposit or a check in the mail, the IRS said.\n\nThe IRS announcement Friday didn't get into specifics on its timeline to cut checks, but here's an estimated timetable, according to federal lawmakers, as of last week.\n\n* The IRS is planning to send a first wave for the week that starts April 13, according to an expected timeline\n\nThe tax authority will transmit 60 million payments via direct deposit, using the banking information it has on file for taxpayers' 2018 or 2019 tax returns, the timetable said.\n\nThat wave will include Social Security recipients who filed tax returns and included direct deposit information on their returns, according to the House Ways and Means' estimated timeline.\n\n* The second wave will go to Social Security recipients who did not file 2018 or 2019 returns and receive their benefits through direct deposit.\n\n* In early May, the IRS will start mailing paper checks to households, at a rate of 5 million per week. The paper checks will first go to the households with the lowest adjusted gross incomes, and continue upwards.\n\nIt could take up to 20 weeks to mail out all those checks, according to the House Ways and Means' timetable.\n\nThe stimulus bill devotes $290 billion to the direct payments. The average payment will be $1,523 per household, according to calculations from, a right-leaning think tank.\n\nIt's important the remember people are still eligible to receive a stimulus check even if they haven't filed taxes. Someone might not file federal taxes if they make too little money to report. For example, single filers earning below $12,200 last year, and married couples earning $24,400.\n\nThe payments will go to anyone who is a U.S. citizen or resident alien who has a valid Social Security number, could not be claimed as a dependent of another taxpayer, and meets the income requirements.\n\nPeople who haven't filed taxes can submit their bank account information to register for the payments. The link can be\n\nAs checks are about to hit accounts, law enforcement officials\n\nThe IRS will never call, text, email or reach out to consumer via social media to say it needs more information to process a payment. The same goes for banks and credit unions.

Gavin Newsom made the announcement on Rachel Maddow's MSNBC show Tuesday night. On Wednesday, Newsom announced the state had its largest daily increase of COVID-19 deaths with 68.\n\n\"As a nation-state with a capacity to write a check for hundreds of millions -- no, billions of dollars -- we are in a position to do something bold and big that could be a catalyst to increase supply,\" Newsom said.\n\nState officials have signed a contract with BYD North America to deliver the masks, chosen in part because it is a subsidiary of a company based in China, where much of the personal protective gear is made.\n\nThe order will include about 150 million N95 masks, which are tight-fitting and designed to protect against particles in the air. The other 50 million masks will be surgical masks, which are loose-fitting and protect against fluids.\n\nCalifornia taxpayers will pay $495 million upfront for the masks. The state will pay more as other shipments arrive, with a total estimated payment of $990 million, according to a letter the Newsom administration sent to the Legislature.\n\nThe money comes from a portion of the $1 billion aid package the Legislature approved last month, plus another $1.3 billion disaster response emergency fund that Newsom has the authority to spend.\n\nNewsom signed an executive order on Tuesday eliminating sales and other taxes on masks, gloves, eye protection, gowns and other materials. It applies to such materials when they are sold to or purchased by the state.\n\nCalifornia has already ordered $1.4 billion worth of personal protective equipment and distributed 41.4 million N95 masks. But the state has had trouble finding enough masks to meet the needs of its nearly 40 million residents. One shipment from Texas had to be sent back because the masks carried mold, Newsom said.\n\nThe state also plans to start cleaning masks so health workers can re-use them by partnering with Battelle, an Ohio-based company that says it can clean up to 80,000 masks per day. The masks can be used up to 20 times each, Newsom said.\n\n\"We're already working with hospital system to create the the protocols so they are not throwing all these masks out,\" Newsom said.\n\nIn Santa Clara County, where the U.S. had one of its first confirmed COVID-19 cases, public health officials are so worried about a shortage of protective gear that they have ordered businesses and individuals to tell the government if they have stockpiles of more than 5,000 gloves and 500 masks. The government promised to keep the figures confidential.\n\n\"We can't rely solely on our state and federal government. We have to turn locally to see what capacity for inventory exists here in our county,\" said Dr. Jennifer Tong, hospital surge capacity branch chief for the Santa Clara County Emergency Operations Center.\n\nLikewise, Newsom said the state can't rely on the federal government, which has sent the state about a million masks so far.\n\n\"That's not an indictment, not a cheap shot. At the end of the day, they don't have the masks at the national stockpile,\" Newsom said on MSNBC.\n\nCalifornia has more than 17,800 COVID-19 cases and has seen more than 450 deaths, according to data complied by Johns Hopkins University. Intensive care hospitalizations have been growing at a slower rate than experts had anticipated, leading Newsom to donate 500 ventilators to other states.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news",

In March, the foundation announced a $125 million effort to identify and develop treatments for Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\nPopular stories on WSJ.com", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_calfas@marketwatch.com", "name": "Jennifer Calfas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_&_Melinda_Gates_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Research_Funding", "label": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Research Funding", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-HL142_Gates_ZG_20190610165211.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1854}, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 1854, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6027903384", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-10", "time": "21:01:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-10T21:01:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-10T21:01:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/16-million-people-just-got-laid-off-but-us-stocks-had-their-best-week-in-45-years-2020-04-10-1710307", "title": "16 million people just got laid off but U.S. stocks had their best week in 45 years", "body": "How can these two things - double-digit unemployment and double-digit stock gains - be true at the same time?\n\nWhen are stimulus checks being sent out?

And for now, the unprecedented actions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks are helping keep investors numb.\n\n\"Stocks are up because the damage to the economy -- evident in claims -- is beyond comprehension, while the response of the Fed is easier to understand,\" wrote Chris Low, chief economist for FHN Financial, in a note out Thursday after the jobless claims data.\n\nAnd most strategists think stocks are likely to take a leg lower from here. ,\" Kim Forrest, founder and CIO of Bokeh Capital Management, told MarketWatch. .\n\nStill, there may be some historical context for understanding what's going on.\n\nIn an analysis published Thursday, investor Ned Davis notes that the stock market does better than average when unemployment spikes. Davis' research shows that a jobless rate over 6% correlates with the stock market rising 13.7% per annum.\n\n\"How can this be?\" Davis wrote. \"It defies logic. My explanation would be that this news is widely followed, and the market tends to look ahead. So it is probably priced in.\"\n\nIt's also probably in large part because of the central bank's punchbowl, Davis added. Very high unemployment \"can send the Fed into overdrive in terms of making money cheaper and more easily available... When the Fed helps investment grade bond yields plunge, it has been a good buy signal for stocks.\"\n\nThe and some limited support for sub-investment grade debt.\n\nRelated:\n\nNicholas Colas, co-founder of investment research shop DataTrek Research, also had some thoughts on the link between the real economy and markets, in an analysis released Friday. \"The issuance of money sits at the intersection of public trust and government responsibility,\" Colas wrote.\n\n\"It is tempting to think that the Fed's actions today means US stock prices will only trend higher from here: When you remove near term bankruptcy risk from every publicly held company regardless of credit rating or near-term financial condition, asset prices should rise,\" Colas added. \"Markets know that no matter how bad cash flow might be there is a Fed loan backstop waiting in the wings if needed.\"\n\nWhat's more, he said, \"The Fed knows it must keep equity markets stable to rising in order to keep the 40% of Americans who own stocks sufficiently liquid and confident to spark a recovery in consumer spending. This is the classic wealth effect, something the Federal Reserve understands well.\"\n\nIt's worth pointing out that if 40% of Americans own stocks, 60% do not. And not only are those people not sparking a trickle-down recovery, they may be .\n\nSee:", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_riquier@marketwatch.com", "name": "Andrea Riquier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ned Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarketWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MarketWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Congress of Industrial Organizations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wealth effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-IE205_spx_se_ZG_20200410085613.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1744, "pinterest": 10}, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 1754, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "6023967565", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-07", "time": "20:24:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-07T20:24:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-07T20:24:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/traffic-at-walmart-costco-and-target-falls-for-the-first-time-in-weeks-as-coronavirus-stockpiling-behavior-shifts-2020-03-31", "title": "Traffic at Walmart, Costco and Target falls for the first time in weeks as coronavirus stockpiling behavior shifts", "body": "Shopper traffic could climb again, though social distancing and e-commerce may keep consumers away from stores\n\nTraffic at Walmart Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Target Corp. dropped for the first time in the weeks since the coronavirus pandemic ramped up in the U.S., according to Placer.ai.\n\nWalmart WMT, -3.23% traffic was down 6.7% year-over-year for the third week of March.

Morgan", "body": "The current shock originated in the consumer sector, which accounts for 70% of GDP\n\nThere is a widespread view on Wall Street that the stock market hit its lowest level of the bear market last month, and that a combination of an ebbing of the coronavirus in late spring and unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus will set the stage for a sharp rebound in corporate profits later this year.\n\nHowever, Mislav Matejka, head of global equity strategy at J.P. Morgan warned investors in a research note this week that there is a significant chance the global economy experiences \"a vicious spiral, which is typical of recessions, between weak final demand, weaker labor markets, falling profits, weak credits markets and low oil prices.\"\n\nWhat's particularly troubling to Matejka is that the current recession has been triggered by a shock to the consumer -- which makes up 70% of GDP in Western economies -- as workers around the globe are prevented from earning a living by the closures of nonessential business. This dynamic has led J.P. Morgan economists to predict \"only a gradual bottoming out in activity, such as seen after the Great Financial Crisis, and not a V-shaped one that we see, for example, after natural disasters.\" A so-called V-shaped economic recession is typically defined as one characterized by a sharp, but brief, slowdown in business activity that is followed by a powerful rebound.\n\nThe bank's house view is that the unemployment rate will remain elevated at 8.5% during the second of the year, while the peak-to-trough decline in real U.S. GDP will be 10%, versus the 4% decline during the financial crisis. \"And this is all assuming that the virus is history by June, which might prove significantly optimistic,\" Matejka wrote.\n\nTherefore, he advised clients to ignore technical signals indicating stocks are oversold, or to be reassured by the massive fiscal and monetary support provided by global governments. To do so would be \"missing the elephant in the room, that is the first consumer and labor market downcycle in 11 years.\"\n\n\"While consensus view still appears to be a quick recovery, recessions tend to linger,\" Matejka added. \"It took equities on average 18 months to record the final low in the past.\"\n\nEconomic data thus far show the beginnings of a negative feedback loop, he argued, where lower consumer spending leads to lower corporate profits, lower corporate investment, more job losses and further declines in consumer spending. This cycle can continue even when the reason for initial weakness has been removed, he said.\n\n\"Here though, we worry about a Catch-22: the pace of consumer recovery in China is very slow, which could push economic forecasts of a recovery further out,\" Matejka added. \"On the other hand, the risk of a second wave of infections rises\" if economic activity recovers too quickly.\n\nThis is why J.P. Morgan strategists are closely watching the situation in China and South Korea. An absence of reaccleration of cases in those places is a necessary condition for a bottoming in stocks in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, Matejka advises clients to wait for the coming revision of earnings forecasts.

This dynamic has led J.P. Morgan economists to predict \"only a gradual bottoming out in activity, such as seen after the Great Financial Crisis, and not a V-shaped one that we see, for example, after natural disasters.\" A so-called V-shaped economic recession is typically defined as one characterized by a sharp, but brief, slowdown in business activity that is followed by a powerful rebound.\n\nThe bank's house view is that the unemployment rate will remain elevated at 8.5% during the second of the year, while the peak-to-trough decline in real U.S. GDP will be 10%, versus the 4% decline during the financial crisis. \"And this is all assuming that the virus is history by June, which might prove significantly optimistic,\" Matejka wrote.\n\nTherefore, he advised clients to ignore technical signals indicating stocks are oversold, or to be reassured by the massive fiscal and monetary support provided by global governments. To do so would be \"missing the elephant in the room, that is the first consumer and labor market downcycle in 11 years.\"\n\n\"While consensus view still appears to be a quick recovery, recessions tend to linger,\" Matejka added. \"It took equities on average 18 months to record the final low in the past.\"\n\nEconomic data thus far show the beginnings of a negative feedback loop, he argued, where lower consumer spending leads to lower corporate profits, lower corporate investment, more job losses and further declines in consumer spending.

And that has been felt across all income brackets, with almost as many families earning more than $100,000 a year claiming their income has taken a hit (71%) as the those making less than $50,000 (74%).\n\nOf course, the households earning less than $50,000 were also much more likely to say that their income was hit \"very significantly\" (29%) compared to those making more than $100,000 (19%).\n\nThe FT survey also noticed a partisan split over fears about the lasting effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. Republicans were more likely to be concerned about the economic impact compared to Democrats (45% vs. 22%), while Democrats were more worried about the public health impact over the financial fallout (78% vs. 55%).\n\nBut more help is on the way for American workers.\n\nLawmakers in Washington, D.C. are working on a \"Phase 4\" $1 trillion bipartisan stimulus package , which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said will \"extend and expand\" the CARES Act (also known as the ) to assist small businesses, strengthen unemployment benefits and give families additional direct payments.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_lyn_pesce@marketwatch.com", "name": "Nicole Lyn Pesce", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Software", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Software", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Education and Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-IE060_overdu_ZG_20200408125606.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1120}, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 1120, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6026586363", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-09", "time": "19:15:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-09T19:15:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-09T18:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-will-revisit-their-coronavirus-crash-low-and-heres-when-to-expect-it-2020-04-09", "title": "Stocks will revisit their coronavirus crash low, and here's when to expect it", "body": "Is the great coronavirus bear market of 2020 now history? Many exuberant bulls would have you believe that it is, since the S&P 500 SPX, +1.44% is now more than 20% higher than its mid-March low. That satisfies the semi-official definition of a bull market.\n\nSo in that narrow sense, the bulls are right. But in a broader sense, I consider their arguments to be a triumph of hope over experience. If by definition we're in a new bull market, the question we should be asking is different: Will the stock market hit a new low later this year, lower than where it stood at the March low?\n\nI'm convinced the answer is \"yes.\" My study of past bear markets revealed a number of themes, each of which points to the .\n\nWhile the market's rally since its March 23 low has been explosive, it's not unprecedented. Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.22% was created in the late 1800s, there have been 38 other occasions where it rallied just as much (or more) in just as short a period -- and all of them occurred during the Great Depression.\n\nSuch ominous parallels are a powerful reminder that the market can explode upward during the context of a devastating long-term decline. Consider the bull- and bear-market calendar maintained by Ned Davis Research. According to it, there were no fewer than six bull markets between the 1929 stock market crash and the end of the 1930s. I doubt an investor interviewed in 1939 about his experience of the Great Depression would have highlighted those bull markets.\n\nAnother way of making the same point is to measure the number of days between the end of the bear market's first leg down and its eventual end. There are 11 bear markets in the Ned Davis calendar in which the Dow fell by more than the 37.1% loss it incurred between its February 2020 high to its March low. On average across those 11, as you can see from the chart below, the final bear market low came 137 days after first registering such a loss. If we add that average to the day of the March low, we come up with a projected low on Aug. 7.\n\nMore bearishness needed\n\nSentiment also points to a lower low for the U.S. market. That's because the usual pattern is for the final bear-market bottom to be accompanied by thoroughgoing pessimism and despair. That's not what we've seen over the last couple of weeks. In fact, just the opposite is evident -- eagerness to declare that .\n\nAnother way of putting this: When the bear market does finally hit its low, you are unlikely to even be asking whether the bear has breathed his last. You're more likely at that point to have given up on equities altogether, throwing in the towel and cautioning anyone who would listen that any rally attempt is nothing but a bear-market trap to lure gullible bulls.\n\nI compared sentiment during the recent bear market to that of other bear markets of the past 40 years in a . For the most part, the market timers I monitor were more scared at the lows of those prior bear markets than they have been recently. That's very revealing.\n\nVolatility offers clues\n\nA similar conclusion is reached when we focus on the CBOE's Volatility Index, or VIX VIX, -3.87% . An analysis of all bear markets since 1990 shows that the VIX almost always hits its high well before the bear market registers its final low. The only two exceptions came after the 9-11 terrorist attacks and at the end of the two-month bear market in 1998 that accompanied the bankruptcy of Long Term Capital Management. In those two cases, the VIX's high came on the same day of the bear market's low.\n\nOther than those two exceptions, the average lead time of the VIX's peak to the bear market low was 90 days. Add that to the day on which the VIX hit its peak (Mar. 16) and you get a projected low on Jun. 14.\n\nOne way of summing up these historical precedents: We should expect a retest of the market's March low. In fact, according to an analysis conducted by Ned Davis Research, 70% of the time over the past century the Dow has broken below the lows hit at the bottom of any waterfall decline.\n\nRead:\n\nPlus:\n\nIn truth, there's no universal definition of a \"waterfall decline.\" The authors of the Ned Davis study, Ed Clissold, Chief U.S. Strategist, and Thanh Nguyen, Senior Quantitative Analyst, defined it as \"persistent selling over multiple weeks, no more than two up days in a row, a surge in volume, and a collapse in investor confidence.\" That certainly seems reasonable, and the market's free-fall from its February high to its March low surely satisfies these criteria.\n\nUpon studying past declines that also satisfied these criteria, the analysts wrote: \"The temptation [at the end of a waterfall decline] is to breathe a sigh of relief that the waterfall is over and jump back into the market. History suggests that a more likely scenario is a basing and testing period that includes a breaching of the waterfall lows.\"\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
