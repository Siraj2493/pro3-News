Only one - located in Wuhan that just happens to be the epicenter of the epidemic\n\nAt an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future.\n\nA national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place \"to protect the people's health,\" Xi said, because lab safety is a \"national security\" issue.\n\nXi didn't actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swathes of China had escaped from one of the country's bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive entitled: \"Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.\"\n\nRead that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn't it? And just how many \"microbiology labs\" are there in China that handle \"advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus\"?\n\nIt turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the epicenter of the epidemic.\n\nThat's right. China's only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nWhat's more, the People's Liberation Army's top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.\n\nAccording to the PLA Daily, Gen. Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.\n\nDoes that suggest to you that the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, may have escaped from that very lab, and that Gen. Chen's job is to try and put the genie back in the bottle, as it were? It does to me.\n\nAdd to this China's history of similar incidents. Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped -- twice -- from the Beijing lab where it was -- and probably is -- being used in experiments. Both \"man-made\" epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.\n\nAnd then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them.\n\nYou heard me right.\n\nInstead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone's stomach.\n\nAlso fueling suspicions about SARS-CoV-2's origins is the series of increasingly lame excuses offered by the Chinese authorities as people began to sicken and die.\n\nThey first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus.\n\nI don't buy any of this. It turns out that snakes don't carry coronaviruses and that bats aren't sold at a seafood market. Neither are pangolins, for that matter, an endangered species valued for their scales as much as for their meat.\n\nThe evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens.\n\nChina has unleashed a plague on its own people. It's too early to say how many in China and other countries will ultimately die for the failures of their country's state-run microbiology labs, but the human cost will be high.\n\nBut not to worry. Xi has assured us that he is controlling biosecurity risks \"to protect the people's health.\" PLA bioweapons experts are in charge.\n\nI doubt the Chinese people will find that very reassuring. Neither should we.\n\nSteven W.

But I argued that financial crises, at least, are more like hurricanes: They are the predictable result of built-up economic and financial vulnerabilities and policy mistakes.\n\nThere are times when we should expect the system to reach a tipping point -- the \"Minsky Moment\" -- when a boom and a bubble turn into a crash and a bust. Such events are not about the \"unknown unknowns\" but rather the \"known unknowns.\"\n\nFinancial markets remain blissfully in denial of the many predictable global crises that could come to a head this year, particularly in the months before the U.S. presidential election. In addition to the increasingly obvious risks associated with climate change, at least four countries want to destabilize the US from within.\n\nBeyond the usual economic and policy risks that most financial analysts worry about, a number of potentially seismic white swans are visible on the horizon this year. Any of them could trigger severe economic, financial, political and geopolitical disturbances unlike anything since the 2008 crisis.\n\nFour powers\n\nFor starters, the United States is locked in an escalating strategic rivalry with at least four implicitly aligned revisionist powers: China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. These countries all have an interest in challenging the U.S.-led global order, and 2020 could be a critical year for them, owing to the U.S. presidential election and the potential change in U.S. global policies that could follow.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the U.S. is trying to contain or even trigger regime change in these four countries through economic sanctions and other means. Similarly, the four revisionists want to undercut American hard and soft power abroad by destabilizing the U.S. from within through asymmetric warfare.\n\nIf the U.S. election descends into partisan rancor, chaos, disputed vote tallies and accusations of \"rigged\" elections, so much the better for America's rivals. A breakdown of the U.S. political system would weaken American power abroad.\n\nMoreover, some countries have a particular interest in removing Trump.\n\nThe acute threat that he poses to the Iranian regime gives it with the U.S. in the coming months -- even if it means risking a full-scale war -- on the chance that the ensuing spike in oil prices CL.1, +0.15% would crash the U.S. stock market DJIA, -0.78% SPX, -1.05% , trigger a recession and sink Trump's re-election prospects.\n\nIf the U.S. election descends into partisan rancor, chaos, disputed vote tallies and accusations of \"rigged\" elections, so much the better for America's rivals. A breakdown of the U.S. political system would weaken American power abroad.\n\nYes, is that the targeted killing of Qassem Soleimani has deterred Iran, but that argument misunderstands the regime's perverse incentives. War between U.S. and Iran is likely this year; the current calm is the one before the proverbial storm.\n\nCold war with China\n\nAs for U.S.-China relations, the recent \"Phase 1\" deal is a temporary Band-aid. over technology, data, investment, currency and finance is already escalating sharply.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has reinforced the position of those in the U.S. arguing for containment, and lent further momentum to the broader trend of\n\nMore immediately, the epidemic is likely to be more severe than currently expected, and the disruption to the Chinese economy will have spillover effects on global supply chains -- including pharma inputs, of which China is a critical supplier -- and business confidence, all of which will likely be.\n\nCaroline Baum:\n\nAlthough the Sino-American cold war is by definition a low-intensity conflict, a sharp escalation is likely this year. To some Chinese leaders, it cannot be a coincidence that their country is simultaneously experiencing a massive swine flu outbreak, a severe bird flu, a coronavirus epidemic, political unrest in Hong Kong, the re-election of Taiwan's pro-independence president, and stepped-up U.S. naval operations in the East and South China Seas.\n\nRegardless of whether China has only itself to blame for some of these crises, the view in Beijing is veering toward the conspiratorial.\n\nCyberwarfare\n\nBut open aggression is not really an option at this point, given the asymmetry of conventional power. China's immediate response to U.S. containment efforts will likely take the form of cyberwarfare.\n\nThere are several obvious targets. Chinese hackers -- and their Russian, North Korean and Iranian counterparts -- could interfere in the U.S. election by flooding Americans with misinformation and deep fakes. With the electorate already so polarized, it is not difficult to imagine armed partisans taking to the streets to challenge the results, leading to serious violence and chaos.\n\nRevisionist powers could also attack the U.S. and Western financial systems -- including the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) platform. Already, European Central Bank President that a cyberattack on European financial markets could cost $645 billion.\n\nAnd security officials have expressed similar concerns about the U.S., where an even wider range of telecommunication infrastructure is potentially vulnerable.\n\nBy next year, the U.S.-China conflict could have escalated from a cold war to a near-hot one.\n\nA Chinese regime and economy severely damaged by the COVID-19 crisis and facing restless masses , and will likely set its sights on Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and U.S. naval positions in the East and South China Seas; confrontation could creep into escalating military accidents.\n\nDump Treasury?\n\nIt could also pursue of dumping its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% if escalation does take place. Because U.S. assets comprise such a large share of China's (and, to a lesser extent, Russia's) foreign reserves, the Chinese are increasingly worried that such assets could be frozen through U.S. sanctions (like those already used against Iran and North Korea).\n\nDon't miss:\n\nOf course, dumping U.S. Treasurys would impede China's economic growth if dollar BUXX, -0.39% assets were sold and converted back into yuan USDCNH, -0.1433% (which would appreciate). But China could diversify its reserves by converting them into another liquid asset that is less vulnerable to U.S. primary or secondary sanctions, namely gold GC00, -0.18% . Indeed, both China and Russia have been (overtly and covertly), which explains the 30% spike in gold prices since early 2019.\n\nIn a selloff scenario, the capital gains on gold would compensate for any loss incurred from dumping U.S. Treasuries, whose yields would spike as their market price and value fell. So far, China and Russia's shift into gold has occurred slowly, leaving Treasury yields unaffected. But if this diversification strategy accelerates, as is likely, it could trigger a shock in the U.S. Treasuries market, possibly leading to a sharp economic slowdown in the U.S.\n\nRead more:\n\nU.S. won't sit idle\n\nThe U.S., of course, will not sit idly by while coming under asymmetric attack.\n\nIt has already been increasing the pressure on these countries with sanctions and other forms of trade and financial warfare, not to mention its own world-beating cyberwarfare capabilities. U.S. cyberattacks against the four rivals will continue to intensify this year, raising the risk of the first-ever cyber world war and massive economic, financial and political disorder.\n\nLooking beyond the risk of severe geopolitical escalations in 2020, there are additional medium-term risks associated with climate change, which could trigger costly environmental disasters. Climate change is not just a lumbering giant that will cause economic and financial havoc decades from now. It is a threat in the here and now, as demonstrated by the growing frequency and severity of extreme weather events.\n\nIn addition to climate change, there is evidence that are underway, leading to rapid global movements in and\n\nAny one of these developments could augur an environmental white swan event, as could climatic \"tipping points\" such as in Antarctica or Greenland in the next few years. We already know that is increasing; what if that trend translates into rapid marine acidification and the depletion of global fish stocks upon which billions of people rely?\n\nWhere we stand\n\nAs of early 2020, this is where we stand: The U.S. and Iran have already had a military confrontation that will likely soon escalate; China is in the grip of a viral outbreak that could become a global pandemic; cyberwarfare is ongoing; major holders of U.S. Treasury debt are pursuing diversification strategies; the Democratic presidential primary is exposing rifts in the opposition to Trump and already casting doubt on vote-counting processes; rivalries between the U.S. and four revisionist powers are escalating; and the real-world costs of climate change and other environmental trends are mounting.\n\nThis list is hardly exhaustive, but it points to what one can reasonably expect for 2020. Financial markets, meanwhile, remain blissfully in denial of the risks, convinced that a calm if not happy year awaits major economies and global markets.\n\nThis article was published with permission

than 76,000 cases, 2,249 deaths, Coca-Cola warns on impact", "body": "The Coca-Cola Company said Friday it still expects to reach its full-year guidance though COVID-19 will likely weigh on first-quarter results\n\nShares of cruise line operators fell on Friday after the U.S. Department of State said Thursday that U.S. citizens should \"reconsider\" traveling on cruise ships to or within Asia over concerns about COVID-19, the novel coronavirus has sickened more than 76,000 people worldwide.\n\nCarnival Corp. CCL, -1.96% was down 1.5%, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, -3.28% down 2.5%, and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, -3.53% down 3.5% in trading on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe State Department reiterated that sentiment on a call with reporters on Friday. \"This is a dynamic situation and U.S. citizens traveling by ship may be impacted by travel restrictions affecting their itineraries or ability to disembark, or may be subject to quarantine procedures implemented by the local authorities,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nThe Diamond Princess, a ship operated by Carnival that is now docked at a port in Yokohama, Japan, has reported 634 cases and two deaths as a result of the virus. Separately, Carnival's Westerdam cruise ship, which eventually docked at Sihanoukville, Cambodia, had been turned away from other ports over concerns of sick passengers. All three cruise line operators have canceled voyages in Asia.\n\n.\n\nThe travel industries have been particularly hard by the outbreak as dozens of countries have put into place travel restrictions. A new estimate from the International Air Transport Association predicts that COVID-19 may lead to $29.3 billion in lost revenue for airlines based on a scenario in which this outbreak has a similar impact on air travel demand to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), also a type of coronavirus.\n\nAir France-KLM AF, -2.43% said Thursday it expects to lose \u20ac150 million ($163 million) to \u20ac200 million as a result of the outbreak. \"We have totally stopped operations to China for both the main and secondary cities,\" CFO Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gagey told investors on an earnings call. Separately, the Empire State Realty Trust Inc. ESRT, -1.56%, which owns the Empire State Building in New York City, told investors that there are currently only six weekly flights between cities in China and New York City. Chinese tourists accounted for 3% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nThe Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board has said it expects to lose $921 million in direct spending from Chinese tourists in 2020.\n\nNorwegian, which anticipates losing 75 cents from earnings per share in 2020 after canceling 40 cruises in Asia, told investors on Thursday that customers began canceling cruises outside of Asia after the Diamond Princess was quarantined in Japan. Americans are now choosing to book cruises in Alaska and the Caribbean. \"You don't have to get on an airplane to get to the Caribbean ports,\" Norwegian CEO Frank Del Rio said on an earnings call. \"Those seem to be doing better than some of the more exotic or far-flung destinations.\"\n\nCOVID-19 was first detected in December in Wuhan, China. The outbreak has largely shut down Hubei Province, home to Wuhan, and slowed or halted factory production and consumer spending across parts of China.\n\nThe worldwide of COVID-19 has continued to slow even as cases in South Korea doubled overnight and China's Hubei Province updated its figures to include a tally of cases diagnosed among prisoners.\n\nThere are now 76,785 confirmed cases of and 2,249 deaths, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization. That is about 1,000 new cases, compared with the 3,000 or so new cases that were being reported daily in early February. Hubei reportedly added 271 infections among prisoners to its tally, a move that prompted questions about whether there are other unreported virus cases in the country, .\n\nOutside of China, a cluster of infections in South Korea led to the diagnoses of 100 new cases overnight, bringing the total number of cases to 204 there. South Korea has reported one death.\n\nIn the U.S., there are 34 confirmed cases. That includes 21 people who were repatriated from Asia, including 18 from the Diamond Princess, and another 13 cases, including a new one confirmed Thursday by the Humboldt County health department in California.\n\nHere's what companies are saying about the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses:\n\n* Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, -3.34% that the majority of its 38 stores in China have been closed since Feb. 3. The yoga gear seller said it continues to \"monitor the situation\" and will provide an update on the expected financial and operational impact during its fourth-quarter post-earnings conference call in late March.\n\n* The Coca-Cola Company KO, +0.49% said Friday to reach its full-year guidance though COVID-19 will likely weigh on first-quarter results. Coca-Cola said it currently estimates an approximate 2- to 3-point impact to unit case volume, 1- to 2-point impact to organic revenue, and 1- to 2-penny impact to earnings per share for the first quarter. The Chinese market makes up 10% of Coca-Cola's global volume, the company said in January.\n\n* ITT Inc. ITT, +3.77% on Friday providing a downbeat outlook that included an estimated impact from the outbreak. For 2020, the manufacturer currently expects adjusted EPS of $3.87, and offered a wider range of $3.72 to $4.02, compared with the FactSet consensus of $3.99.\n\n* Hormel Foods Corp. HRL, -1.52% expects its international business to have a \"very difficult\" second quarter as a result of COVID-19. The company said Thursday there has been a slowdown in sales in China, with many restaurants closed, but sales of pantry items like Skippy peanut butter and canned pork Spam have increased. \"Similar to other companies in China, all aspects of our in-country supply chain are operating more slowly and at higher cost than normal,\" CEO James Snee told investors.\n\n* Domino's Pizza Inc. DPZ, +0.19% said Thursday that fewer than 20 of its stores are closed in China and the outbreak is slowing down the openings of new stores in that market. Last year, Domino's opened 80 net new stores in China.\n\nAdditional reporting by Steve Goldstein and Tomi Kilgore\n\nRead more of MarketWatch's COVID-19 coverage:", "source": {"uri":

fresh dose of recession fear to the stock market ", "body": "The 30-year bond yield hit an all-time low, by some reckonings, and the yield curve is narrowing\n\nThe old saw used to be that when the U.S. sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.\n\nNow, a more apropos adage for market bears may be that when an outbreak of coronavirus grinds the world's second-largest economy to a halt, the rest of the world catches a recession.\n\nIndeed, recession fears resurfaced on Wall Street last week, even as equity markets stood not far from all-time highs, amid volatile trade that whipsawed mostly on jitters that supply chains and economies could suffer from the spread of the infectious illness that originated in Wuhan, China, known as COVID-19.\n\n\"The [coronavirus spread] definitely injects an element of uncertainty into markets for the near term and for the longer term as well,\" said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management.\n\nAnalysts at BofA Global Research said the probabilities of a recession have increased and that is reflected in the action in long-bonds like the 10-year Treasury note and the 30-year Treasury bond, which on record. Investors will flee to the presumed safety of U.S. government bonds, driving yields lower, with the hope of avoiding losses that can derail riskier assets in a selloff.\n\nThe 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, +0.00% fell 5.2 basis points on Friday to 1.92%, based on Tradeweb data, to an all-time low of 1.89%. The 10-year note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% also tumbled below the key level of 1.50%, last trading at 1.475%. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.\n\nBofA said a move for the 10-year below 1.4% could represent a tipping point for the market, one that raises the probability for a recession, particularly if the Federal Reserve continues to hold benchmark rates at the current 1.50-1.75% range.\n\nHere's how BofA's analysts put it (see attached chart): \"Indeed, breaking 1.4% in an on-hold context for the Fed creates a significant inversion of the curve, pushes recession signals higher...\"\n\nSee:\n\nPart of the worry for fixed-income folks is the flattening of the so-called yield curve, which traces the differential between short-term bonds and longer-term debt. Once flat, there is a greater potential for the curve to invert, leaving short-end debt paying out more than longer-dated obligations.\n\nInversions are seen as a reliable indicator of an economic downturn or recession. And one key measure of that the 2-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.00%, at 1.348%, and the 10-year, at 1.47%, on Friday, stood a narrow 12.2 basis points from inversion -- again.\n\nAlready, the 3-month T-bill TMUBMUSD03M, +0.00% at 1.554%, another key yield differential that economists look at when considering recession expectations, has inverted with the 10-year rate.\n\nRead:\n\nFor some, the reading of services activity from IHS Markit released on Friday also , which fell 4 points to 49.4. Any number over 50 signifies expansion; below 50 points to contraction.\n\nTom McClellan, , said the yield curve inversion that occurred in the summer of last year is still in force and that market participants have been too dismissive of that recession signal (see attached chart): \"Generally speaking, it takes about 15 months for those effects to show up in overall economic data,\" he wrote in a Thursday research note.\n\n\"Last year's yield curve inversion is still yet to be felt, and that is not even factoring the additional economic slowdown effect from the coronavirus,\" McClellan wrote.\n\nAmid all this recession talk, Gold GCJ20, -0.18% has been on a tear. The precious metal often draws heavy bids during market uncertainty. Last week, it gained 3.9% to settle at $1,648.80 an ounce, marking the sharpest weekly rally since the week ended June 21, according to FactSet data.\n\nInvestors couldn't stop talking about the shiny yellow metal, even through it's unclear if those bets will pay out over a longer term.\n\nEven so, the Fed doesn't yet seem inclined to lower rates to placate nervous investors. the central bank is unlikely to lower interest rates given the positive economic outlook. On CNBC on Friday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard appeared to be sanguine about the health of the U.S. economy, even as they watched coronavirus closely.\n\nBMO's Ma said that those takes may be justified because the health of the domestic economy doesn't appear to be one genuinely signaling that a recession is afoot.\n\nCorporate earnings for one have been mostly solid. \"Q4 results came in better than expected, rising 1.6% versus the expected 2.1% decline, representing the 32nd consecutive quarter in which actuals beat end-of-quarter estimates,\" said Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\nHowever, he said the outlook was softening, noting that \"2020 forecasts are now at 5.9% versus the 7.9% at the start of the year.\"\n\nCoronavirus is the likely culprit and the disease derived from the novel strain has more consistently given investors pause headed into the weekend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.78% matched its longest streak of declines on a Friday, five straight, since a period begun in March of 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nThat seems like an odd statistic but it's telling about investors willingness to hold on to assets they consider risky amid the developments around the infection.\n\nAll said, the Dow remains just 1.9% from its Feb. 12 record close, the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.05% is 1.4% away from its Feb. 19 closing peak and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.79% is 2.5% from its record after an ugly Friday.\n\nThe week ahead\n\nSaturday\n\nInvestors will watch for and results from Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.39% BRK.B, +0.51%.\n\nMonday\n\nEARNINGS FROM HP Inc.

The earnings announcement also fell on the same day as the company's investment community event.\n\nBiggs also said the company is saving 15% on the cost of vests worn by sales staff, which are made with recyclable materials. Biggs said the vests are \"more comfortable and more sustainable.\"\n\nSee:\n\nThis isn't the first time Walmart WMT, +0.01% has announced savings from a random corner of the business. Back in October 2018, the company said it would save by switching to a new floor wax that was cheaper and made it possible to buff the floors fewer times.\n\nWhile Walmart is anticipating big savings on shopping bags and associate uniforms, the impact of the coronavirus is still to be determined.\n\nRead:\n\nBiggs said the company anticipates a \"couple of cents negative impact\" in the first quarter from the coronavirus outbreak. The impact of the outbreak wasn't included in Walmart's fiscal 2021 outlook.\n\nWalmart is guiding for earnings per share of $5.00 to $5.15, up 1.5% to 4.5% from fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS, e-commerce growth of around 30% and Walmart U.S. same-store sales growth of at least 2.5%, excluding fuel.\n\nThe FactSet consensus is for EPS of $5.21 and domestic same-store sales growth of 3%.\n\nAlso:\n\nFourth-quarter , which Chief Executive Doug McMillon attributed to a variety of factors, including the shortened holiday shopping season, the shift to e-commerce and the lack of a hot toy.\n\nWalmart by 2%.\n\n\"Walmart's Q4 performance, which we characterize as tepid overall, indicates that the holiday season was if anything even more promotional than we anticipated, with its U.S. operating margin down around 75 basis points for the quarter, some of which was due to mix as lower margin food sales were strong while higher margin apparel was weak, some due to softness in key holiday categories such as toys, and some due to increased expenses around delivery,\" said Charlie O'Shea, Moody's lead Walmart analyst.\n\nGlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders notes that the holiday challenges at Walmart weren't unique to that retailer. Target Corp. TGT, +0.74% , for instance, talked about the of the shortened holiday season.\n\nHowever, Walmart saw some cannibalization from its e-commerce business, which grew 35% in the fourth quarter, with customers opting for a digital purchase rather than going to stores, Saunders said.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.79% didn't help either.\n\n\"Competition from Amazon heated up across multiple categories as its spending initiatives further heightened promotional activity as it drove sales above management's forecast, though in doing so it 'sacrificed' around 150 basis points of margin for the quarter,\" Moody's O'Shea said.\n\nWhat also hurt was unrest in Chile, with Biggs saying that some stores in that country were destroyed during political protests. The business there is not expected to recover in the coming fiscal year.\n\nDisruption in Chile coupled with a legal matter cost 5 cents per share in the fourth quarter. Chile hurt operating income by about $110 million.\n\nDon't miss:\n\n\"Overall, we think Walmart likely wasn't immune from some of the near-term pressures like a shortened holiday season that impacted competitors such as Target during the holiday season,\" wrote UBS analysts led by Michael Lasser.\n\n\"Still its early guidance leads us to believe that its current year-to-date performance in February has been strong and it's well positioned to take further share.\"\n\nUBS rates Walmart stock neutral with a $125 price target.\n\nWalmart stock is up 18.4% over the last year.

who beat the market", "body": "Two winning fund managers pick some favorite cash-generating stocks\n\nMany income-focused investors dwell on dividend yield and buy largely on that basis. More income is better, right?\n\nNot so, say the two dividend-minded mutual-fund managers who run the outperforming Guinness Atkinson Dividend Builder Fund GAINX, -0.52% . Matthew Page and Ian Mortimer use a much more nuanced approach to get high-achieving results. Over the past three years, they have beaten both their Morningstar World Large-Stock category and the MSCI ACWI Index by 1.9 and 1.4 percentage points, respectively, on an annualized basis.\n\nThat's a solid record given that most stock-fund managers lag their categories. So it's worth learning how Page and Mortimer operate to help you improve your own income-investing strategy.\n\nTheir system starts by identifying companies with the characteristics that exemplify long-term outperformance. Then they fish in this pond, since these businesses are likely to continue doing well. \"It stacks the odds in our favor,\" says Page. Here are the qualities they favor, and other tips on how to succeed in dividend investing:\n\n1. Go with dividend growers: Dividend stocks outperform, as a group, but companies with a history of increasing dividends do better, whereas companies with flat dividends tend to be more average. You want to own shares in companies that are likely to continue hiking dividends. To find those, look for these next four qualities.\n\n2. Favor companies with a high return on capital: Companies with a long history of investing smartly in their business will probably continue to spend wisely. This means they'll have more sustainable cash flow, so they're more likely to keep hiking dividends. A good long-term investment record is key. Studies show companies with a great investment track record over 10 years have a 95% chance of repeating their success over one year, and an 80% chance of doing so over four years.\n\nThere are many ways to measure corporate investment prowess, but Page and Mortimer use a gauge called . They favor companies with a cash-flow return on investment greater than 10% for 10 consecutive years.\n\n3. Go with moderate dividend yields: This sounds counterintuitive, but it makes sense if you think it through. First, having a moderate dividend makes it easier for a company to hike its dividend, simply because there is more room to grow. \"It's the law of large numbers,\" Mortimer says. Meanwhile, a high dividend is not always attractive. It means a company is less likely to hike payouts.\n\nMoreover, excessively high dividend yield due to a steep stock decline can be a sign of trouble. To identify promising companies in selloffs, the fund managers analyze the issue that's distressing investors, and favor companies with great investment track records. \"If a stock falls but it has high return on capital, you can make the argument there is a short-term issue,\" Page says.\n\n4. Look for strong balance sheets: When a company is stretched, it is more likely to be forced by the market to cut its dividend to pay its debt, Mortimer says. This can hurt a stock. A strong balance sheet means a company is less likely to cut its dividend.\n\n5. Go with cheap stocks: Page and Mortimer use valuation gauges such as price-earnings and free cash-flow yield. Be sure to compare a company's valuation to its peers or its own history, and not the market overall.\n\nTwo of the fund's holdings that look reasonably cheap right now are ANTA Sports Products ANPDF, +0.77% and British American Tobacco BTI, +0.59% . ANTA Sports Products sells sports apparel in China, and the stock has been hit by coronavirus fears. (My take is the .) British American Tobacco has been a weak stock because of health concerns about vaping, and increased Food & Drug Administration regulation of tobacco. \"We think they are being punished too much,\" Mortimer says of the stock.\n\n6. Make concentrated bets: This is a tactic that many outperforming managers use successfully. It's better to know a short list of names and invest only in them. These two managers like a portfolio of 35 stocks, with each representing about 3% of the portfolio. In contrast, many actively managed funds stick to 1% positions to get the \"benefits\" of wide diversification, which can actually hurt performance.\n\n7. Shop the world: Don't limit yourself to U.S. stocks. There are rich dividend payers around the world. The Guinness Atkinson managers aim for a 50-50 portfolio mix. The names singled out for this column are all non-U.S. companies, which makes sense from a valuation perspective because many international markets are lagging both the S&P 500 SPX, +0.59% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.48% .\n\nAlso, the fund managers recommend industrial conglomerate ABB ABB, +0.99% , whose shareholders may benefit from the sale of its power grid business, and Henkel HENKY, +1.92% , a consumer goods and chemicals business whose stock has been lagging in part because of automobile-sector weakness.\n\n8. Hold for the long term: The Guinness Atkinson portfolio has a relatively low 24% turnover rate, and has kept a third of its positions since its 2012 inception, including Microsoft MSFT, +0.33% , Procter & Gamble PG, +1.07% , Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.20% , Aflac AFL, +0.06% , and Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A, +0.26% .\n\n9. Get good at math: Page and Mortimer never went to business school, but they both have advanced degrees in physics from the University of Oxford. This is unusual in investing, but the experience has made them better investors because it helped turn them into quantitative analysts, influenced by numbers rather than \"stories.\" In this way, the fund managers are less likely to follow the crowd or focus on the size of dividend payouts.\n\nSays Mortimer: \"Rule number one: To get good dividend stocks, don't look at the dividend.\"\n\nAt the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. Brush has suggested MSFT, PG, JNJ and RDS.A in his stock newsletter,\n\nRead:\n\nMore:\n\nPlus: to get MarketWatch's best mutual funds and ETF stories emailed to you weekly!", "source": {"uri":

saying exactly that.\n\n\"In the nearer term...we believe the greater risk is that the impact of the coronavirus on earnings may well be underestimated in current stock prices, suggesting that the risks of a correction are high,\" chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer told clients.\n\nThe virus history books -- SARS in 2003 -- reveal that setbacks for markets are often temporary. But China's economy is \"six times bigger now than it was then,\" with Chinese tourism a 0.4% chunk of global GDP and missed work days in China equal to an two-month unplanned break for the entire U.S., he notes.\n\nOppenheimer points to Apple's AAPL, -1.03% latest warning that Wall Street largely shrugged off, noting that the company has been driving better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings results.\n\n\"During the fourth quarter, the five largest stocks in the S&P 500 (Facebook FB, -1.34%, Amazon AMZN, -0.79%, Apple AAPL, -1.03%, Microsoft MSFT, -1.53%, Google owner Alphabet GOOGL, -0.52% ) posted an average earnings surprise of +20%, compared with just 4% for the average S&P 500 company. Any weakness to these and other companies would likely push earnings estimates lower,\" cautions Oppenheimer.\n\nDon't look to stretched valuations in bond markets versus stocks to immunize against an equity pullback, he said. Not a sustained bear market, but don't hit the snooze button is the message.\n\nLast word goes to JPMorgan's top quantitative strategist Marko Kolanovic, who notes investors have been piling into technology, low-volatility stocks and bonds, driven by coronavirus fears and as passive-funds pile into stock winners. As a fan of value stocks, Kolanovic expects a rotation back to that asset class once the virus subsides.\n\n\"We caution investors that this bubble will likely collapse, i.e. this time is not 'different,' with valuations reverting closer to 2010-2020 average,\" he warns in a note.\n\nThe chart\n\nPalladium prices PAH20, +0.87% have been going parabolic, and the commodity is a fine Tesla TSLA, -1.96% contender as a \"green hedge\" for investors, says blog.\n\n\"Palladium is a key component in pollution-control devices for cars and trucks.

some stock-market investors fearing how it all ends", "body": "'Some of the largest stocks in the world have entered the manic phase': strategist\n\nWhat happens when everything rises all at once? That's what some investors are scratching their heads about as they look out at the current landscape on Wall Street.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.40%, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.47% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.87% indexes drifted toward record territory -- seemingly inoculated from coronavirus contagion.\n\nSpeculative stocks like electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. TSLA, +6.88%, and Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. SPCE, +23.27%, a space tourism company that only began trading publicly three months ago, also surged. Virgin's stocks is up, while Tesla has gained more than 41% over the same period.\n\nRead:\n\nBut it's more than just those names.\n\nGold prices GCH20, +0.01% are trading near the richest levels since 2013 and the U.S. currency, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.01%, is hovering near its loftiest level against a basket of a half-dozen rival currencies, in more than a year.\n\nSee:\n\nAnother asset, bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.20% BTCH20, -6.25% is barreling above $10,000, approaching its highest level since August, according to FactSet data.\n\nFrank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet, wrote that 19 exchange-traded funds were at or near records, including the iShares Global Infrastructure ETF IGF, +0.00%, Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF XLU, -1.08% and First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN, +0.15%.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of bond-pegged ETFs, which wouldn't be expected to rise while equities are gaining, were also near their recent highs, including iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF AGG, -0.03% and iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD, -0.14%.\n\nIt's almost as if investors putting money to work this year can't lose, and that setup has caused some confusion among strategists, investors and analysts.\n\nCappelleri said he's unsure if this is a true \"everything\" rally but advised caution.\n\n\"So, whether one thinks this is an 'everything' bull market or not, it's clear that various assets are rallying concurrently right now. And that makes it important to stay on the right side of those trends for as long as we can,\" he wrote on Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, hedge-fund billionaire Leon Cooperman told CNBC that he saw euphoria in pockets of the market. He said \"we're at the early stage of knocking on the door of euphoria but not quite euphoria.\"\n\nMichael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co., said that the market's multiasset rise can be attributed to one thing: \"unprecedented stimulus.\" Notably, easy-money policies from the Federal Reserve, which has kept U.S. benchmark rates at a 1.50%-1.75% range, with investors betting that the central bank will be more inclined to cut rates than to raise them in the near term, particularly with China's COVID-19 outbreak emerging as a global threat.\n\nAntonelli said the viral outbreak accounts for much of the catalyst for the state of play across markets. The infectious disease that emerged in Wuhan, China last, year, has hamstrung the world's second-largest economy. How significantly it has hurt China remains to be seen.\n\n\"We know that China is basically sitting idle right now. Once the pandemic slows a bit more I'd expect to see some really massive injections both fiscally and monetarily from the Chinese,\" Antonelli told MarketWatch.\n\n\"They can't let this pandemic threaten economic growth because if it did, that could threaten political stability,\" he said.\n\nFresh stimulus from China and an accommodative Fed may not provide much comfort, said Vincent Deluard, global macro strategist at INTL FCStone.\n\nHe paints a picture teeming with potential excess, where newly minted \"traders share screenshots of their extraordinary gains on Reddit and Twitter and savagely roast anyone who is not leveraged long their favorite highflying tech stocks.\"\n\nDeluard says one of his bigger concerns is that the rally isn't supported by solid fundamentals.\n\nHe argued that by one measure, tracking stock price gains compared against a number of measures, illustrated that equity valuations are historically rich.\n\nThe chart below shows the market value of the S&P 500 in aggregate compared against its replacement cost, or Tobin's Q; stock-market capitalization relative to gross domestic product; and the Shiller P/E, or price-to-earnings, ratio. Based on those measures, stock market caps represent 230% of GDP, Shiller P/Es are at their loftiest since 2000 and Tobin's Q is at a level last since in 1999, Deluard noted.\n\nOn top of that, the profits of small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.54% companies, meanwhile, have shrunk in each of the past four quarters, Deluard wrote.\n\n\"Even large-caps are not immune to the earnings recession: profits for the S&P 495 index (which excludes Facebook FB, -0.14%, Apple AAPL, +1.45%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.67%, Microsoft MSFT, +0.30%, Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.46% GOOGL, +0.36% ) declined by 3.9% in the past quarter.\n\nIt's impossible to say how long this tandem rally can last.\n\nLegendary mutual-fund manager John Templeton once said that bull markets don't succumb to old age, but die in a bout of euphoria.\n\nAnd that notion may be swirling in a number of investors' minds as this bull market that began March 9, 2009, heads toward its 11th anniversary.\n\nMatt Forester, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon's Lockwood Advisors, told MarketWatch that all this apparent optimism may evaporate if the coronavirus's impact is greater than investors are betting. \"A number of strategists are playing amateur epidemiologist and I think that's a little bit of a challenge,\" Forester said.\n\nHe also said some investments bets being placed currently also reflect that investors are playing defense, buying Treasurys as well as assets they think may grown in value.\n\n\"I think it's a function of investor positioning and sentiment. There's only been a few days of actual weakness so far in 2020, which means people have to keep chasing to keep up,\" Cappelleri told MarketWatch.\n\nIndeed, Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, in a Wednesday note, said that there were four distinct trading buckets in which investors are currently assessing the market: recession scare, defensive growth, momentum growth and value trade (see attached chart):\n\nDeluard said that what he describes a \"manic phase\" for stocks will eventually pop and lofty valuations and central bankers could be the cause. \"The main value of these examples is to illustrate that some of the largest stocks in the world have entered the manic phase, where mobs of leveraged individual investors have hijacked the normal price discovery process,\" he wrote in his research report. \"What could end this irrational euphoria?\"\n\nDeluard speculates that ultimately companies , which has been one of the key drivers of stock-market multiples. \"Buybacks, the single-largest source of demand for stocks in this cycle, will become the transmission channel through which irrational prices finally adjust to rising cost pressures,\" he wrote.\n\nRead:", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_decambre@marketwatch.com", "name": "Mark DeCambre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IShares", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IShares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallying", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rallying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratching", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scratching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comp_(command)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comp (command)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Antonelli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luca Antonelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPX_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SPX Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASDAQ Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_(motorsport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drifting (motorsport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin's_q", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobin's q"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Games_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent Games Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Democratic_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicaraguan Democratic Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBoxx", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IBoxx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baird_(investment_bank)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baird (investment bank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_G._Cooperman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leon G.

the coronavirus outbreak", "body": "Coronavirus is becoming a dominant theme in earnings releases and on companies' conference calls as investors seek to gauge its impact on corporate results\n\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that was first identified late last year in Wuhan, China, is becoming a dominant theme in the earnings releases and conference calls of S&P 500 companies as investors press for answers on how it will impact their financials.\n\nA FactSet search of the 364 earnings call that were held in the period stretching from Jan. 1 through Feb. 13 found 38% included the term \"coronavirus\" at least once. The industrial, IT and health-care sectors accounted for the highest number of companies discussing the topic, according to FactSet.\n\nWhile many were asked to quantify the negative impact on their businesses, 34% said it was too early to say and did not include the virus in their financial guidance. As a result, \"it is possible that there will be an increase in the number of companies issuing negative guidance later in the first quarter as these companies gain clarity on the impact,\" FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters wrote in written commentary.\n\nThis is what companies have been saying:\n\n* Agilent Techonologies Inc. A, -0.58% expects earnings of 72 cents to 76 cents a share on revenue of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion \"after factoring in the potential impact\" of the coronavirus. The lab instruments maker anticipates a $25 million to $50 million hit in the first half as a result of the virus; a $10 million loss in revenue in the first quarter and an estimated $15 million to $40 million impact in the second quarter. \"Our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus,\" CFO Robert McMahon said. \"This reduced the number of shipping days in China.\"\n\n* Analog Devices Inc. ADI, -2.06% updated its guidance for second-quarter revenue of $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. \"While the effects of the coronavirus are difficult to estimate and the situation remains dynamic, we have reduced our revenue guidance by $70 million to account for its potential impact,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n* Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.88% is not expecting to meet second-quarter financial guidance because production has slowed or been halted in China due to the COVID-19 outbreak. \"Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,\" the company said in a statement on Monday. Apple generates about 15% of its revenue from China, and many of its products are manufactured there.\n\nRead also:\n\n* Boston Scientific Corp. BSX, -0.39%, which has a $600 million business in China, is expecting a \"negative first-half impact\" on expectations that Chinese patients will push back elective medical procedures during the outbreak. The company lowered its quarterly sales guidance for the first quarter of 2020. The device maker now anticipates a \"preliminary negative sales impact estimate of $10 million to $40 million.\"\n\n* Capri Holdings Ltd. CPRI, -2.55%, which owns luxury brands Jimmy Choo and Versace, annual revenue of $5.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.45 to $4.50 as the virus eats into sales. That's below the FactSet consensus for revenue of $5.78 billion and per-share earnings of $4.87.\n\nRead also:\n\n* Carnival Corp. CCL, -1.09% said there could be a fiscal 2020 earnings-per-share impact of 55 cents to 65 cents if all operations are suspended in Asia through the end of April. If that comes to pass, according to Carnival, there would be a material impact on the business from suspended cruises in Chinese ports; cancellations in other parts of Asia; and the impact on bookings, which is determined by the length of time that an event influences travel.\n\n* The Coca-Cola Company KO, +0.20% said it is still expecting to reach its full-year guidance though COVID-19 will likely weigh on first-quarter results. Coca-Cola said it currently estimates an approximate 2- to 3-point impact to unit case volume, 1- to 2-point impact to organic revenue, and 1- to 2-penny impact to earnings per share for the first quarter. The Chinese market makes up 10% of Coca-Cola's global volume, the company said in January. \"China's economy was in a different place when SARS happened,\" CEO James Quincey said in January. \"It's worth noting that China's economy is [now] much bigger, and this could become more connected to the rest of the world.\"\n\n* Domino's Pizza Inc. DPZ, -1.96% said that fewer than 20 of its stores are closed in China and the outbreak is slowing down the openings of new stores in that market. Last year, Domino's opened 80 net new stores in China.\n\n* Ecolab Inc. ECL, +0.53%, a water technology company, said it anticipates a 5 cents hit to EPS as a result of the outbreak. CEO Douglas Baker told investors that if COVID-19 becomes seasonal, like the flu, it may change some behaviors. \"If you think if you go back to H1N1, that was really the advent of all the hand sanitizers you see in lobbies of all commercial buildings,\" he said, on an earnings call. \"Before that, it didn't exist. So it clearly changed the demand permanently for hand sanitizing products, etc. You may well see that kind of outcome as a consequence of the coronavirus, too.\"\n\n* The Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. EL, -0.78% said will be most impacted by the sales decline of luxury beauty products in China. The company updated its sales outlook for the second half of the year, saying it now predicts an increase of up to 1%, compared with the same period a year ago.\n\n* Expedia Group Inc. EXPE, -0.42% is expecting a $30 million to $40 million impact on adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. It also expects \"some impact beyond [the first quarter] in 2020 as well,\" CEO Barry Diller told investors. \"But the exact amount will depend on how long it takes for travel trends to normalize.\"\n\n* Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. FDP, -2.44% CEO Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh said port closures in China led to a slowdown in trucking and goods were left stacked up at ports over the extended Lunar New Year shutdown. He doesn't expect the outbreak to fade away before April. \"Usually these viruses, they don't subside until the weather starts warming up, and then we will see the situation getting improved,\" Abu-Ghazaleh told investors.\n\n* General Mills Inc. GIS, +1.72% said half of its H\u00e4agen-Dazs shops in greater China are closed, and the shops that remain open have \"severely restricted hours.\" Greater China makes up 4% of General Mills' net sales, 40% of its sales in the region are at H\u00e4agen-Dazs shops and other restaurants. The company told investors it can't yet share how the closures will affect its numbers for fiscal 2020.\n\n* Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, +1.90% is working with Chinese authorities to test its investigational antiviral remdesivir as a treatment for people with the new coronavirus. The drug maker plans to conduct a randomized, controlled trial in China as part of those plans, saying that remdesivir has shown \"in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens\" Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS, both of which are also coronaviruses.\n\n* Hasbro Inc. HAS, -3.06% continues \"to have office and third-party factory closures\" in China as a result of the outbreak. The company said that China is responsible for about two-thirds of its global sourcing. \"The biggest unknown right now is how quickly the manufacturing factories can get their production ramp back up,\" said Hasbro CFO Deborah Thomas. \"Travel is limited, [and] places are still closed.\"\n\n* Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. HLT, -1.56% said about 150 hotels, totaling approximately 33,000 rooms, are closed in China as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n* Hormel Foods Corp. HRL, -1.03% expects its international business to have a \"very difficult\" second quarter as a result of COVID-19. The company said Thursday there has been a slowdown in sales in China, with many restaurants closed, but sales of pantry items like Skippy peanut butter and canned pork Spam have increased. \"Similar to other companies in China, all aspects of our in-country supply chain are operating more slowly and at higher cost than normal,\" CEO James Snee told investors.\n\n* HSBC Holdings PLC HSBC, -0.03% expects a weaker first-half performance in 2020, due to the downturn in Hong Kong and virus-related credit losses in the first quarter, it said. \"The most extreme downside scenario in there I would say makes an assumption that the coronavirus is still continuing in the second half of this year,\" an executive said on an earnings call. \"If you look at that and that was to become the central scenario, there would be about $600 million of additional loan losses provisions required.\"\n\n* InterContinental Hotels Group PLC IHG, -1.23% said 160 hotels are closed in China or closed to new guests. The company's fee business is expected to take a $5 million hit in February in China, as a result of the outbreak. Its Chinese operations make up less than 10% of group operating profit. CEO Keith Barr told investors that the postponement and cancellation of conferences will have an impact on its operations, too. \"What I saw during H1N1 and other times in China, the key thing to remember is the Chinese government's ability to stimulate economic growth and activity is unlike any other country,\" he said, on an earnings call.\n\nSee:\n\n* IQVIA Inc. IQV, -0.78%, which runs clinical trials, including in China, said it expects a $25 million impact in the first quarter as a result of the outbreak. \"The patients who are enrolled in a trial are simply not going to visit the hospitals where all the sites are in China because that's kind of the more dangerous spot right now,\" CEO Ari Bousbib told investors.\n\n* ITT Inc. ITT, +3.28% updated its 2020 guidance, providing a downbeat outlook that included an estimated impact from the outbreak. For 2020, the manufacturer currently expects adjusted EPS of $3.87, and offered a wider range of $3.72 to $4.02, compared with the FactSet consensus of $3.99.\n\n* Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, -1.62% said that the majority of its 38 stores in China have been closed since Feb. 3. The yoga gear seller said it continues to \"monitor the situation\" and will provide an update on the expected financial and operational impact during its fourth-quarter post-earnings conference call in late March.\n\n* Medtronic PLC MDT, -0.41% told investors that there are closures and slowdowns in factory production of its products as well as a delay in medical device procedures in China as the Chinese health care system focuses on containing the virus. \"We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth-quarter financial results,\" CEO Omar Ishrak told investors, later adding: \"Even now, even in places like Beijing and others, procedures are only just beginning.\" China makes up 7% of Medtronic's global business.\n\n* Mondel\u0113z Inc. MDLZ, +0.07% told investors to expect \"an impact on both revenue and margins\" as China is a high-margin business for the snacks maker. It is also reporting additional transportation costs as a result of a shortage of trucks in China. \"I'm quite comfortable saying that there is nothing that taints really the full year at this point in time for us, pending maybe a bigger impact of the coronavirus, which quite frankly we don't see at this point,\" CFO Luca Zaramella told investors.\n\n* Nike Inc. NKE, -1.88% has closed about half its stores in China, while the remaining stores are reporting lower-than-expected retail traffic. The athletic-apparel maker said it plans to provide an update about the impact of the virus on its third-quarter earnings call.\n\n* Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, -1.59% expects the virus to shave off 75 cents from earnings per share in 2020. The cruise operator has canceled cruises in Asia -- that's 40 total -- through the end of the third quarter of 2020.\n\n* Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.58% expects the outbreak to materially impact earnings for the January to March quarter in China and for the overall company, given that China is the consumer goods giant's second-largest market. The company has 387 suppliers in China that ship to it globally more than 9,000 materials, impacting about 17,600 different finished products.\n\n* PVH Corp. PVH, -1.96%, owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, said that 20% of its global sourcing comes from greater China, which also made up 7% of its 2019 revenue. Most PVH-owned stores in China remain closed. Still, the company reaffirmed its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance of $1.79 for the fourth quarter and at least $9.45 for the full year.\n\n* Ralph Lauren Corp. RL, -2.35% said fiscal 2020 sales could be hurt by up to $70 million and operating income in Asia could take a $35 million to $45 million hit as a result of the outbreak. Two-thirds of the luxury retailer's mainland China stores have been closed for a week, and about half of its stores were closed another week.\n\nSee:\n\n* Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, -2.73% canceled 18 cruises in Southeast Asia and modified several itineraries as a result of the virus. The cruise-line operator said it expects an impact of 65 cents per share on its 2020 financial performance. If it has to cancel cruises in Asia through April, doing so would impact the company's 2020 financial performance by an additional 55 cents a share.\n\n* TripAdvisor Inc. TRIP, -1.52% said it may see a low-single-digit percentage impact on its financial results. \"We do see some unexpected or new cancellation levels in Asia, but we're not that exposed to Asia as an overall part of our business,\" CEO Stephen Kaufer told analysts.\n\n* Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, -1.13% has restarted some operations in China, but CEO Noel White said the company will face short-term impacts from the outbreak, even if the fallout eventually helps support government efforts in China to \"decrease\" the number of wet markets. Researchers believe that the virus, common to bats, may have been transmitted to humans via another animal sold at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet market in Wuhan. \"We'll continue to see modern grocery continue to grow in China,\" White said. \"The combination of [African swine fever] and coronavirus would expedite that transition.\"\n\n* Under Armour Inc. UA, -1.24% expects to lose between $50 million and $60 million in sales to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n* VF Corp. VFC, -0.75%, which owns the sneaker brand Vans, has closed 60% of its owned and partner stores in China. The shops that have remained open are reporting \"significant\" declines in retail traffic.\n\n* Visa Inc. V, -1.23% said it's too early to tell how the outbreak will impact the company. \"If planes are not flying in and out of China, if hotels are not being filled, which they're not at the moment, and if the supply chains are being impacted, which I suspect they are, there's going to be some impact,\" a Visa executive said at an investor day. \"It's just going to depend on how long this goes on.\"\n\n* Walmart Inc. WMT, +0.27% anticipates a financial impact in the first quarter and potentially the second quarter to its China business as a result of COVID-19. \"Due to the current sales mix slanted heavily toward food and consumables, as well as some increased expenses related to the outbreak, we could see a couple of cents negative impact in Q1,\" Walmart CFO Brett Biggs said on an earnings call. While many retailers have had to close some of their stores in China, Walmart said all of its stores are open, although the majority have restricted hours and some limited operations.\n\n* Walt Disney Co. DIS, -0.81% said if its shuttered Shanghai and Hong Kong theme parks remain closed for months, it would shave $175 million off operating income in the current quarter. Disney's movie-studio business could also take a hit, as cinemas are closed in China and Disney is preparing to launch the live-action \"Mulan\" reboot in March.\n\n* Yum China Holdings Inc. YUMC, -0.13%, which operates fast-food brands including KFC and Pizza Hut, has closed 30% of its restaurants. For those that are still open, same-store sales have declined up to 50% since the Lunar New Year. The outbreak is causing \"significant interruption,\" said Yum China Holdings CEO Joey Wat. Pizza Hut sales have struggled more than those of KFC, which has a stronger delivery business, as more Chinese customers are opting for takeout at home, the company said.\n\nDon't miss:", "source":

bond yield on Friday, sparking worries among investors who wonder what it's saying about the economy's future prospects.\n\nAnalysts say the slump in the long bond's yield this week reflects a confluence of factors including easy Federal Reserve monetary policy, concerns about the COVID-19 epidemic's impact on economic growth, and an absence of inflationary pressures.\n\nHistorically, a slump in long-term yields can indicate fears that growth will start to disappoint and inflation will fall which may make the real return on bonds more attractive.\n\nOn Friday the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield BX:TMUBMUSD30Y-2.32% fell 5.2 basis points to 1.92% based on Tradeweb data to an all-time low of 1.89%. The 10-year note yield also tumbled below the key level of 1.50%, last trading at 1.475%.\n\nHere's a few reasons why the bond-market made history on Friday.\n\nHeading into Friday investors were already on the watch for signs of the economy succumbing to the coronavirus epidemic amid fears that it would disrupt global supply chains and weigh on growth estimates for China which now has the second largest economy in the world.\n\nSee:\n\nSo when , the data sent panic among investors who received one of the first confirmations that the coronavirus impact could be more painful than thought.\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. government-shutdown of 2013, US business activity contracted for the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis in February, according to IHS Markit's flash PMI data. Adjusted for seasonal factors, the (covering both manufacturing and services) slumped to 49.6 in February, down from 53.3 in the opening month of 2020. Weakness was primarily seen in the service sector, where the first drop in activity for four years was reported, but manufacturing production also ground almost to a halt due to a near-stalling of orders.\n\n\"Compared with official data, statistical analysis indicates that the survey indices are consistent with GDP growth slowing from just above 2% in January to a crawl of just 0.6% in February\", Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, said.\n\nAs concerns around the coronavirus epidemic heat up, traders may also be looking to avoid holding short positions on long-dated Treasurys before the weekend, when further bad news on the coronavirus spread may be forthcoming.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine any scenario where we get an 'all clear' on the COVID-19 front by Monday. But things can certainly get much worse in the next 60 hours. That asymmetry means its very hard to go into the weekend short safe haven assets,\" said Jon Hill, an interest-rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nInvestors also turned to one of the usual suspects for the decline in long-term rates -- easy central bank policy.\n\nThough, members of the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee like the central bank is unlikely to lower interest rates given the positive economic outlook and tight labor market, traders are betting otherwise.\n\nworth of cuts by the end of the year.\n\n\"There's a lot of liquidity in the market, and we should expect even more stimulus from central banks,\" said Marcelo Assalin, head of emerging markets debt at William Blair, in an interview.\n\nHe added expectations for stimulus from the U.S. had not only driven income-hungry investors into government bonds but also into the highest-yielding corners of fixed-income markets such as emerging markets.\n\nKathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research sees the steady decline in inflation expectations as a key support for the rally in the 30-year bond also.\n\nThe 5-year, 5-year forward inflation expectation rate, which measures the expected inflation rate (on average) over the five-year period that begins five years from today, fell to 1.63% on Wednesday.\n\nAs economic growth worries take a toll on prices for industrial commodities and crude oil, forecasts for consumer prices to make a steady return to 2% have disappeared.\n\nFed officials have struggled to understand why inflation continues to shoot below their target even as unemployment rates have fallen and monetary policy has remained loose.\n\nThis persistent shortfall has led some researchers to suggest that inflation expectations are unanchored,

The entire tech sector is feeling the fallout from the epidemic, which is close to being labeled a pandemic with over 76,000 confirmed cases, mostly in China, where more than 2,200 people have died, and the numbers are rising daily.\n\nAnalysts at Omdia, a global technology research firm, said as the coronavirus spreads through tech's global supply chains, it is impacting the diverse yet interconnected sectors of the electronics industry. But especially hard hit will be products related to 5G, because it is in the throes of starting up.\n\n\"With the epidemic arriving at dawn of 5G's mainstream deployment phase, the coronavirus has the potential to disrupt the progress of the next-generation wireless standard, as the crisis slows or threatens to slow the production of key smartphone components, including displays and semiconductors,\" Omdia analysts wrote last week.\n\n\"We believe that China will take a significant position in the 5G era in both supply and demand of devices and network-wise,\" Omdia analyst Jusy Hong said in an email interview. \"The coronavirus outbreak will slow down production of network equipment and devices. Also, the outbreak is depressing the local economy of China and this will freeze smartphone demand in the country.\"\n\nRead also:\n\nThe spread of 5G technology is two-pronged: Networks must be deployed, and devices that can use those networks have to be developed, launched and sold. On the network side, Asia and Europe are seen as ahead of the U.S. in 5G, but they are still also in early stages of deployment and coronavirus could certainly slow progress overseas.\n\nCheck out this daily column:\n\nThat progress already was running slow before coronavirus, it seems. Xilinx Corp. XLNX, -2.42% -- which sells chips for 5G base stations -- said in that there was a pause in sales for infrastructure. Ominous warnings about the effects of coronavirus have turned into a chorus in more recent tech earnings reports, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.07% Chief Executive Daniel Zhang going as far as describing it as\n\nThose two negative elements just add to what was already a confusing network and device rollout. For example, in the U.S. there are at least two different types of 5G networks at the moment, with many confusing elements about the technology. The sub-6-gigahertz 5G and the millimeter-wave versions of the technology operate on different frequencies of the radio spectrum. Millimeter-wave 5G offers greater benefits in terms of data speeds and improvements in lag times, but there are technological limitations that make it hard for U.S. carriers to deploy it broadly.\n\n\"Sub-6 performs much more slowly but can travel a much further distance,\" said Bob O'Donnell, president of Technalysis Research. In addition, \"millimeter wave doesn't go through buildings or trees or it doesn't work indoors for the most part.\" The telecom carriers are also each embracing different spectrums, so some equipment will work on some networks but not on others. Different electronics and hardware makers are supplying products for different spectrums of the network.\n\n\"That why you hear so many conflicting stories,\" he said.\n\nU.S. wireless carriers are in the midst of national rollouts of the new wireless standard, but consumers are unlikely to experience the faster millimeter-wave 5G in much of their daily lives, at least at the outset. Wireless companies have talked about how millimeter-wave 5G is now present in many stadiums, for example, though the everyday 5G experience will mostly be centered on sub-6 technology, which offers more limited benefits over today's 4G connectivity but works better indoors.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the average consumer needs to learn more about this to know what to buy and what not to buy,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nDevices enabled with 5G capabilities are being introduced, but are expensive. In January, market researcher to consumers waiting for less-expensive 5G phones and better network coverage.\n\nDon't miss:\n\nthis quarter from Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.06% and AT&T Inc. T, -0.45% T, -0.45% reminded investors of what a long haul the upgrade to 5G is going to be, with analysts noting that the 5G upgrade cycle hasn't even started yet.\n\n\"The handset guys seem to be building the phones, I don't know how much of a network there will be to use,\" said Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst who follows semiconductors.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 005930, -1.33% launched a new smartphone that is designed to run on both of the different 5G spectrums in the U.S., but coronavirus could upset the supply chain needed to manufacture new phones. Rival Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.15% is expected to launch its first 5G-enabled iPhones later this year, but as the largest U.S. tech company admits, the coronavirus is already affecting its business, and it is hard to predict what future effects could be.\n\nRead:\n\nWhen this much confusion exists about large changes in technology, the big players typically can get together and figure out their issues, but coronavirus may get in the way of that too. Barcelona's Mobile World Congress, the biggest annual mobile-focused trade show, due to coronavirus fears. The move will lead to more delays of new product rollouts, especially in the handset area, and other related electronics. Intel Corp. INTC, -1.22% had been expected to launch new chips for 5G networks on the eve of the show, and that will have to be rescheduled.\n\n\"The products which were supposed to be launched in a week's time will be launched at a different date -- OEMs will have to make plans on that,\" said Gerrit Schneemann, senior analyst at Informa. \"Even if they can announce phones quickly, a disrupted supply chain means that they might not be able to actually ship any phones right away.\"\n\nTake a network rollout that is already problematic, add issues of constraints and slowdowns in key manufacturing regions in China, toss in questions about consumer demand for costly devices, and it's not a good recipe for a new technology. While there are greater things to worry about amid a potential global pandemic, those who have staked their livelihoods or investments on the 5G rollout have a lot to fear right now.\n\nMarketWatch

Here's why it hasn't paid out", "body": "The pandemic bonds have failed to release funds in its three-year history as recent virus outbreaks have not met conditions for a payout\n\nBack in 2017, the World Bank unveiled its first insurance-like pandemic bond, trumpeting it as a feat of financial innovation that showed how private investors could partner with the public sector to combat global health emergencies.\n\nBut with the facility having yet to disburse any funds in its almost three-year history, a period marked by several global health scares and the recent outbreak of COVID-19, some public health experts have argued that the bond did not work as intended and has unduly benefited investors.\n\nCatastrophe bond investors and reinsurance consultants, however, say the lack of a payout was not an indictment of the World Bank's pandemic bond in itself, and more of a reflection of the bond's strict conditions. Moreover, the fact the bond had yet to release funds did not mean it would not do so in the future, they said.\n\nThe World Bank said the pandemic bond was designed to swiftly funnel funds from the deep-pocketed financial sector to health authorities in poorer countries before international assistance could be mobilized. Early response efforts are seen as crucial among public health experts as a vigorous and swift containment response can help limit the growth hit from a pandemic.\n\nWith this goal in mind, the World Bank sold $320 million of these securities which are set to mature in July 2020.\n\nStructured as a catastrophe bond, the World Bank could offer double-digit yields, a level hard to find in a world of ultra-low interest rates. An additional bonus was that the bond's returns were un-correlated with broader financial markets.\n\nBut if a pandemic did strike, investors could lose their entire investment, including their principal, and the bonds would automatically funnel funds to the virus-afflicted countries.\n\nThe class A bond targeting influenza flu raised $225 million worth of funds, but it's the class B issue that has drawn the lion's share of attention as it covers non-flu diseases like COVID-19 and ebola.\n\nThe bond's conditions aren't triggered when the World Health Organization classifies a virus outbreak as a pandemic, but only when they meet a set of written conditions, much like an insurance policy.\n\nOn the face of it, the class B bond should have incurred losses during the 2018 ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the recent coronavirus from Wuhan, China, as both have resulted in deaths north of 250 people, the primary condition for a payout.\n\nMore than 76,000 cases of the coronavirus have been reported, and at least 2,200 deaths attributed to the disease,, which has not declared it a pandemic. And ebola caused more than 2,000 deaths in the DRC.\n\nSee:\n\nBut an important secondary condition states that there must be at least 20 deaths in a second country for the bond to release any funds, a requirement that has not been met by the coronavirus or the ebola outbreak.\n\nThe country with the highest death count from the coronavirus outside of China is Japan, which has suffered three deaths so far. While, deaths have also been reported in Hong Kong and in Taiwan, their tally is rolled into the overall one for China, .\n\nTo be sure, the class B note offering a 14% yield is trading at a range between 40 to 50 cents on the dollar implying that investors could now be expecting a sizable hit from the coronavirus as the number of confirmed cases in China's neighboring countries has climbed.\n\n\"It's trading as if there will be a payout,\" said Morton Lane, a financial consultant specializing on catastrophe bonds and a former employee of the World Bank.\n\nshows the bond has experienced considerable volatility after the ebola crisis and the coronavirus, as investors' expectations for a payout has vacillated.\n\nMichael Millette, managing partner at Hudson Structured Capital Management, says its too early to say whether the bond will avoid losses.\n\nThe coronavirus has exceeded the number of deaths from severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which struck in 2002 and has been viewed as the disease that offers the closest source of comparison to the coronavirus.\n\n\"Sars was a suppressed epidemic. The good thing that happened was that the spread was limited because of the quick actions that were taken. What is going on now is worse, the number of cases have surpassed Sars. The spread has not stabilized yet,\" said Millette.\n\nHe also pointed out the 2013-2016 ebola outbreak that ravaged Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and other African nations would have wiped out investors if the World Bank's pandemic bond had existed back then.\n\nLane said the pandemic bond should be understood as an insurance product, and not as a source of reserves that would send funds through to a donor country at the behest of World Bank officials. It was a financial instrument designed for the benefit of the public health sector, while spreading out the risk from owning the bond across investors.\n\n\"The issue is that people are thinking of the World Bank as a relief agency, when it's not,\" he said.\n\nBut regardless of whether the bond ends up paying out, public health experts says it was not superior to existing mechanisms for disbursing funds swiftly to countries reeling from deadly viruses, and therefore fell short of its original intentions.\n\nOlga Jonas, a Harvard researcher and a former World Bank economist who has monitored the pandemic bond, likened the debt issue to \"casino banking,\" a piece of unnecessary financial engineering whose benefits mostly accrued to investors.\n\nShe said in the DRC, mostly financed by its International Development Association arm, which offers grants and cheap loans to developing countries. In contrast, the pandemic bond had not sent any funds to combat the virus.\n\n\"[The World Bank] does not need to buy exotic insurance to finance its responses to outbreaks in poorest countries,\"

helicopter parents? Welcome to the world of helicopter investing and our call of the day from Barclays Wealth Management's chief investment officer William Hobbs, who finds overly anxious investors living in the \"long shadow\" caused by the financial crisis.\n\n\"The most common narrative in markets is what to do when the next recession comes along -- own Treasurys, own gold, own quality to such an extent that my concern would almost be that if the next recession is of a more normal variety, such as a stock retracement of 10% to 15% and moderate declines in unemployment, you'll find that you have overprotected yourself and the underperformance could actually be in the areas which you thought were giving you safety,\" Hobbs told MarketWatch.\n\n\"Those companies that offer a degree of economic dependability, that enjoy strong competitive advantages, and strong visible cash flows, their worth may be being exaggerated,\" said Hobbs, adding that some government bonds seem to be \"return-free risk rather than risk-free returns.\"\n\nThe truth is, investors can't reliably predict recessions, and shouldn't be obsessing about it, he said. \"What we can say is some of the previous causes of some of the nastiest recessions in history are so far substantially absent\" and Barclays thinks the economic cycle can carry on for a little while longer.\n\nOf course, coronavirus ripples could \"roll up in potentially much more cyclical and disruptive ways that we anticipate,\" he cautioned.\n\nBut a smart investor mindset for the next five to 10 years is one that accepts all the bumps in the road can't be dodged, whether from the economy or otherwise. Or, said Hobbs, you miss out on the reason for investing in the first place -- \"to harvest returns from ongoing human ingenuity.\"\n\nThat means \"diversified exposure to the world's stock markets, and that is the beauty of the modern world relative to the worlds of decades past. I can now get...almost free access to all of the world's stock markets, and exposure to that global ingenuity,\" said Hobbs.\n\nWhere to find all that ingenuity? He said Barclays is leaning toward emerging markets, in particular Asia, but away from one area that looks a bit pricey -- the U.S. megacap space.\n\nRead:\n\nThe chart\n\nBank of America Merrill

January to March quarter. China is the company's second largest market.\n\nThe number of appeared to taper off on Thursday morning; however, that may be due to another change in how China's Hubei Province is counting cases.\n\nCOVID-19 is a type of coronavirus similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December.\n\nLast week, Hubei the people who have been diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scans in addition to laboratory tests. Doing so sharply increased the number of cases being reported by Hubei, the province that is home to Wuhan, and led to criticism. Going forward, Hubei only plans to count cases confirmed by lab tests, .\n\nThere are 75,748 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and at least 2,129 deaths, primarily in mainland China, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization (WHO). The number of newly confirmed cases worldwide (463 cases) is significantly smaller than the increase reported on Wednesday (1,871 cases).\n\nOutside of China, the outbreak has spread to 26 other countries, leading to 1,076 cases and seven deaths, including two recently reported deaths in Iran, WHO officials said Thursday.\n\nWhile health officials still say that the most severe cases and the largest number of cases are in China, they are also paying close attention to the 621 confirmed cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is docked at a port in Yokohama, Japan. At least two of those passengers, both in their 80s with underlying health conditions, have died, according to comments made by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during a call with reporters on Thursday. The number of cases in South Korea has also increased by 22 overnight, now at a total of 104 cases. About 15 who attended a church service in Daegu have been diagnosed with the virus, .\n\n* Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.91% to materially impact earnings for the January to March quarter in China and for the overall company, given that China is the consumer goods giant's second-largest market. The company has 387 suppliers in China that ship to it globally more than 9,000 materials, impacting about 17,600 different finished products.\n\n* Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, -6.75% said from earnings per share in 2020. The cruise operator has canceled cruises in Asia -- that's 40 total -- through the end of the third quarter of 2020.\n\n* Smith & Nephew PLC SN, +7.26% SNN, +7.09%, which sells implantable medical devices, said few elective surgeries were performed in China in February as health care providers focused on containing the outbreak. The medical technology company generated 7% of its revenue, or $336 million, in 2019 in China. However, a company executive told investors that once the outbreak wanes, there will be pent-up demand for medical services that were put off. \"If someone needs an artificial hip, that demand will still be there in a couple of months' time,\" he said during an earnings call.\n\n* Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. FDP, +3.76% CEO Mohammad Abu-Ghazaleh said port closures in China led to a slowdown in trucking and goods were left stacked up at ports over the extended Lunar New Year shutdown. He doesn't expect the outbreak to fade away before April. \"Usually these viruses, they don't subside until the weather starts warming up, and then we will see the situation getting improved,\" Abu-Ghazaleh told investors.\n\n* Lenovo Group Ltd. 992, +7.01%, which manufactures smartphones at its still-closed factory in Wuhan, said that two factors are impacting its business: not all employees in China have returned to work at factories that have been slow to reopen (its facility in Chengdu is also still closed), and supply chain and logistics have been disrupted. It also said its personal computers and smart devices and its data businesses may benefit from increased demand for tools that allow for remote work, education, health consulting and entertainment.\n\n* Ecolab Inc. ECL, -1.90%, a water technology company, said it anticipates a 5 cents hit to EPS as a result of the outbreak. CEO Douglas Baker told investors that if COVID-19 becomes seasonal, like the flu, it may change some behaviors. \"If you think if you go back to H1N1, that was really the advent of all the hand sanitizers you see in lobbies of all commercial buildings,\" he said, on an earnings call. \"Before that, it didn't exist. So it clearly changed the demand permanently for hand sanitizing products, etc. You may well see that kind of outcome as a consequence of the coronavirus, too.\"\n\nRead more of MarketWatch's COVID-19

vice president of GoldMining Inc.\n\nGold for April delivery GCJ20, +0.36% on Comex rose $8.20, or 0.5%, to settle at $1,611.80 an ounce after surging 1.1% on Tuesday. Prices for the most-active contract marked the highest settlement since March 21, 2013, according to FactSet data.\n\nRead:\n\nIn electronic trading, April gold briefly edged up, then fell from the Wednesday's settlement. It was at $1,610.50 an ounce shortly after minutes from the rate-setting U.S. Federal Open Market Committee's January meeting were released. The meeting notes showed that Fed officials believe the U.S. economy seemed stronger in late January than they had expected.\n\nRead:\n\nStill, gold prices have managed to climb so far this week, despite some factors that should weigh on the metal. Prices have been supported by comparatively weaker government bond yields and a Federal Reserve that has kept interest rates low, analysts said.\n\n\"There are many theories as to why gold has suddenly seen such a bullish impulse with coronavirus risk certainly one of them, but the yellow metal is also benefiting from more fundamental factors such as the fact that for the first time in more than a decade central banks have been net buyers,\" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX Strategy, in emailed commentary. \"But perhaps the single greatest reason for [gold's] strength is that real interest rates are negative and continue to progressively remain so.\"\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.54% was at 1.561%, up modestly Wednesday, but down for the week. Low yields can make precious metals, which don't offer a coupon, more attractive to investors.\n\nGold briefly pared gains after U.S. economic data published early Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. producer-price index jumped 0.5% last month, the largest gain since the fall of 2018. Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted a 0.2% advance. And a report on housing showed that builders started construction on new homes in the U.S. at a pace of 1.57 million in January, the Commerce Department , representing a 3.6% decrease from a revised 1.63 million in December, but was 21.4% higher than a year ago.\n\nAmong other metals, March silver SIH20, +0.94% picked up 16.1 cents, or 0.9%, to end at $18.311 an ounce, extending its climb to its highest finish since early January of this year.\n\nRead:\n\nMarch copper HGH20, +0.19% edged up by less than 0.1% to $2.606 a pound. April platinum PLJ20, +1.41% added 1.1% to $1,004.50 an ounce, with prices for the most-active contract logging its highest finish since Jan. 24, FactSet data show.\n\nMarch palladium PAH20, +3.34% added nearly 3% to $2,571.20 an ounce, extending its climb to fresh records.\n\nWhile many doubt the largest palladium supply deficit projections will be realized \"due to softer Chinese auto catalyst inspired [platinum group metals] demand, it is possible that the explosion in prices will result in physical palladium supply being hoarded by investors,\" analyst at Zaner Metals wrote in a daily note.

INTC, -1.70% weighed on the Dow, as investors grew increasingly wary about potential fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nStocks also came under pressure after for the first time in four years owing to disruptions caused by the coronavirus and growing angst over the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. The forecasting firm said its activity indexes for both manufacturers and service-oriented firms declined this month. And the service sector index turned negative for the first time since 2015. In a big surprise, the index covering the large service side of the economy sank 4 points to 49.4, IHS Markit said Friday. A reading of less than 50 indicates a contraction in activity.\n\nThe spread of the virus inside and outside of China has been unsettling the market lately, likely contributing to gains in havens like government bonds and gold, with investors showing reluctance to hold on to equities heading into the weekend.\n\n\"The coronavirus outbreak contains a significant likelihood of impact to the global economy and the potential to become a black-swan type event,\" warned Bank of America Global Research rates strategist Bruno Braizinha, in a client note Friday.\n\n\"The uncertainty has been reflected in the market and has naturally led to an increase in recession probabilities.\"\n\nRead:\n\nEconomists at Standard Chartered Bank on Friday estimated that COVID-19 epidemic could affect 30% of China's imports and 10% of its exports, prompting them to lower their gross domestic product forecast for China this year to 5.5% from 5.8%.\n\nSouth Korea has reported 48 more cases, bring its total infections from the novel coronavirus to 204, and in Japan, officials from Tokyo and Osaka said they wouldn't hold large events such as school graduation ceremonies and entrance examinations for three weeks through mid-March, in an effort to contain the viral outbreak, .\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization confirmed cases of the illness and 2,247 deaths, marking another day in which the number of new cases world-wide has slowed.\n\nThe full economic impact of the disease is unclear but early indications suggest that it is already denting China's car sales.

investors", "body": "Gold is usually used as a haven for turbulent times, but not lately\n\nMomentum investors, who are relentlessly pushing up stocks, are oblivious to the breakout in gold amid a relatively rare event. Because of that, prudent investors should pay attention.\n\nLet's explore the issue with the help of a chart.\n\nChart\n\nPlease click for an annotated chart of SPDR Gold Shares GLD, +1.50%, a gold exchange traded fund.\n\nNote the following:\n\n* The chart shows the previous resistance line, which has now become the support line.\n\n* The chart shows a technical breakout in gold. This is a positive for gold but negative for stocks.\n\n* The chart shows the breakout occurred after two shallow pullbacks. This is a positive for gold.\n\n* The chart shows that the breakout is occurring on four rare things coming together.\n\n* Gold is priced in dollars. For this reason, when the dollar rises, gold falls. Lately the dollar is becoming stronger, but gold is jumping instead of sinking.\n\n* Typically gold goes down when the stock market goes up, especially if there is an aggressive increase in the stock market, as has been happening lately. However, gold has broken out as the stock market has ascended.\n\n* Gold typically goes up when there is a new safe-haven event, such as war. Here, gold did not break out on the emergence of the coronavirus crisis. However, now that the coronavirus scare has been subsiding, gold is moving up. Gold breaking out under these circumstances is rare.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to .\n\n* The smart money (professionals) has not been buying gold until now, but it has jumped in with light buying. This behavior is rare, as the smart money typically buys on pullbacks.\n\n* This breakout in gold is of major significance, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.78% is in a strong uptrend and investors' portfolios concentrated in mega-caps such as Apple AAPL, -2.26%, Amazon AMZN, -2.65%, Facebook FB, -2.05% and Alphabet GOOG, -2.18% GOOGL, -2.21%.\n\n* Semiconductors have been the leading indicators of the stock market. Investors should keep a careful watch on semiconductor stocks such as AMD AMD, -6.97%, Micron Technology MU, -3.41%, Nvidia NVDA, -4.74% and Intel INTC, -1.70%. Semiconductors are overbought and vulnerable.\n\n* Investors should also keep an eye on short-squeezes in stocks such as Virgin Galactic SPCE, -9.10%, Tesla TSLA, +0.18%, Enphase ENPH, +0.60% and SolarEdge SEDG, -0.09%.\n\n* There are new concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on earnings. Investors should stay tuned to the news from China as well as to earnings-related announcements.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nStay cautiously bullish on stocks and consider adding gold, silver and precious-metals stocks on pullbacks in the broader market.\n\nAmong ETFs, consider watching iShares Silver Trust SLV, +0.82%, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX, +3.03% and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF GDXJ, +2.77%.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time. is an investor, engineer and nuclear physicist by background who has founded two Inc. 500 fastest-growing companies.

2,000 deaths, Walmart predicts Q1 impact on EPS", "body": "Walmart Inc. executives said it expects an impact from the virus on EPS in the first quarter, even though all of its stores in China remain open\n\nThere are 75,203 of COVID-19, the coronavirus first identified in December in Wuhan, China, and 2,009 deaths, according to the most recent figures from the World Health Organization.\n\nMost of the cases and deaths are in China. In the U.S., there are 15 cases.\n\nThe largest cluster of cases outside of China is the Diamond Princess cruise ship, part of Carnival Corp. CCL, +0.99%, currently docked in Yokohama, Japan. There are now 621 confirmed cases of the virus among passengers and crew on the ship.\n\nThere are 100 U.S. citizens on the ship or in Japanese hospitals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Tuesday that they must now undergo a 14-day quarantine after leaving the Diamond Princess and before they can return to the U.S. \"Because of their high-risk exposure, there may be additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the remaining passengers on board the Diamond Princess,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\non Thursday. The government shut down gaming operations at casino operators on Feb. 4 over outbreak concerns, , including Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS, +1.38%, MGM Resorts International MGM, +0.22%, and Wynn Resorts WYNN, +2.03%. However, the Macau government said Monday that it is also considering implementing body-temperature checks at casino entrances, requiring employees and customers to wear masks, and setting apart gaming tables by an unspecified distance.\n\n* Medtronic PLC MDT, +0.99% told investors that there are closures and slowdowns in factory production of its products as well as a delay in medical device procedures in China as the Chinese health care system focuses on containing the virus. \"We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth-quarter financial results,\" CEO Omar Ishrak told investors, later adding: \"Even now, even in places like Beijing and others, procedures are only just beginning.\" China makes up 7% of Medtronic's global business.\n\n* Walmart Inc. WMT, -1.63% it anticipates a financial impact in the first quarter and potentially the second quarter to its China business as a result of COVID-19. \"Due to the current sales mix slanted heavily toward food and consumables, as well as some increased expenses related to the outbreak, we could see a couple of cents negative impact in Q1,\" Walmart CFO Brett Biggs said on an earnings call. While many retailers have had to close some of their stores in China, Walmart said all of its stores are open, although the majority have restricted hours and some limited operations.\n\n* Agilent Techonologies Inc. A, +0.66% of 72 cents to 76 cents a share on revenue of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion \"after factoring in the potential impact\" of the coronavirus. The lab instruments maker anticipates a $25 million to $50 million hit in the first half as a result of the virus; a $10 million loss in revenue in the first quarter and an estimated $15 million to $40 million impact in the second quarter. \"Our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus,\" CFO Robert McMahon said. \"This reduced the number of shipping days in China.\"\n\n* Analog Devices Inc. ADI, +4.49% for second-quarter revenue of $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. \"While the effects of the coronavirus are difficult to estimate and the situation remains dynamic, we have reduced our revenue guidance by $70 million to account for its potential impact,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n* Mondel\u0113z Inc. MDLZ, -0.60% told investors to expect \"an impact on both revenue and margins\" as China is a high-margin business for the snacks maker. It is also reporting additional transportation costs as a result of a shortage of trucks in China. \"I'm quite comfortable saying that there is nothing that taints really the full year at this point in time for us, pending maybe a bigger impact of the coronavirus, which quite frankly we don't see at this point,\" CFO Luca Zaramella told investors.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ciara Linnane and
