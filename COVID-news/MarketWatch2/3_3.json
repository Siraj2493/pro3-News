Restaurants must to shutter their dining rooms and only offer takeout or delivery.\n\n\"This is effecting the lives of our citizens. People are dying. Every day that is delayed here, I'm losing a dozen people on the back end that are going to die as a result of this,\" Sisolak said at a news conference Tuesday night.\n\nSisolak's order follows similar moves by more than 10 other governors as states scramble to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19.\n\nThe Las Vegas will be shut down for the first time since the JFK assassination in 1963.\n\nNevada's governor gave thousands of businesses in the tourism mecca less than a day to prepare. Though a number of casinos started to close their doors this week, the governor's sweeping order shutters Nevada's main industry, anchored by glimmering casinos lining the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nThe closures are part of federal guidance recommending social distancing. President Donald Trump has urged Americans to follow sweeping guidelines for the next few weeks, including for older residents to stay home and for all people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 as well as restaurants and bars.\n\nSisolak's unprecedented order comes after many casinos in Las Vegas moved to shut their doors entirely and the mayor of Las Vegas said she hoped bars and restaurants would be able to stay open.\n\nSee also:\n\n\"My hope is that private industry rises to the top, that they're allowed to stay open and take care of these families that are paycheck to paycheck,\" Mayor Carolyn Goodman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nThe mayor of Reno had issued an order similar to Sisolak a day earlier, telling many of those non-essential businesses to close in that city starting Friday at 5 p.m. Mayor Hillary Schieve initially included casinos but rescinded that, allowing gambling operations to continue.\n\nThe last time casinos closed in Las Vegas was for John F. Kennedy's funeral on Nov. 25, 1963. Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said in an email to The Associated Press Tuesday night that to his knowledge, it was the first time all Nevada casinos have been ordered closed statewide. He previously said this week's intentional casino closures may be only the fourth since gambling was legalized in Las Vegas in 1931.\n\n\"The state occasionally revoked a license and ordered one closed, but nothing like this,\" he wrote.\n\nNevada has reported more than 50 cases of the virus so far, including one death. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nIn Las Vegas, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts announced earlier in the week they planned to close their properties. Tuesday morning, three more casino resorts joined in.\n\nThe MGM casino closures of 13 properties included the Bellagio and its famous fountain show in front, which often draws a crowd to watch the fountains shooting as high 460 feet (140 meters) into the air, choreographed to lights and music.\n\nThe Hoover Dam, near the Arizona border and another Nevada tourist attraction, is temporarily closing to visitors \"because of the nature of the structure and an inability to implement social distancing standards recommended by the\" CDC, according to a statement.\n\nWith businesses closing and tourism expected to drop off, the state is forecasting a financial hit, but how big is unknown.\n\nIn Nevada, gambling taxes are second only to sales taxes as a percentage of the state's annual budget. The leisure and hospitality industry directly employs one of every four workers in the state and has an economic output of about $68 billion in Nevada, according to the Nevada Resort Association.\n\nThe state's biennial Legislature isn't scheduled to meet again until 2021, and legislative leaders are not yet planning to go into a special session to address Nevada's budget.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson, both Democrats, said in a joint statement provided to the Associated Press on Tuesday that they're evaluating all options and they're working closely with the governor.\n\nBut \"at this time, we have no plans to go into a special session,\" they said.\n\nState officials have not yet released any numbers of how many people have filed claims for unemployment benefits over the past few days.\n\nSisolak said over the weekend that the state was in \"relatively good shape\" to pay unemployment claims but it cannot last forever and the state was working to get some additional assistance from the federal government.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@marketwatch.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governors_of_Nevada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of governors of Nevada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sisolak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Sisolak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Restaurant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McCarran International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Goodman_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolyn Goodman (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Their valuation to earnings ratios were low, even as profits rose dramatically.\n\nBut despite a history of rough patches during unforeseen events, such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the volcanic eruption in Iceland in 2010 that disrupted air travel, large U.S. airline companies spent most of their free cash flow over the past 10 years on share buybacks, propping up their quarterly earnings-per-share results.\n\nSo did aerospace giant Boeing BA, -17.92%, but to a lesser extent.\n\nFree-cash-flow and stock-buyback data for six large airline companies and Boeing are shown below.\n\nBailouts expected\n\nAirlines have a long history of bankruptcies, and there is a very long of of Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 filings, including TWA in 2001 and Eastern in 1991.\n\nNow, large U.S. airlines and Boeing have requested massive aid from the federal government. Talks are ongoing, but President Trump said Tuesday that \",\" which is the largest U.S. exporter.\n\nBoeing said March 17 that \"\" was appropriate for the aerospace-manufacturing industry.\n\nTrump has been , who are seeking $50 billion in government money, .\n\nBailouts may be necessary, and it remains to be seen .\n\nRead:\n\nFree cash flow and buybacks\n\nMost investors know that cash flow is more important than earnings, because revenue can be booked, and profits shown, before a company actually receives payment. A company's free cash flow is its remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. Free cash flow can be used to pay for dividends, buy back shares, expand operations or invest in other improvements for the business.\n\nCompanies that built up hoards of cash, such as Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -8.08%, have been criticized for doing so, because it lowers a company's return on invested capital.\n\nThen again, Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett has shown during down markets that the extra cash can be put to work by scooping up other companies' shares at low prices, or making special, lucrative preferred-stock deals, such as the one Berkshire did with Goldman Sachs GS, -11.75% during the 2008 financial crisis. Berkshire had $125 billion in cash and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills as of Dec. 31.\n\nNobody could have predicted the coronavirus outbreak, but it is having a tremendous effect on Apple AAPL, -2.44%, not only because most of its stores are closed, but because iPhones are assembled at Foxconn's 2354, -7.60% factories in China. But Apple has also been criticized for holding too much cash. It had $39.7 billion in cash, plus $67.4 billion in \"marketable securities\" as of Dec. 28. The extra cash will serve the company well during a massive decline in sales.\n\nCompanies use free cash flow to repurchase shares for several reasons. If the share count is reduced, it boosts earnings per share. If a company is issuing a significant number of new shares as part of its executive-compensation packages, buybacks mitigate the dilution of other shareholders' ownership percentages.\n\nA company may buy back shares because its executives cannot think of any better use for the money (such as expansion, equipment replacement, new product or service development, etc.), or maybe because the executives and board members are overly fixated on quarterly earnings results and boosting the share price, rather than the long-term health of the business and its ability to navigate storms.\n\nAnalysts, investors and corporate executives often call buybacks a \"return of capital\" to shareholders. This isn't necessarily the case if the share price declines, despite the buybacks, or it eventually becomes clear the company was underinvesting in its ability to deliver competitive products and services.\n\nThe data\n\nFactSet provided 10 years of free-cash-flow data, through the end of 2019 for the five airlines in the S&P 500 Index SPX, -5.18% plus JetBlue Airways JBLU, -19.53% and, separately, for Boeing.\n\nHere is combined data for the six airlines:\n\nS&P 500 airlines + JetBlue Ticker Free cash flow, past 10 years ($ millions) Dollars spent on common-stock buybacks - past 10 years ($ millions) Buybacks/FCF Southwest Airlines Co.

loans shot up higher over the past week as demand for refinances remained strong despite major fluctuations in stock and bond markets.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.65% during the week ending March 19, an increase of 29 basis points from the previous week, Freddie Mac FMCC, +2.83% . This was the largest weekly increase in the average 30-year mortgage rate since November 2016, and it's the highest mortgage rates have been since mid-January.\n\nThe noted uptick in 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates is a major reversal from just two weeks ago, when they had hit a record low .\n\nRead more:\n\nThe 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also jumped 29 basis points to 3.06%, according to Freddie Mac. The 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage rose by 10 basis points to an average of 3.11%.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve had announced that it was cutting its benchmark interest rate to a range of 0.25% to 0%, mortgage rates do not generally track the Fed's movements directly. Instead, they roughly follow the direction of longer-term bond yields, including the 10-year Treasury note.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.119% rose above 1% this week for the first time in roughly two weeks. The increase came about largely as a result of Congress' approval of a major spending package aimed at curbing the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., as well as discussions of .\n\n\"The plan will require a large amount of government debt to be issued, in the form of U.S. Treasuries,\" said Zillow ZG, +3.14% economist Matthew Speakman. \"Knowing that more bonds will be in the market soon, current Treasuries suddenly warranted lower prices in recent days, which coincide with higher yields.\"\n\nAlso see:\n\nBond yields also responded to the Fed's actions this week, including its choice to re-engage in bond purchasing activity in order to stimulate financial markets.\n\nMeanwhile, lenders continued to have their own issues to grapple with when it came to pricing mortgage rates this week. \"Mortgage rates rose again this week as lenders increased prices to help manage skyrocketing refinance demand,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist, in the report.\n\nThose aiming to get a new mortgage -- either to refinance their existing home loan or to purchase a mortgage -- about interest rates staying this elevated. Economists have said lenders will likely bring rates back down to an extent once they've worked through their backlog of applications. And with the coronavirus outbreak still playing out, market volatility is likely here to stay for some time.\n\n\"With so much still uncertain, and market movements remaining unpredictable, it's a losing game to try and predict where rates are heading next,\" Speakman said. \"But it's safe to say that more dramatic movements are likely on the horizon.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_passy@marketwatch.com", "name": "Jacob Passy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustable-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adjustable-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage-backed security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GQ055_cr_hou_ZG_20180913161005.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 3784}, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 3784, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1485885187", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-16", "time": "17:26:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-16T17:26:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-16T17:24:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/romney-other-lawmakers-call-for-sending-1000-checks-to-americans-as-part-of-coronavirus-response-2020-03-16", "title": "Romney, other lawmakers call for sending $1,000 checks to Americans as part of coronavirus response", "body": "Two Democratic congressmen propose sending between $1,000 and $6,000 to every American making less than $65,000 a year\n\nAs Congress considers stimulus measures to help Americans who are facing financial problems because of the coronavirus outbreak, some lawmakers are calling for the government simply to put checks in the mail.\n\nRepublican Sen.

Federal Reserve -- we'll have up to $4 trillion of liquidity that we can use to support the economy,\" Mnuchin told Fox News on Sunday.\n\n\"Those are broad-based lending programs. ... We can leverage our equity working with the Federal Reserve,\" he said.\n\nThe Treasury secretary said the plan is broad-based to help small and large businesses \"get through the next 90 to 120 days,\" he said.\n\nMnuchin said he thought the bill would be finished Sunday and ready for a vote on the Senate floor on Monday.\n\nThe bill would also include:\n\n* Small-business retention loans aimed at helping companies keep workers on their payrolls. This will cover about half the workforce, Mnuchin said. Payments will include two weeks' worth of cash flow and some overhead. The loans will be forgiven if workers are not laid off.\n\n* Checks for Americans. The average check for a family of four will be $3,000, the Treasury secretary said.\n\n* Enhanced unemployment insurance for people who are laid off due to the pandemic.\n\nSome Fed watchers expressed caution about the $4 trillion estimate.\n\nMnuchin said that if the virtual shutdown of the American economy lasts longer than expected, Congress would pass another rescue package.\n\nEmerging from a meeting with Mnuchin on Saturday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, told reporters that Congress would appropriate up to $500 billion to the Treasury Department to provide a capital buffer to the Fed,\n\nThe central bank would be able to lend multiples of any buffer, with Mnuchin's having put the estimate at $4 trillion.\n\nThe program is similar to Crapo told reporters.\n\n\"So they can do this and get a significant boost of leverage into the marketplace,\" he said.\n\nSen.

Here's how we did it  --  and what life looks like on the other side", "body": "\"Hong Kong is definitely coming back to life\" following a weeks-long coronavirus lockdown, says Adam Najberg, an American executive who's been living in the territory for over a decade. \"It's clearly not bustling, and restaurants aren't brimming with activity, but people are going out again, shopping again, walking on the streets.\"\n\n\"You have to wait a bit for taxis, people are back on the subway and buses. Traffic is back, [the] subway is getting more crowded again, [and there's] more foot traffic, too.\"\n\nNajberg spoke with MarketWatch via Facebook Messenger to describe his recent experiences in Hong Kong, and how the Chinese territory has dealt with the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"It was tense six weeks ago,\" he said. \"Uncertainty about how bad it might be was hanging over folks, especially those remembering SARS. Now, honestly, my two biggest personal concerns are about my kids in the U.S. and whether there is Diet Coke in the vending machine. The U.S. doesn't get this, and the years of polarization and complacency and comfort lull people into not taking this seriously enough.\"\n\nHong Kong is getting through this because the territory went to an emergency lockdown to stem the growing COVID-10 outbreak for three weeks in January and February, Najberg said. While the coronavirus has not been eradicated in Hong Kong, the territory has managed to severely slow the spread of the illness. According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker, Hong Kong has had a total of 155 confirmed cases, out of a population of 7.4 million.\n\nNajberg said had to work from home for a few weeks. \"Everyone masked up, work from home was implemented, [and] many companies have alternating shifts of staffers at the office, even though we're back now,\" he said. The territory did an enormous number of tests and quarantined the sick.\n\n\"Many companies followed the government's lead -- [civil] servants, except for critical and health services, worked from home. Buildings and compounds -- and individual companies -- put [their] own containment and safety measures in place, too. My gym in my compound shut temporarily. The club restaurant delivers, but they stopped dine-in service. I joined another gym temporarily, paying their fee. They have temperature checks in place and scrub every surface religiously after equipment use.\"\n\n\"Its peak looks to have passed here. They've done a pretty solid job containing it. When you read the stories, it's a bit crazy how they cherchez le virus.\"\n\nMeanwhile, much of the rest of the world is in chaos or bracing for impact.\n\nSo what is the new normal on the other side of this thing?\n\n\"We came back to the office in shifts, not everyone at once,\" Najberg said. \"We all fill out daily health-check surveys online. They take about 15-30 seconds. And did it work? It worked to help ensure social-distancing. When we returned, we entered only through the doors on one floor, had our temperatures checked, stepped on a disinfection carpet outside the door and then put on a mask to go to our desks. I keep my mask on when I'm walking the floor and when I'm in public spaces. The building took over temperature checks, using a FLIR scanner at the entrance to the office towers. You don't have to stop. You just walk past the scanner and it checks temperatures. And entrances on multiple floors have reopened. We still mask up inside the office and in public spaces.\n\n\"So, did it work? So far, seems to be fine. We also adhere to Hong Kong's travel and self-quarantine policies and have our own company policies to keep those who might have been exposed and others around them safe, which means if you've had contact with someone or traveled somewhere where there is a virus risk, you do work-from-home until you're allowed back and it's clear you're not ill.\"\n\n\"You get a temple-checked thermometer reading at many places.... Hand sanitizer everywhere. Elevator buttons disinfected once an hour, offices deep disinfected once a week, etc. My building still takes my temperature every time I come back from Starbucks. Elevator buttons are covered with plastic that is disinfected every hour.\"\n\nIn the new normal, most people wear masks when they're out, Najberg said. If you go to a restaurant, you take them off only when you get inside. There is debate about how useful masks are in helping protect against the disease. Najberg said they work for another reason.\n\n\"The masks are more a sign to keep your distance. And it works. Plus, you touch your face less when wearing a mask.\n\n\"I'm told this is what SARS was like. They were not ready for SARS. My observation in returning to [Hong Kong] 10 years ago was that it was much cleaner than before. SARS led to hygiene and a major upgrade in pandemic preparedness. This is THE place to be when you have a health crisis. They are ready for quarantine. They already have several quarantine camps.\n\n\"The thing I'd say about Hong Kong, after living here nearly 10 years this time -- and 15 in total -- is that people here follow social 'protocol' and are respectful of measures to contain illness. Yes, there was some panic-buying of toilet paper, rice and noodles and some oils, but overall, it has been very orderly. People take this extremely seriously from government on down, and they listen and care about the health and safety of others, not just themselves.\"\n\nThis report is part of a MarketWatch series, 'Dispatches from the front lines of a pandemic.'", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_arends@marketwatch.com", "name": "Brett Arends", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Restaurant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vending machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinfectant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_Coke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diet Coke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traffic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_sanitizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hand sanitizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starbucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work and Family", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 48}], "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-IC394_hk0316_ZG_20200316193132.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 2133}, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 2133, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1486017027", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-16", "time": "19:33:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-16T19:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-16T19:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-win-for-gen-x-boomers-gave-us-latchkey-childhoods-that-prepped-us-for-coronavirus-quarantine-2020-03-16", "title": "A rare win for Gen X?

They behaved most similarly, which unfortunately fails to explain why COVID-19 has become a much larger outbreak, the authors said.\n\nOne theory: Emerging evidence suggests that people infected with COVID-19 might be spreading the virus without recognizing, or prior to recognizing, the symptoms. This would make disease-control measures that were effective against SARS-CoV-1 \"less effective against its successor.\"\n\nIn contrast to SARS-CoV-1, most secondary cases of the latest coronavirus transmission appear to be occurring in community settings rather than in health-care settings, the authors wrote. However, the latter are also vulnerable to the introduction and spread of COVID-19. They recommend:\n\n* Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.\n\n* Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n* Staying home when you are sick.\n\n* Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throwing the tissue in the trash.\n\n* Cleaning and disinfecting frequently-touched objects and surfaces with a cleaning spray or wipe.\n\nDispatches from the front lines of a pandemic:\n\nDispatches from the front lines of a pandemic:\n\nAs of Saturday evening, there were 304,544 confirmed cases and 12,974 deaths worldwide, according to data from the database of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering; the database also reported 91,540 recoveries.

Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on Sunday called the coronavirus bill .\n\nPresident Donald Trump, during a Sunday news conference of the coronavirus task force, said he expects a package to get completed.\n\nThe failure of the bill highlights a lack of consensus between Democrats and Republicans to coalesce around a package at a crucial time for the economy and the financial market, which has been hammered as the virus has ground business activity to a halt.\n\nTrump also said Sunday that he outbreaks in California, New York and Washington, where much of those states are on lockdown.\n\nOn top of that, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard told that he is forecasting the U.S. unemployment rate to hit 30% in the coming months as the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. \"This is a planned, organized partial shutdown of the U.S. economy in the second quarter,\" he said.\n\nBullard also said he expects an unprecedented 50% plunge in gross domestic product.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_decambre@marketwatch.com", "name": "Mark DeCambre", "type":

see if their jobs will be the next to disappear as authorities order businesses to close and residents to stay home in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. At the same time, hiring is ramping up in some sectors.\n\nSome 70,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits this week -- one of the biggest one-week increases ever. As more Americans practice social distancing to contain the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, layoffs are occurring in sectors that rely on foot traffic, such as brick-and-mortar retail, hospitality, and restaurants and bars.\n\nBut the good news is that layoffs aren't happening across the board. In fact, a wave of unprecedented demand in certain sectors is sending some employers on hiring sprees.\n\nWalmart Inc. WMT, -4.58% said this week it plans to hire 150,000 new workers. The retailer also said it would give full-time employees who are paid hourly a bonus of $300 each, and part-time hourly employees a bonus of $150 on April 2, Thursday. The Walmart jobs will be temporary at first, but many will convert to permanent roles over time, the company said.\n\nEarlier this week, Amazon AMZN, -1.85% announced plans to hire 100,000 new employees to handle as more Americans stay home.\n\nThe openings are across the U.S. in fulfillment centers, transportation operations, Amazon Go Stores, Whole Foods stores, and in deliveries. \"While most of the hires will stay with the company through at least April, we do anticipate there will be opportunities to stay with Amazon in a longer temporary or permanent role,\" an Amazon spokeswoman said.\n\nBeyond Amazon and Walmart, here are the sectors that are ramping up hiring:\n\nFood and convenience stores\n\nAs Americans flock to grocery stores to maintain their shelves are being stripped clean. In order to restock them in a timely manner grocery chains including Kroger KR, -7.05% Safeway and Trader Joe's have either increased hiring or offered bonuses to employees.\n\n7-Eleven, an international convenience chain with more than 70,000 stores, announced Friday it will be hiring as many as 20,000 store employees.\n\n\"This will provide job opportunities and ensure 7-Eleven stores remain clean and in-stock with the goods our customers need during this critical time,\" said 7-Eleven president and CEO, Joe DePinto. The company anticipates that the majority of the new hires will be used to fulfill orders on 7NOW, an on-demand delivery app.\n\nKroger is hiring 10,000 new associates nationwide across retail stores, manufacturing plants and distribution centers, Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokeswoman said. \"Candidates may apply via jobs.kroger.com and could be placed for employment within several days of applying,\" she said adding that \"Kroger's average hourly wage is $15 an hour.\"\n\nSafeway, a national grocery chain, is looking to fill 2,000 new jobs located mainly in California, the San Francisco Chronicle . (The company didn't respond to request for comment).\n\nTrader Joe's is paying bonuses to store employees amid an \"unprecedented increase\" in sales due to the coronavirus pandemic, The company did not respond to request for comment on whether they are also increasing hiring and how much they are paying employees in bonuses.\n\nDelivery services\n\nBecause more consumers are shopping online and there is a need for more drivers and remote workers to coordinate delivery logistics, Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao said.\n\nThat sector has grown the fastest over the past week, Zhao said, according to Glassdoor hiring data. Most of the job openings are for truck and delivery drivers as well as warehouse workers, he said.\n\nWhile these types of jobs may be less appealing to people who are trying to limit face-to-face contact with others, there are also a variety of supply chain analysis jobs and delivery dispatch jobs that can be done remotely.\n\n\"Obviously there is high demand in health care,\" Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, a New York-based fixed income securities brokerage firm, said. \"But that isn't something anyone off the street can do.\" Stanley predicts restaurant workers will take on delivery roles.\n\nDomino's Pizza Inc. DPZ, -7.17%, said Thursday that it's looking for full-time and part-time workers in a . This comes as many restaurants and quick-service chains have shifted to takeout, delivery, drive-thru and pick-up only.\n\nBlue Apron APRN, -29.21%, a meal kit service that delivers to homes, also announced that it is increasing capacity and hiring workers .\n\nInternet and telecommunications\n\nWhile millions of Americans, many are doing so especially in cities like San Francisco, where there is currently a shelter-in-place order.\n\nIn order to communicate virtually over platforms like Slack WORK, +5.80%, Zoom ZM, +5.47% and Google GOOG, -3.85% GOOGL, -3.90% Hangouts, high-speed reliable internet is an absolute must.\n\nDane Jasper, CEO of Sonic, a Northern California-based internet and telecommunications provider serving more than 100,000 customers, said his company has experienced a record surge in new customers. To meet the increased demand, he will likely be hiring an additional 15 employees a month to join his team of 520 employees, he said.\n\n\"With so many folks engaging in social distancing and distance learning, unlike many industries we are busier than ever before,\" Jasper said. Employees of Sonic, like other telecommunication companies, are allowed to travel freely through regions that have shelter-in-place orders because their services are deemed essential, especial for emergency communication purposes, Jasper said.\n\nThe World Small Animal Veterinary Association, which represents more than 200,000 veterinarians worldwide, is lobbying for the same status for vets.\n\n\"As part of our continuing responsibility to care for our animal patients and their owners, we call on governments to recognize all veterinary hospitals and clinics as essential businesses in any situation in which non-essential businesses are asked to close for COVID-19 risk mitigation,\" WSAVA president Shane Ryan said.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIncreased demand in the U.S. for respiratory equipment such as ventilators could cause a surge in hiring in manufacturing.\n\n\"At some point certain manufacturers will want to increase hiring so that they can make more ventilators,\" said Stanley of Amherst Pierpont. \"It's almost like a wartime operation,\" he added. In addition to hospital beds and health professionals, there may be a ventilator shortage. The breathing machines are critical to saving the lives of patients with severe coronaviruses cases.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. GM, +2.42% and Ford Motor Co. F, -3.13% both said they are \"exploring\" making ventilators amid fears the life-saving devices might become scarce in the U.S. in the COVID-19 pandemic, MarketWatch .", "source": {"uri":

"What the Family First coronavirus relief bill means for small-business owners and self-employed people", "body": "The Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires paid leave for small-business employees affected by coronavirus and includes tax relief for employers\n\nCoronavirus-related tax changes that will affect many Americans and many businesses are already on the table or about to be served up. As this column was written, Congress was working on a huge new coronavirus relief bill that will surely include a massive economic-stimulus package, and probably lots of tax changes too.\n\nHere, I'll cover coronavirus-related tax changes that are already baked in the cake: Friday's announcement from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and a new law that was enacted Wednesday.\n\nThe April 15 tax-return filing deadline was deferred three months\n\nIn , I explained that federal income-tax payments that would otherwise be due on April 15 can be deferred until July 15 with no interest or penalties.\n\nAs predicted, Mnuchin TWTR, -0.74% that federal income-tax returns that would otherwise be due on April 15 can be put on hold until July 15 without taxpayers having to submit extension requests to the Internal Revenue Service. This development clearly applies to individual taxpayers and probably to trusts, estates and corporations that use the calendar year for tax purposes too. Time will tell.\n\nWe don't yet know if filing deadlines for federal payroll-tax returns and federal estate- and gift-tax returns will also be delayed. We also don't yet know if the normal April 15 deadline for making IRA and health savings account (HSA) contributions for your 2019 tax year will be delayed. Time will tell.\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act affects small businesses and their employees -- and includes employer tax breaks\n\nPresident Trump on Wednesday signed into law the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the initial coronavirus relief bill. The new law requires small employers -- those with fewer than 500 employees -- to provide limited paid-leave benefits to employees who are affected by the coronavirus emergency. Small employers are given new tax credits and federal payroll-tax relief to pay for the new mandatory benefits.\n\nMandatory employee paid leave\n\nThe Act requires emergency paid sick leave. It is limited to $511 per day for up to 10 days (up to $5,110 in total) for an eligible employee in coronavirus quarantine or seeking a coronavirus diagnosis. An employee can also receive emergency paid sick leave of up to $200 per day for up to 10 days (up to $2,000 in total) to care for a quarantined family member or a child whose school or child-care location has been closed due to the pandemic.\n\nThe Act also requires that small-business employees be given the right to take up to 12 weeks of job-protected family leave if the employee or a family member is in coronavirus quarantine or if the school or child-care location of the employee's child is closed due to the coronavirus. The employer must pay at least two-thirds of the employee's usual pay, up to a maximum of $200 per day, subject to an overall per-employee maximum of $10,000 in total family-leave payments.\n\nSmall-employer tax credits\n\nThe Act grants a new tax credit to small employers to cover the now-required payments to employees who take time off under the new law's emergency sick-leave and family-leave provisions.\n\nSpecifically, a small employer can collect a tax credit equal to 100% of qualified emergency sick-leave and family-leave payments made by the employer pursuant to the Act. However, the credit only covers leave payments made during the period beginning on a date specified by the Secretary of the Treasury and ending Dec. 31, 2020. The beginning date will be within 15 days of the March 18 date the Act became law.\n\nThe credit is increased to cover a portion of an employer's qualified health-plan expenses that are allocable to emergency sick-leave and family-leave wages.\n\nThe new credit is first used to offset the Social Security tax component of the employer's federal payroll-tax bill. Any excess credit is refundable, meaning the government will issue a payment to the employer for the excess.\n\nWarning: The credit is not available to employers that are already receiving the pre-existing credit for paid family and medical leave under Internal Revenue Code Section 45S.\n\nSmall-employer FICA tax relief\n\nSick-leave and family-leave payments mandated by the Act are exempt from the 6.2% Social Security tax component of the employer's federal payroll tax that normally applies to wages. Employers must pay the 1.45% Medicare tax component of the federal payroll tax, but they can claim a credit for that outlay.\n\nComparable tax credits for self-employed individuals\n\nIf you are a self-employed individual who is affected by the coronavirus emergency, the Act allows you to claim a refundable credit against your federal income-tax bill, including the self-employment tax hit. If the credit exceeds your bill, the government will issue you a payment for the excess.\n\nThe credit equals: 1) 100% of the self-employed person's sick-leave equivalent amount plus 2) 67% of the sick-leave equivalent amount for taking care of a sick family member or taking care of your child following the closing of the child's school.\n\nThe sick-leave equivalent amount equals the lesser of: 1) your average daily self-employment (SE) income or 2) $511 per day for up to 10 days (up to $5,110 in total) to care for yourself due to the coronavirus or $200 per day for up to 10 days (up to $2,000 in total) to care for a sick family member or your child following the closing of the child's school due to the coronavirus.\n\nIn addition, you could claim a coronavirus emergency family-leave credit for up to 50 days. The credit amount would equal the number of qualified family-leave days multiplied by the lesser of 1) $200 or 2) your average daily SE income. The maximum total family-leave credit would be $10,000 (50 days times $200 per day).\n\nThese credits for self-employed individuals are only allowed for days during the period beginning on a date specified by the Secretary of the Treasury and ending on Dec. 31, 2020. The beginning date will be within 15 days of the March 18 date the Act became law.\n\nWarning: To properly claim the credits, self-employed individuals must maintain whatever documentation the IRS requires in future guidance. Your tax professional can help with that.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nFolks, we may see almost daily developments on the coronavirus-related tax front. We will do our best to keep you informed.

coronavirus has died two days after being released from a government quarantine having been declared virus-free.\n\nThe Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) in Hong Kong said it was notified by the owner of the 17-year old Pomeranian that the dog had died on Monday.\n\n\"The owner expressed that she didn't wish to let her dog undergo postmortem to confirm its cause of death,\" the AFCD told MarketWatch in an emailed statement.\n\nNews in February that the dog for Covid-19 sparked panic that domestic dogs and cats could be transmitters of the virus.\n\nThe AFCD had initially tested the dog on Feb. 26 and quarantined it for the standard 14 days after detecting low levels of the Covid-19 from its nasal and oral cavity samples.\n\nFive more samples were subsequently collected from the dog for tests, as well as a blood sample and the AFCD said on March 12 that the . \"The negative result indicates that there is not a strong immune response and that there are not measurable amounts of antibodies in the blood at this stage,\" the department said.\n\nThe dog's owner, a 60-year-old woman, was confirmed to be infected and hospitalized on February 25. She recovered and returned home on March 8, .\n\nThe AFCD noted that the genetic makeup of the virus found in the dog and its close human contacts were very similar. \"The sequence results indicate that the virus likely spread from the infected persons and subsequently infected the dog.\"\n\nSome animal welfare experts have suggested that dog's death could have been caused by the stress of being quarantined and separated from its owner.\n\nThe department stressed that there is currently no conclusive evidence that pet animals such as dogs or cats can spread COVID-19 or that pet animals can be a source of infection to people. \"This is, however, a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available,\" it added.\n\nBoth the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have said there is that companion animals such as cats and dogs can spread the virus. \"Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare,\" the animal health organization said.\n\nThe World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA), the professional body that represents more than 200,000 veterinarians worldwide, has to continue to wash their hands when interacting with their pets.\n\nIdexx Laboratories IDXX, -4.23%, the veterinary diagnostic company said last week that it has seen of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus strain responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 or Covid-19 respiratory outbreak in humans.\n\nThe Maine-based company evaluated thousands of canine

commissioner wants you to know you'll still get paid, but the agency is changing a few other policies in the midst of the coronavirus crisis -- and wants recipients to be aware of potential threats to their financial security too.\n\n\"The first thing you should know is that we continue to pay benefits,\" said Andrew Saul, commissioner of the Social Security Administration, in a on Thursday.\n\nThis is true whether Americans are receiving their Social Security benefits or Supplemental Security Income payments via direct deposit or mail, though they should check in with the U.S. Postal Service for any updates as well. Right now, the USPS is \"closely monitoring\" the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. The Surgeon General, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all said there's currently no evidence the disease can spread .\n\nAmericans need to be vigilant about digital threats, Saul said in his statement. \"Be aware that scammers may try to trick you into thinking the pandemic is stopping your Social Security payments but that is not true,\" he said. \"Don't be fooled.\"\n\nSee:\n\nOne way Americans can ensure they have not become a victim of fraud is to , where individuals set up accounts so they can see their personal information and work history.\n\nPeople should be wary if they've been contacted by the Social Security Administration. The agency does reach out to Americans over the phone in some situations, but one way to be sure is to ask the callers if you can call them back at their extension. Then call the SSA phone line and dial the extension.\n\nThe Social Security Administration is also closing its locations to visitors, in an attempt to stop the spreading of the coronavirus, a disease that has infected more than 236,000 people and killed another 9,800 people around the world, according to the Whiting School of Engineering's Center for Systems Science and Engineering.\n\nThe administration said all face-to-face services in its field and hearings offices will be suspended until further notice. \"This decision protects the population we serve -- older Americans and people with underlying medical conditions -- and our employees during the (COVID-19) pandemic,\" the agency said on its website.\n\nAlso see:\n\nAmericans can still get help from the SSA, though. The agency suggests looking for resources on , or calling local offices' General Inquiry lines or its national number. Individuals can apply for retirement, disability and Medicare benefits online, as well as request a replacement Social Security card in most areas and change an address.\n\nSSA agents are focusing on a few critical areas during the pandemic, according to the agency's site. It will accept requests for dire need benefit payments, including for those who did not receive their monthly payments, are currently homeless or at risk of becoming homeless or if benefits were suspended and can now be reinstated. They are prioritizing critical claims for disability applications in the most severe of circumstances, as well as Medicare and Medicaid applications.\n\nSSA has suspended processing and collection of overpayments, third-party requests for information (except from appointed representatives and representative payees) and Freedom of Information Act requests. It will also not start or complete any current medical continuing disability reviews, it said. \"We will follow up with you for any medical evidence once the COVID-19 public health emergency subsides,\" it said.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alessandra_malito@marketwatch.com", "name": "Alessandra Malito", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social Security Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social Security (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Postal Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Security_Income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supplemental Security Income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon General of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social Security number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_emergency_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health emergency (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of Information Act (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-IC668_ssagen_ZG_20200319180734.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1254}, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 1254, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6000109287", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-19", "time": "17:30:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-19T17:30:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-19T17:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/carnival-offers-use-of-its-cruise-ships-as-temporary-covid-19-care-hospitals-2020-03-19", "title": "Carnival offers use of its cruise ships as temporary COVID-19-care hospitals", "body": "Carnival Corp.

But some Wall Street veterans have a word of advice: Don't!\n\n\"First, let's acknowledge that none of us can predict when the market will bottom,\" said Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco, in a Friday note.\n\n\"The number of new COVID-19 cases will likely need to peak before we get there. That's a question for the epidemiologists to answer and a challenge for Americans and global citizens to take social distancing and/or isolation seriously,\" he wrote.\n\nCounterpoint:\n\nIn fact, for Wall Street professionals, warned Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, the temptation to make a bold market-bottom call carries serious career risk.\n\n\"Over my plus-30-year Wall Street career I have seen more friends fired or lose clients because they tried to pick a bottom than any other single cause,\" he said, in a Friday note.\n\nOf course, stocks will stop falling at some point. Even if the bear market is still far from over, history offers some reassurance for long-term investors, Levitt said.\n\n\"In fact, over the six major bear markets we observed, investors would have lost, on average, 38% between the midpoint and the bottom. Ten years later, an investor would have returned, on average 110% cumulatively from the midpoint of the drawdown,\" he said.\n\nBut the carnage accompanying in this bear market is understandably unnerving. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.08% dropped more than 17% in the past week for its worst weekly performance since the 2008 financial crisis, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.92% marked the same milestone with a 15% drop.\n\nSee:\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500, which both traded at all-time highs in February, dropped from records to a bear market -- a pullback of 20% from a recent peak -- at the fastest pace on record, and have kept falling. With Friday's close, the Dow is down 35.1% from its Feb. 12 record finish, while the S&P 500 is off 31.9% from its Feb. 19 record.\n\n\u00b0And the drop has come alongside unprecedented volatility. The S&P 500 saw a stretch of seven consecutive trading days in which the index moved up or down 4%, the longest on record. The Cboe Volatility Index VIX, -2.16%, a measure of expected volatility for the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, closed earlier in the week at an all-time high.\n\nThe stock-market volatility is part of a broader market breakdown that saw investors world-wide liquidating assets across the board in a dash for cash that saw even traditional haven assets fall and , creating a feedback loop.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and other major central banks responded with a range of stimulus measures and other efforts aimed at shoring up liquidity and ensuring markets could function. Governments weighed a range of fiscal stimulus measures on previously unthinkable scales.\n\nCheck out:\n\nAs a result, investors are witnessing historical market events for the first time together, noted Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets.\n\n\"For an investment and strategy culture and community that routinely relies on history for precedence and perspective, we believe it is safe to state that what has transpired the past several days does not have a perfect parallel to previous stock market corrections and 'shocks,' he said, in a note.\n\nThat means there \"unfortunately does not exist a magic chart, table or bullet point that will answer all questions, let alone illustrate the bottom or foretell the recovery in stocks that WILL follow this,\" Belski said. \"Regrettably, a less negative and hopefully POSITIVE stream of headlines on coronavirus (COVID19 virus) is most likely the only acceptable antidote the stock market is yearning for right now.\"\n\nIn the week ahead, investors will get a look at a range of economic data, including February durable-goods orders on Wednesday, while February consumer spending and income data is due on Friday.

That included my business, The Monster Minders, Philly's largest professional dog-walking service.\n\nI watched our only source of family income vanish in a matter of hours. Overnight, 20 of my employees watched their jobs disappear indefinitely.\n\nWe fully support the science behind social distancing. However there is no \"work from home\" option for dog walkers -- and the millions of workers in the restaurant, service, event logistics, nonessential retail, gyms, salons, and child-care industries. While everyone else is complaining about difficulties of working from home, we (and our employees) are wondering if we're going to have enough money to pay our rents or mortgages.\n\nNormally, we're in hundreds of homes each day, caring for our clients' best friends. In our 15-year history, we have completed over half a million dog walks. Nearly all of our revenue goes to payroll. Our walkers -- all employees with benefits, not independent contractors in the gig economy -- start at $18 for an hour visit and more than $10 for a half-hour visit.\n\nOn Monday night our operating revenue dropped to nothing. We have a few amazing clients who have offered to keep paying for walks for a while, but how long with that generosity last?\n\nWe will be paying employees their accrued time off over the next two weeks, but after that, what are we as business owners to do? Pay our workers? How? Service industry companies can't generate revenue when we can't provide services.\n\nI haven't yet laid off any workers. I'm still trying to figure out the best option so that we can restart as soon as the city lets us and not lose our staff.\n\nBut if this goes on for months, it will decimate our business. Like any high-touch service company, we are as much a recruiting company as we are a service company. After all, we can only walk dogs at scale if we have dog walkers to do so. Our clients love our employees, and our business model is our compassionate and experienced walkers. To lose them would be nothing short of devastation.\n\n'That is not sound business advice'\n\nSo far we have seen little in the way of practical help for small businesses and their employees beyond \"tell your employees to apply for unemployment and you take out a low-interest disaster loan.\"\n\nHonestly, taking out a loan is a risk we are not comfortable taking. We have no idea what sort of landscape we will return to when this is all over. Will we come back to 90% of our previous business if this ends in two months? If this goes on for four months, will 50% of our clients be laid off themselves and unable to rehire us? If this goes for a year, will we have any clients or employees left? Will we have to start from scratch with nothing but our reputation?\n\nTwo weeks ago, a bank would not underwrite a loan without a clear business plan. Right now, none of us can do any sort of business forecasting for what our revenue is going to look after this Covid-19 pandemic recedes, but we're being told to take out loans. That is not sound business advice. It's the government passing the buck to the very job creators that employ millions of Americans.\n\nHow can we comfortably take out a loan without knowing when we'll be able to generate the revenue needed to repay the loan? Will it be three months before we can jump-start services? Will we lift restrictions in May only to be hit with a second wave of virus outbreaks and be forced to cease operations again? Will we need to take out a second loan if that happens? Will we have to wait for a vaccine for any sort of normalcy? I fear it could take years to get our business back to where it was.\n\n\" Business owners do not qualify for unemployment \"\n\nThe small businesses of America need to be bailed out. We won't be doing stock buybacks () or (ahem, Wall Street). A cash infusion would allow me to give my fabulous team of employees (and myself) a paycheck while services are on pause indefinitely.\n\nThe would let businesses with fewer than 500 employees apply for loans to help cover payroll, salaries, rent and more, and that those who keep their payroll levels from March 1 to June 30 could have any of the money used to pay pre-existing debt and payroll costs forgiven. I'm watching this development closely and I hope the government can come to an agreement on a package that works for the realities we are facing. We cannot risk more than we already are at such an uncertain time.\n\nBusiness owners do not qualify for unemployment, and we are at risk of losing our home, all of our savings and our retirement. Small businesses and their workers are being asked to sacrifice everything for the greater good and we're willing to do so because lives are at risk. But we need support.\n\nEntrepreneurs are brave. We risk everything for a dream we believe in. To make our dreams a reality we often put all of our eggs in one basket. We are resilient and face challenges regularly, but this is unlike anything we have ever dealt with. While we can pivot, the devastation has been so immediate and so complete for many companies that it would require tearing down the very fabric of our business model to start something new. And just over half of us say our businesses won't survive beyond the next three months, .\n\nRead:\n\nService industry companies, child-care providers, retail stores, restaurants and event logistics companies are the forefront of the initial devastation. But trust me that we won't be the only ones hit. There will be second and third waves of devastation as marketing companies watch their clients (like us) slash their marketing budgets. As the manufacturing industries take a hit, all the companies that support them will start to feel the effects too. As companies like ours pull back from nonessential vendors, they, too, will watch their revenue plummet and be forced to cut costs. It will ripple throughout the entire economy.\n\nThe only difference between the millions of small businesses of America and the airlines is that we don't have lobbyists on our side. Collectively small businesses, like ours, employ nearly 50% of the American workforce. How great is that risk?\n\nWe need immediate support so I can pay my fantastic employees and we can be poised to immediately jump back into action as soon as these restrictions are lifted. Allow me to care for my employee's lives in the only way I can right now -- with a consistent paycheck and the promise of a future job. It's really that simple.\n\nCarrie Ruddell Maria is the owner, founder and CEO of in Philadelphia.\n\nNow read:\n\nAlso:", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carrie_ruddell_maria@marketwatch.com", "name": "Carrie Ruddell Maria", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Payroll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_contractor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent contractor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telecommuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Restaurant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Consulting", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-IC739_carrie_ZG_20200320145245.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1163}, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 1163, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1488456079", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-18", "time": "13:50:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-18T13:50:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-18T13:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-billionaire-to-president-trump-send-everyone-home-now-2020-03-18", "title": "Wall Street billionaire to President Trump: 'Send everyone home now'", "body": "Earlier this month, Bill Ackman his hedge fund's $6.6 billion portfolio against what he predicted to be a rough stretch for markets in the face of the coronavirus spread.\n\nThe moves proved to be prescient, considering the volatility that has slammed into stocks as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to explode across the country.\n\nNow, the Wall Street billionaire boss at Pershing Square is urging President Donald Trump to take drastic measures to tackle the outbreak head on:\n\nHe went on to tweet that there should be no defaults, no foreclosures.

Nearly two weeks ago, mortgage rates , according to Freddie Mac.\n\nIn the week after that though, interest rates on home loans as lenders moved rates up to deal with a major influx of refinance applications and to hedge for the potential that bond yields could rise were the coronavirus situation to improve.\n\nBut the latest move on the Fed's part should reverse that trend, real-estate experts said. \"With the Fed cutting rates to 0% and re-starting quantitative easing, including purchasing mortgage backed securities, mortgage rates are poised to drop back down and may even hit new record lows,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.\n\n(Realtor.com is operated by News Corp NWSA, -3.15% subsidiary Move Inc., and MarketWatch is a unit of Dow Jones, which is also a subsidiary of News Corp.)\n\n\" Last summer, Denmark's Jyske Bank began offering a 10-year fixed-rate mortgage at negative 0.5%. \"\n\nThat doesn't mean rates are going to drop to zero. Over the past year, other countries have seen the emergence of ultra-low and even negative mortgage rates.\n\nLast summer, Denmark's Jyske Bank at negative 0.5%. Around that same time, Finland-based Nordea Bank started originating a 20-year fixed-rate mortgage in Denmark that charges no interest.\n\nAlso see:\n\nLow and negative mortgage rates in Denmark only came about after the country's central bank had kept interest rates near zero for many years. \"It would take a lot of big changes for the U.S. to have negative interest rates,\" Kate Warne, investment strategist and principal at Edward Jones, told MarketWatch in August.\n\nIndeed, this is not the first time the Fed has dropped its benchmark rate to zero. Rates were held at that level between December 2008 and December 2015 to help the U.S. economy weather the Great Recession. Even through all of that, the median mortgage rate was 4.2% during that time period, Hale noted.\n\nAnd even if Treasury yields were to fall to the same level as the federal funds rate, mortgage rates likely wouldn't follow.\n\n\"Because mortgage bonds are considered riskier than government bonds, they tend to be slightly higher than 10-year rates,\" Hale said. \"Even if the market spread were to return to normal, given where 10-year rates have been in the last week or so, we're looking at mortgage rates around 2.5%.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title":
