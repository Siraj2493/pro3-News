Rather it's a piece of news \"analysis\" with the headline \"Coronavirus task force another example of Trump administration's lack of diversity.\"\n\nAt the top of the piece, CNN posts a photo from a Trump tweet of the task force. It's all white people.\n\nBelow, CNNLOL juxtaposes the Trump Team photo with a photo of President Obama's 2014 Ebola task force, which includes three black people: Barry, serial liar Susan Rice, and Jeh Johnson.\n\nCNNLOL laments:\n\nIt's a statement that's as predictable as it is infuriating: President Donald Trump's administration lacks diversity.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump tweeted photos of a briefing he'd received on the new coronavirus spreading out of China.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the ongoing developments,\" the President said in his post. \"We have the best experts anywhere in the world, and they are on top of it 24/7!\"\n\nWho are these experts? They're largely the same sorts of white men (and a couple women on the sidelines) who've dominated the Trump administration from the very beginning.\n\nBy contrast, former President Barack Obama's circle of advisers in the face of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was hardly so monochromatic. Neither was it so abysmal in terms of gender diversity. (Of course, to contextualize, Obama's administration, on the whole, was far more diverse than Trump's.)\n\nBut the whole thing is just a lame troll, and a poorly thought out one at that.\n\nWhere's the reporting?\n\nWhat I mean is, where are the facts laying out the case this task force is not up to the job, or that the president not bringing on this super-qualified black expert or that super-qualified black expert means we're all gunna die?\n\nCNN doesn't even try to make the case that bringing on Morgan Freeman will calm America and Americans through the reassuring presence of his soothing gravitas.\n\nSo all CNN is saying is, I want black people on this task force because black people 'n stuff.\n\nAnd after the Obama administration's total bungling of the Ebola outbreak, CNN is actually hurting its own cause with a photo that only brings back some very bad memories of Barry's laughable Ebola incompetence.\n\nAs long as everyone is competent, I don't care what color the task force is. Competence should be the only qualification. If you're criticizing the makeup of this task force on any issue other than competence, then you're just a sad, little troll, another puppet controlled by that sad, little troll called Jeff Zucker.\n\nAnd what a sad little life one must lead to worry about such shallow and pointless things as pigmentation.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_nolte@breitbart.com", "name": "John Nolte", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Troll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeh_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeh Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet troll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebola virus disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_African_Ebola_virus_epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western African Ebola virus epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zucker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puppet state"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace_Discrimination", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace Discrimination", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/coronavirus-1.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5475535", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 341}, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 341, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1425377052", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-27", "time": "18:06:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-27T18:06:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-27T18:03:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/01/27/stocks-drop-around-globe-on-heightened-fear-of-wuhan-corona-virus/", "title": "Stocks Drop Around Globe on Rising Fears of Wuhan Coronavirus", "body": "U.S. stock indexes fell after Monday's opening amid rising worries about the viral outbreak that started in Wuhan, China.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 440 points, or 1.52 percent.

Wuhan, China, the epicenter of a viral outbreak that has killed over 80 people so far, told Chinese state television on Sunday that five million people left the metropolis before he imposed a travel lockdown last week.\n\nScientists studying the new virus, believed to be part of the same family of coronaviruses as the one causing the Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, believe it is highly contagious even before carriers show symptoms. The symptoms are similar to traditional signs of the flu, including cough, difficulty breathing, and fever.\n\nReports indicate that Chinese authorities had reason to believe a viral outbreak had begun as early as a month ago, but they only made public the revelation that the outbreak was caused by a previously undetected virus last Monday. Zhou confirmed that the government indeed had information that should have triggered preventative public health measures earlier than his administration took them, lamenting the unsatisfactory government response to the outbreak.\n\nMayor Zhou Xianwang offered to resign on Sunday if the Communist Party deemed it necessary.\n\nZhou told CCTV, at a press conference where he wore a protective mask, that the five million who left largely did so as a product of traditional travel for Lunar New Year, which took place on Saturday. Wuhan is typically home to 11 million people and contains a large college campus, making it a common new home for students and transplants from more rural communities to move to. After the lockdown, Zhou said nine million people remained in the city, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nZhou called the decision to impose a full lockdown on the city unprecedented but necessary to contain the spread of the virus to elsewhere in China. The lockdown canceled all flights into and out of Wuhan's airport, shut down all public transportation, and placed roadblocks on major roads out of the city to ensure a halt in the free flow of traffic.\n\n\"Maybe Wuhan officials will be nailed by history with a bad reputation for doing so and locking up the virus inside the city,\" the Morning Post quoted Zhou as saying, \"but as long as it helps contain the coronavirus, we are willing to take whatever responsibility ... including the resignation of Wuhan Party Secretary Ma Guoqiang and myself.\"\n\nZhou reportedly went on to grade himself for the press conference, giving himself an 80 out of 100. Chinese state propaganda outlet Global Times, diligently working to redirect blame for the poor response to the outbreak away from dictator Xi Jinping and towards local officials, claimed that the online response to Zhou's press conference was to deem it a \"disaster, noting that the Wuhan mayor seemingly had put on his mask upside-down, then could not provide an exact number for medical supplies amid the public health crisis, thereby exposing significant holes in local governance.\"\n\nThe Communist Party controls all social media activity, censoring comments that it does not approve of and often arresting and imprisoning those who make the remarks. When the Global Times attempts to frame social media comments as a legitimate metric of public opinion, it never notes that Chinese people are not allowed to make comments the newspaper disagrees with.\n\nZhou's comments follow the latest estimates on the outbreak tallying nearly 3,000 patients infected by the virus worldwide, nearly all of them in China. Over 1,400 people carrying the virus are located in Hubei province, for which Wuhan serves as a regional capital; authorities have identified six cases in North America and 33 elsewhere in Asia. All deaths have occurred in China; health officials have identified 81 people dying from coronavirus-related pneumonia.\n\nOver 90 percent of Chinese provinces have documented cases of the new virus, including Xinjiang, the far west province home to the nation's Muslim concentration camp system.\n\nScientists suspect that the official numbers as tallied by the World Health Organization (WHO), which is relying on China to be honest about its documented cases, are significantly deflated. Wuhan officials failed to take necessary precautions to stop the spread of the virus like isolating suspected patients in hospitals, as Chinese officials told local doctors, falsely, that the virus could not spread from person to person. Wuhan also hosted a banquet for 130,000 people, an annual tradition during Lunar New Year, in an attempt to break world records.\n\nReports have also surfaced of pneumonia deaths that the government refused to document as related to the virus. One particularly suspicious death was that of environmental activist Xu Dapeng, who died in Wuhan of pneumonia last week. His wife also died of pneumonia ten days before officials announced his passing. Sources close to the family told Radio Free Asia that the couple's daughter attempted to get tested for coronavirus at a Wuhan hospital and doctors turned her away, stating only those patients hospital officials approve can get testing. Doctors also reportedly did not test the dead couple for carrying the virus despite symptoms similar to those of people carrying it.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has attempted to save face by deploying the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to Wuhan to help contain potential patients. Premier Li Keqiang, dictator Xi Jinping's deputy, also visited Wuhan on Monday to help boost the morale of health workers there.\n\nChinese officials also announced that the Lunar New Year holiday would be extended to February 2, allowing people the chance to not have to leave the house and potentially spread the disease. The extension adds only two days to the holiday.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com", "name": "Frances

"body": "Government health workers in China are actively refusing to test likely cases of the newly discovered coronavirus originating in central Wuhan city, a report claimed on Monday, echoing witness accounts that Wuhan hospitals turned them away despite displaying telltale signs of infection.\n\nChinese doctors revealed on January 20 that a new strain of coronavirus, the same grouping of viruses as the one responsible for the deadly 2003 outbreak of Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), had begun spreading in Wuhan, likely from the consumption of wild animal meat. The revelation occurred nearly a month after authorities shut down the wild game and seafood market believed responsible for selling the meat in question, leading many to wonder what took so long to warn local health officials and civilians.\n\nBy Tuesday, authorities had identified 4,682 cases of novel coronavirus worldwide, the overwhelming majority of them in China. Of those infected, 106 people have died, all in China. Europe, North America, and Australia have all identified cases, but none in critical condition.\n\nViral infection is typically accompanied by flu-like symptoms: fever, difficulty breathing, and coughing, among others. These symptoms, particularly in sensitive patients, cause pneumonia, which can lead to death. Chinese doctors have warned, however, there is a possibility that asymptomatic carriers are also contagious.\n\nThe Epoch Times, a U.S.-based newspaper that often focuses on human rights abuses committed by the Communist Party of China, cited interviews on Monday with an unnamed \"insider\" and an \"independent journalist\" within Wuhan, both of whom said that Chinese doctors were not testing people who requested it showing symptoms of infection. The party is significantly limiting access to testing kits, which makes it more difficult to confirm cases of novel coronavirus -- thus suppressing the official number of known cases of the disease.\n\n\"Medical personnel at these hospitals [in Wuhan] have said that the number of kits they are supplied is less than 10 percent of what they need to test patients,\" the Epoch Times noted. \"Now these hospitals claim that their responsibility at present is to provide treatment only, and they will not perform any diagnoses. Patients who are seeking a diagnosis are unable to get one and find themselves in a desperate situation.\"\n\nThe alleged \"insider\" told the newspaper that Chinese public health officials initially significantly limited testing for the virus to maintain the appearance that the outbreak was in control. When cases of the virus began surfacing internationally, Beijing was cornered into offering more realistic numbers of infection, creating an artificial surge in the number of cases.\n\n\"Initially, there were several days in a row when there was not a single confirmed patient with Wuhan pneumonia. But when other countries identified patients among people [traveling] from China, the CDC was forced to increase its reported cases,\" the \"insider\" is quoted as saying. \"That explains why all of a sudden China reported more than one hundred newly confirmed cases in a couple [of] days. They are manipulating the tally. The real number of patients is far greater.\"\n\nNow that China feels compelled to test for cases, the \"insider\" claimed that officials are cherry-picking individuals hoping to choose the ones likeliest to recover. They are actively choosing not to test health workers, as a higher number of infected workers would indicate that Wuhan did not do enough to protect them.\n\nThe Epoch Times report corroborates evidence surfacing since China first admitted the virus was spreading from other reports citing locals in the city who said hospitals turned them away. Perhaps the most high-profile such case is that of the family of Chinese environmentalist Xu Dapeng. Xu, founder of the Friends of Nature NGO -- the largest environmental group in the country -- was pronounced dead three days after China announced the discovery of the new virus. Xu's official cause of death is \"pneumonia\" -- the same as his wife, who died ten days before him. According to Radio Free Asia (RFA), Wuhan doctors refused to test him or his wife for coronavirus, then refused to test their still-living daughter, who had ample exposure to her dying parents. They have also refused to isolate Xu's daughter or anyone in contact with the dead couple, allowing for potential further contamination.\n\nRFA inquired with the local Center for Disease Control (CDC), which confirmed that only state-approved individuals can receive testing for coronavirus.\n\n\"An official who answered the phone at the Wuhan CDC confirmed that health authorities aren't taking reports of infections or deaths or isolation inquiries from members of the public, only from hospitals,\" RFA noted. \"If hospitals don't report a case as being suspected nCoV, then the relatives of the infected patients are left to their own devices, the official said.\"\n\nSimilarly, a phone call by the Epoch Times to a Wuhan hospital yielded confirmation that \"the hospital now only accepts patients who were selected and approved by the Wuhan Health Commission.\"\n\nAnother Wuhan resident, Zhang Changchun, told the Reuters news agency that he and his brother have tried to receive medical care for their mother, who exhibits clear signs of a respiratory infection, but doctors turn them away.\n\n\"My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don't get any new answers,\" Zhang said. \"Every time the responses are the same: 'There's no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what's going on.' The doctors are all very frustrated too.\"\n\nZhang's mother has not been tested for coronavirus, even though a doctor reportedly told her that she \"almost certainly\" has it, Reuters noted.\n\nChinese state propaganda outlet Global Times admitted last week that Wuhan has failed to conduct adequate testing of suspected patients, but claimed the issue was a shortage of testing kits, not a concerted effort to suppress the true outbreak numbers.\n\n\"Shortage of medical resources, especially the testing kits, keep hovering [sic] hospitals in Wuhan, capital of central Central China's Hubei Province, while the whole China is fighting together against the novel coronavirus originatinged [sic] in the city,\" the Global Times claimed. Noting a \"severe shortage\" of testing kits, the Times also confirmed that hospitals are not allowed to test for the virus without Party approval.\n\n\"The reagent [testing] kits were first sent over to local centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) in each place. For now, at least, the CDC remains [sic] the primary users of the agency controlling kits use, whereas the main task of the hospitals is are to diagnose and treat suspected and confirmed patients,\" the Times confirmed.\n\nDue to the poor handling of the situation, University of Hong Kong medical researchers warned on Monday that the true number of people infected could be closer to 44,000 in Wuhan alone than 5,000. Gabriel Leung, the dean of the university's medical school, told reporters that the virus could continue spreading into the summer and that world governments must consider \"draconian measures\" to contain it, particularly in China.\n\nDespite the ample evidence that the Communist Party failed to react quickly enough to contain the virus, World Health Organization (WHO) Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the Party during a visit to Beijing on Tuesday for its \"decisive measures\" and recommended against foreign states evacuating its citizens from China.\n\n\"After the outbreak of pneumonia, China identified the pathogens in record time, shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus with the WHO and other countries, and carried out a series of effective measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus,\" Ghebreyesus said, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.\n\n\"Tedros said the WHO and the international community speak highly of and fully affirm the decisive measures the Chinese government has taken, and appreciate China's great efforts in curbing the spread of pneumonia,\" Xinhua added.\n\nThe WHO, at China's behest, has for many years banned Taiwan from participating in any global public health efforts despite its wealth and advanced technology. Taiwan has documented seven cases of coronavirus at press time and made a request to the WHO, a United Nations body, to be allowed to partake in the response.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com",

Zero Hedge noted that the laboratory recently called for applicants to help study \"bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.\"\n\nBecause of this, Zero Hedge asserted a link between the virology institute and the outbreak of the coronavirus.\n\nBoth the name of the scientist and details about his and the Wuhan Institute of Virology's work studying coronaviruses was publicly available on the internet, and circulating widely on social media prior to Zero Hedge's article.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "allum_bokhari@breitbart.com", "name": "Allum Bokhari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Hedge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zero Hedge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ebola virus disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/02/twitter-broken-reuters.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5482903", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 17}, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 17, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1429439105", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-30", "time": "20:10:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-30T20:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-30T20:07:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5490196347236633, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/01/30/coronavirus-uk-foreign-office-tells-brits-in-china-to-get-out-while-they-still-can/", "title": "Coronavirus: UK Tells Brits in China to Get Out While They Still Can", "body": "The UK Foreign Office is anticipating the Chinese government enforcing further travel bans on the country and is consequently advising British citizens to get out the country before it is too late.\n\nWhile the Chinese government has come under fire for its initially slow response to the outbreak of Coronavirus in the city of Wuhan, it appears to be attempting to make up for lost time now, with sweeping authoritarian measures that have seen tens of millions of residents in several cities placed on near or total lockdown.\n\nWhile ordinary citizens have had their ability to travel by road, train, and air removed, the small number of foreign citizens living and working in these areas are being repatriated by their home governments, with chartered flights from several nations around the world flying in and out of locked-down areas. Many nations are putting these citizens directly into quarantine upon their return, and up to 300 British citizens are expected to be flown home and moved into a military base for two weeks of observation and treatment today.\n\nBut the time available to get out of China is limited, the government believes, and the new advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in London to Britons abroad is to get out of China while they still can.\n\nWhile up to this point the FCO has advised against all but essential travel to China, that advice seems to have evolved, with a spokesman quoted by British newspaper The Times saying: \"It may become harder over the coming weeks for those who wish to leave China to do so. If you feel that you may want to leave China soon, you should consider making plans to do so before any further restrictions may be imposed.\"\n\nWhile flights by flag carrier airline British Airways to and from China have now been suspended, the repatriation flight today has been chartered by and paid for by the British government, meaning there is no cost to stranded Britons stuck in China taking it. Despite the flight having been organised by the British government it was prevented from taking off on Thursday, the BBC reporting the aircraft had not been given permission to fly by the Chinese government.\n\nThe official Chinese government death toll of the Wuhan Coronavirus reached 170 overnight, with 7,711 confirmed cases in every region of the country.

Chris Pappas (D-NH) in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District -- is calling for a total travel ban from China to shield Americans from contracting the coronavirus.\n\n\"The communist government of the People's Republic of China is clearly incapable of keeping their own citizens safe and unable to control the recent deadly outbreak of coronavirus,\" Mowers said in a statement. \"With some cases of Coronavirus suspected here in New Hampshire, I urge the President to consider using all available options, including halting flights and other forms of travel from China in order to protect our country from this dangerous, infectious disease.\"\n\n\"With the spread of this disease, any non-critical travel from mainland China to the United States poses an unnecessary risk,\" Mowers said. \"We must do everything we can to keep Americans safe.\"\n\nThree of the congressional district's four counties voted for Trump in the 2016 election, making it a highly competitive House race this year.\n\nBognet and Mowers' push for a travel ban comes as Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) have urged Trump to implement a plan to restrict travel from China.\n\nAlready, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has advised Americans to avoid all non-essential travel to China, and airlines have started canceling all flights to and from China to stop the spreading of the coronavirus.

"The Chinese healthcare system is in shambles,\" stated a board certified physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and author of Make America Healthy Again: How Bad Behavior and Big Government Caused a Trillion-Dollar Crisis, in an interview on Friday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.\n\nWhile discussing the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in China, Saphier said, \"[Chinese authorities] want to maintain a positive light in public opinion. Their government-run media concerns me in the sense that they are posting pictures of nurses helping patients, but the Chinese healthcare system is in shambles. They are low on doctors, there is over-utilization of emergency rooms, [and] there's violence against healthcare workers. They're putting out this picture of harmony, but the truth is I know that the healthcare system there is terrible and they are lacking stuff for contact precautions.\"\n\nWeeks ago, Chinese children were treated with substandard and expired vaccines by China's medical authorities. Breitbart News reported, \"A crowd of angry Chinese parents gathered outside the Licheng Health Center in Jiangsu province on Friday and demanded answers about the seemingly bottomless vaccine scandal that saw thousands of children receiving substandard or expired doses of vaccine.\"\n\nSaphier said, \"If you you've been to China or in contact with people who've recently traveled to China, get tested.\"\n\nLISTEN:\n\nSaphier reflected on the Chinese government's conduct during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak in China.\n\n\"[Chinese authorities] were not very forthcoming with information when it came to SARS, which is why that became such a bigger outbreak than it needed to be,\" Saphier recalled. \"The communist-run government was trying to hide a lot of the information and keep it hidden from the world. Luckily, they're not doing that with the coronavirus right now. They are choosing what goes into their media, as they do, but it does seem that they're being more forthcoming with information, and now that the World Health Organization has declared an emergency, they are going to have to be even more forthcoming in the future to make sure that it does get under control.\"\n\n\"The way [China] handled SARS was very inappropriate, [but] they are handling coronavirus,\" Saphier added. \"The fact that the first reported case was December 31st, and they've already sequenced the virus in less than a month, that is infinitely better than what happened with SARS.\"\n\nChina lacks sufficient supplies of basic medical consumables, Saphier stated.\"This virus is in droplets, so when you sneeze [or] cough, that's how it can get contracted.

It canceled all travel to and from China for the next two weeks and said that employees at Stockdorf are free to work from home this week.\n\nGermany is the second European country to report a confirmed case of the virus. Authorities in France confirmed three cases in recent days - all Chinese citizens who recently traveled there.\n\nThe new type of coronavirus has infected thousands of people in China. Nearly all of the cases outside China are among people who recently arrived from there.\n\nBavarian authorities are working to figure out whom the patient had been in contact with and also set up a hotline on Monday for concerned people. Bavaria's state health minister, Melanie Huml, said authorities are considering whether it makes sense to take people's temperatures at airports.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType":

Vulnerable", "body": "An internationally known virologist with a military background explained to Breitbart News the United States is vulnerable to potential pandemics due to production of vaccines overseas and a lack of interest in making significant changes to the National Pandemic Plan.\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread, Steven Hatfill, MD, a virologist with master's degrees in microbial genetics, radiation biochemistry, and experimental pathology, said there are precautions the U.S. can take to improve its preparedness for a potential pandemic.\n\nHatfill does not put his faith in large bureaucratic organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\"The WHO are useless,\" he told Breitbart News in a telephone interview. \"These are the same people who gave us the 2014 Ebola pandemic. Absolutely useless. The bureaucrats are subject to the wishes of their subscribers - China puts pressure on them.\"\n\n\"And they admit it. They admitted the other day that, yes, they delayed too long,\" he said. \"I don't listen to anything they say.\"\n\nAs Breitbart News reported Wednesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus blamed \"human error\" for the U.N. agency's initial decision to minimize the global threat of the deadly coronavirus.\n\nFor the U.S., Hatfill said the next seven to 14 days are critical.\n\n\"I had thought because we hadn't had any new cases in the U.S. in days, my goodness, could we have dodged a bullet?\" he continued. \"And, now, we have a case in Chicago in the last couple of days.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first case of the coronavirus that has been transmitted from human to human in the U.S. in Chicago. The patient lives with a woman who had been diagnosed with the virus after she visited Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the infection.\n\nHatfill said one of the major problems for the U.S. is that vaccines used in this country are made overseas.\n\n\"Because it's cheaper,\" he said. \"You think the British are going to give us a vaccine? Before they vaccinate their own people?\"\n\nHatfill complimented President Donald Trump, however.\n\n\"The president is a smart cookie,\" he observed. \"Last year, he signed some legislation to bring domestic vaccine production back to the United States, realizing that this was a national security issue.\"\n\nIn September 2019, Trump issued an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to overhaul seasonal flu vaccine production.\n\nThe White House said in a statement:\n\nUnfortunately, many of the vaccines we use today are produced overseas, using time-consuming, egg-based technology, which limits their effectiveness and makes production too slow to effectively combat a potential deadly influenza pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the U.S. making its own vaccines, Hatfill said there must be drastic changes to the National Pandemic Plan.\n\nIn November, 2019, Hatfill co-authored the book Three Seconds Until Midnight, with Robert Coullahan, CEM and John Walsh, Jr., Ph.D., that urged an effort to improve the National Pandemic Plan.\n\n\"A pandemic is nothing more than a series of local epidemics,\" he told Breitbart News. \"If a local community can handle its own epidemic, then a nation can handle its pandemic, with a little help.\"\n\n\"Here's how the National Pandemic Plan works,\" he said:\n\nThe government will do everything they can to have vaccines and give it to the States. The States will get it to the area communities. And that's where it falls apart. There's no rapid distribution plan for most local authorities. There's no medical surge planning. There's no alternate care site pre-selection and cooperative agreement. You're not going to get surrounding areas to help you.\n\nHatfill said \"low resource communities\" usually suffer the worst with outbreaks of infectious disease. These communities have the highest mortality rates and local hospitals tend to get flooded with cases, he explained.\n\n\"They have more pre-existing co-morbidities, heart disease, COPD, Type II diabetes,\" he said. \"Actually, if we had a vaccine right now, in very limited supply, these communities should probably get it first.\"\n\nThough Hatfill said what is happening in Wuhan, China - the epicenter of the current infection - could be compared to the 1918 influenza pandemic, he stressed that the seriousness of the coronavirus in the U.S. is \"not yet\" at that level.\n\n\"Even in 1918, the majority of people got better,\" he noted.\n\n\"However, when you're dealing with such an infection rate and millions of people are infected, you could see how even a small percent fatality rate could quickly become overwhelming,\" he explained. \"And, if you want an example, just look at Philadelphia in 1918. The majority of people got better. But, my goodness, entire families died, bodies were lying in the street. It looked like West Africa with Ebola.\"\n\nHatfill spelled out some of what he considers to be the major issues in the U.S. healthcare system that could be disastrous in a pandemic situation:\n\nIt becomes a question of sheer numbers when you have this amount of people. We don't have enough healthcare workers - we're 50,000 workers short. In a 1918-style event coronavirus, whatever pathogen you want to use, our local hospitals are going to have to be able to do a 200 percent increase in hospital beds, and a 400 percent increase in ICU beds. But, our local authorities are not prepared. We've got to start getting these local authorities ready for this.\n\nAsked about the recent Rasmussen poll that found 72 percent of Americans are confident in the U.S. public health system's ability to contain the spread of the coronavirus within the country, Hatfill remarked, \"Before I started my research on our book, I was confident that we would be able to handle something like this.\"\n\nHe said, however, when he began to look at the National Pandemic Plan, he was not finding an impressive blueprint, and assumed there \"must be another secret plan\" somewhere else.\n\n\"And I kept going and asking questions and found out that, yes, that was the plan,\" he explained. \"We misjudged the ability of local authorities. And things are getting worse. They're not getting better. The number of available hospital beds is dropping.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dr_susan_berry@breitbart.com", "name": "Dr.

"body": "A Hong Kong-based news outlet called Initium Media alleged on Wednesday that the Chinese Communist government is secretly cremating victims of the Wuhan coronavirus to keep the death toll down.\n\nThe official figure stood at 213 fatalities on Friday, with 9,692 infections, but skeptics have long suspected Beijing of fudging both numbers.\n\nDeutsche Welle correspondent William Yang spotted the Initium Media report, which was posted two days ago, when the official count of deaths from the virus was 113:\n\n\"So there are reasons to remain skeptical about what [the Chinese government] has been sharing with the world, because while they have been more transparent about certain things related to the virus, they continue to be sketchy and unreliable in other aspects,\" Yang concluded.\n\nYahoo News Australia noted that a Chinese nurse posted a video last week in which she claimed the real number of infections is ten times as high as the figure reported by the Chinese government. After asserting that over 90,000 people have actually been diagnosed with the Wuhan virus so far, she pleaded for people around the world to send masks and other protective equipment to China to slow the spread of the disease.\n\nYahoo quoted Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating on Thursday that the death rate from the Wuhan virus is roughly two percent. This would be worse than most flu epidemics and much worse than the early estimates for Wuhan, but not nearly as deadly as SARS, the 2003 epidemic in China that killed about ten percent of its victims.\n\nFox News observed on Friday that the number of reported Wuhan virus cases has \"increased more than tenfold in a week,\" with 99 percent of them appearing in the quarantined Hubei province. All of the deaths reported so far have occurred in China. Friday's report of 43 deaths was the highest number reported in a single day.\n\nThe integrity of the Hubei quarantine is a matter of great global concern as the infection figures rise, possibly much faster than the Chinese government is willing to admit. Reuters reported on Friday that foot traffic has been spotted crossing bridges over the Yangtze River, which serves as one of Hubei's borders. The bridges were closed to vehicular traffic, but local police explained that pedestrians are allowed to cross under \"special circumstances.\"\n\nYahoo Australia's report on the nurse who claimed there have been 90,000 infections also quoted another Chinese woman who claimed on social media that she was able to conceal an illness from airport screeners by rapidly consuming a large amount of medication shortly before she flew from Wuhan to France.\n\n\"Finally I can have a good meal, I feel like I've been starving for two days,\" the woman said on social media as she posted photos of herself dining at a gourmet French restaurant. The Chinese embassy in France reportedly hunted her down and tested her for the Wuhan virus. The tests came back negative.\n\nAs of Friday, 62 countries had announced immigration or travel restrictions on China due to the virus. Some of these restrictions target Hubei province, while others apply to the entire country. Most airlines around the world are now refusing to fly to Hubei, and a growing number are refusing to fly to China, making it necessary for the Chinese government to charter planes to return travelers stranded in other countries.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name": "John Hayward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cremation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

"body": "AFP -- France will fly home its citizens who wish to leave the Chinese city of Wuhan at the centre of a coronavirus outbreak that has sickened thousands and killed 81, the government announced.\n\nThe repatriation, via a direct flight to France, will be planned for the middle of this week, with Chinese permission, under the supervision of medical experts, Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said late Sunday after an emergency meeting of ministers called by Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.\n\nThe number could \"range from a few dozen to a few hundred,\" Buzyn said, adding that consular authorities in Wuhan were doing a headcount.\n\nThe Chinese government has sealed off Wuhan and neighbouring cities, effectively trapping tens of millions of people -- including thousands of foreigners -- in a bid to contain the spread of the virus.\n\nThe United States has also announced it would arrange a flight to evacuate personnel and citizens trapped at the epicentre of the virus outbreak.\n\nBuzyn said that on their return, repatriated French citizens would \"stay in a holding area for 14 days\", which is the estimated virus incubation period.\n\nFrench carmaker PSA said Saturday that it would repatriate expat staff and their families -- 38 people in total -- from Wuhan.\n\nWith coronavirus diagnosed in three people who had recently been to China, France is the first European country with confirmed imported cases.\n\nSix suspected cases are being analysed, Buzyn said.\n\nOn Sunday, Paris cancelled a parade for the Lunar New Year, celebrated by the city's large Chinese community, as a \"precaution\", according to mayor Anne Hidalgo.\n\nCelebrations planned for Bordeaux were also cancelled.\n\nFrance on Sunday put in place a medical team of several dozen experts at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport to take charge of arrivals with possible symptoms of infection with the contagious virus.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

"(AFP) -- The Australian government on Saturday said it would bar non-citizens arriving from mainland China from entering the country under new measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said only \"Australian citizens, Australian residents, dependents, legal guardians or spouses\" would be permitted into the country from mainland China from Saturday.\n\n\"The arrangements are being put in place through our border authorities to ensure that that can be actioned,\" he added.\n\nBorder control authorities would be able to \"step up\" processes in the next 24 hours to screen those who had departed or transited through China, Morrison said.\n\nExceptions will be made for airline crew \"using appropriate personal protective equipment\".\n\n\"We're in fact operating with an abundance of caution in these circumstances. So Australians can go about their daily lives with confidence,\" Morrison told reporters.\n\n\"We're acting here in advance of many countries in terms of when similar types of arrangements are being put in place.\"\n\nThe requirement of people arriving in Australia from Hubei province to \"self-isolate\" for 14 days was expanded from Saturday to include anyone travelling from mainland China.\n\nAustralia's foreign ministry also updated its travel advice for mainland China to \"do not travel\".\n\nThe ministry said the temporary measures do not apply to Hong Kong, and that they will be reviewed in two weeks.\n\nQantas Airways, Australia's flag carrier, said earlier Saturday it would suspend its two direct flights to mainland China -- Sydney to Beijing and Shanghai -- from February 9 because of various virus-linked international restrictions.\n\nAir New Zealand followed suit, announcing a suspension of its Auckland-Shanghai service from February 9.\n\nAustralian officials have confirmed 10 cases of coronavirus in the country so far.\n\nForeign Minister Marise Payne said plans to evacuate Australian citizens from the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan to facilities on Christmas Island to be \"agreed soon\".\n\nIt is not clear how many people have requested \"assisted departure\" but Morrison defended the Christmas Island facilities, typically used for detaining refugees.\n\nCanberra said it will make available 500,000 masks to airport staff and arriving passengers.\n\n\"There is no basis for alarm. It is important to remember the risk to Australians is currently very low. We need to keep it that way,\" the prime minister said later in a joint statement with the health and foreign ministry.\n\nAny non-citizens that arrive from Saturday \"will be subject to mandatory quarantine\" should they not agree to return to their \"port of origin\".", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

China's Coronavirus with Little Aid from World", "body": "Communist China's relentless effort to diplomatically isolate Taiwan is bearing particularly bitter fruit this week as Taiwan prepares to battle China's rapidly spreading coronavirus epidemic with limited assistance from the international community, since China has resolutely blocked Taiwanese membership in bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nTaiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang presided over a closed-door meeting on coronavirus preparedness on Thursday, telling numerous central and local agencies to prepare for a \"medium to long-term battle\" by stockpiling necessary supplies, preparing treatment centers, devising procedures to contain the disease, and taking steps to minimize the risk of contagion.\n\nAmong the most vital supplies are face masks, which help prevent the spread of disease in crowded areas. Hong Kong, which is watched closely by Taiwan in all matters pertaining to relations with China, is grievously short on masks (according to epidemiologists, so is the United States). The Taiwanese government has placed emergency orders with manufacturers to secure another four million face masks.\n\nSu made it clear that Taiwanese citizens who conceal their medical history, break quarantine, or provide inaccurate information about travel that might have exposed them to the virus will be punished. Other Taiwanese officials said criminal charges will be brought against people who spread disinformation about the virus.\n\nOfficials in Taipei expressed confidence that the risk of a coronavirus epidemic could be minimized. Travel to and from the outbreak region in China has already been restricted. Eight infected people are known to have entered Taiwan, and 27 of the people they came in contact with have displayed symptoms. One indigenous case of transmission - i.e. someone who caught the virus after being exposed while in Taiwan - has been confirmed.\n\nAbout a hundred cases of severe pneumonia are being carefully monitored to ensure they are not Wuhan coronavirus infections. Some of the people judged to be at risk of infection have been placed under a sort of loose house arrest, complete with electronic monitoring devices and strict warnings not to travel too far from home.\n\nTaiwanese doctors are concerned that they cannot obtain direct information about the spread of the Wuhan virus from the WHO since China locked them out of membership. Taiwan enjoyed observer status at WHO until 2016, when China began aggressively moving to isolate the island following the election of current President Tsai Ing-wen.\n\nOn Thursday, the Caribbean nation of St. Lucia, one of Taiwan's remaining allies, called on WHO to allow full Taiwanese participation in the coronavirus effort.\n\n\"Short-term or myopic considerations must not be permitted to impede international information exchange, consultation and collective action,\" said St. Lucia's embassy in Taiwan.\n\nJapan and Canada have also urged the WHO to give Taiwan some formal status in the organization to help combat the Wuhan virus epidemic.\n\n\"It will be difficult to maintain health and prevent further infections in this region if [Taiwan] is excluded for political reasons,\" Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo warned on Thursday.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau bizarrely dodged repeated questions from the opposition on Tuesday about supporting Taiwanese membership in WHO, accusing his opponents of \"playing politics\" merely by asking. Pressured by the opposition again on Wednesday, Trudeau said he supported restoring Taiwan's observer status with the World Health Organization.\n\nWHO Executive Director Michael Ryan said on Wednesday that \"Taiwanese experts are involved in all of our consultations\" and are \"fully engaged and fully aware of all the developments.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType":

in China, 72 percent are still confident the U.S. public health system will be able to contain its spread within the country.\n\nAccording to the survey, 72 percent of Americans \"correctly predicted\" that the coronavirus outbreak in China would spread to the U.S., including 31 percent who said it was \"very likely.\"\n\nOf those surveyed, 56 percent said they are \"personally concerned\" about the threat of the coronavirus, including 18 percent who are \"very concerned.\" However, 40 percent say they are \"not very concerned\" (31 percent) and \"not at all concerned\" (9 percent).\n\nRegardless of an outbreak in the U.S., 72 percent of those surveyed said they are \"confident\" that the U.S. public health system can handle the situation. Of the poll participants, 24 percent said they are \"not confident\" U.S. health agencies can contain the coronavirus if an outbreak occurs within the country.\n\nThe survey of 1,000 American adults was conducted January 23 and 26, 2020.

If you have reason to believe that U.S. officials are being provided with false or misleading information about the disease from Chinese government officials, I ask that you notify Congress immediately.\"\n\nCotton then noted that the administration should be considering banning travel from China to the United States to prevent spread of the disease to America's shores.\n\n\"Moreover, given China's dismal record on these matters, your Department and all relevant agencies of the U.S. Government must be proactive in planning for scenarios where this infection continues to spread,\" Cotton wrote. \"Measures such as screening all travelers from the People's Republic of China and, if necessary, banning entry to those traveling from China must be contemplated and prepared in order to keep Americans safe. It is imperative that the United States, China, and other relevant governments and international bodies cooperate to prevent this virus from becoming a pandemic. This cooperation must be conducted on the basis of facts, not the CCP's political fiction.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department has since issued a Level 4 travel advisory, \"do not travel\" for the Chinese city of Wuhan, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 3 warning, \"reconsider travel\" for the entire country.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com",

China", "body": "Author of the forthcoming book Make America Healthy Again Dr. Nicole Saphier of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center says the \"right thing\" for the United States to do amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak is to shut down all travel to and from China.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the State Department have advised Americans not to travel to China, and airlines have started canceling all flights to and from China to stop the spreading of the coronavirus. Six cases of the virus have been confirmed in the U.S. while the CDC monitors a number of suspected cases in various states.\n\nStill, President Trump has yet to implement a travel ban to and from China. In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot's Breitbart News Daily, Fox News contributor Dr. Saphier said a travel ban is necessary given China's inability to contain the coronavirus.\n\n\"I hate seeing a large communist country restricting travel because that to me, it's frustrating when the government tells you that you can or cannot do something,\" Dr. Saphier said. \"However, in this case, because they did such a poor job initially in containing the virus, the right thing to do is to stop people going in and out right now until we can have the next month or two without new transmissions happening.\"\n\nDr. Saphier said she is concerned about the U.S. and other nations rushing to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, China -- the epicenter of the coronavirus -- because quarantines are not reliable in containing viral viruses.\n\n\"The one thing that concerns me a little bit is we have the United States and we have all these other countries trying to bring out our citizens from [China] and bring them home or bring them somewhere else so that they're no longer in Wuhan, but the thing is ... we're going to bring them somewhere else and we're going to quarantine them, but the truth is, quarantines fail,\" Dr. Saphier said.\n\n\"For the most part, a lot of these places -- I think South Korea is doing self-quarantines -- they're just saying to the people, 'You just have to stay in your house. You can't go out for two weeks.' We know what that does. We saw that with measles here in New York. People don't follow rules,\" Dr. Saphier continued. \"When you tell them, 'You can't leave your house,' they're like, 'Okay, we won't. Oh, I just went to my neighbors. Oh I just went up to the store.' Not that I want to leave Americans in China to deal with this, but again, it is a viral infection ... and I don't think we should be evacuating people out at this point. If the whole purpose is to contain, that's not the way to do it.\"\n\nSo far, the U.S. has evacuated about 200 American citizens from Wuhan and have quarantined them at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California.\n\nSens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) have urged the Trump administration to immediately issue a travel ban to and from China to contain the coronavirus and stop its spreading in the U.S. -- where six cases have been confirmed.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, China has the most foreign students in the U.S. compared to all other foreign countries with nearly half a million enrolled in American universities in 2018. Likewise, giant tech corporations such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook employ thousands of Chinese-born employees who, like Chinese foreign students, take frequent trips back to China.", "source":

The same cannot be said for Tang Zhihong, the head of Huanggang's health commission. The South China Morning Post, citing the local Communist Party committee, said that the decision from above to remove Tang followed a painful interview broadcast on state media in which Tang was unable to tell reporters how many open beds the city had allocated for potentially infected patients or if the city had the resources to test all those who sought to know if they were carrying the new coronavirus.\n\nHuanggang is a city in Hubei province about an hour and a half from Wuhan. While its population is about 6 million people, slightly smaller than New York City, it is dwarfed by the 11 million living in Wuhan. Locals often commute to work from Huanggang to Wuhan. The Morning Post noted that, at 324 confirmed cases as of Thursday, Huanggang has been more directly affected by the outbreak than any other city except Wuhan.\n\nTang's reported inability to say if Huanggang had enough test kits available to document coronavirus cases follows a week in which a growing number of reports from anonymous sources on the ground in Hubei province suggested that the Communist Party is deliberately refusing to test individuals who show clear signs of the coronavirus, thus deflating the total number of cases and making the outbreak appear less severe. Chinese government-controlled media revealed that Wuhan does not have enough testing kits openly, but insider reports from the city indicate that hospitals are turning people away unless they have government permission for a coronavirus test, likely resulting in thousands of unidentified cases.\n\nAs of Thursday, the Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) have documented 8,243 cases of the new coronavirus and 171 deaths, the latter all in China. Cases of the virus have officially affected every province of China and neighboring countries such as Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and elsewhere. Outside of Asia, Italy, France, Canada, and the United States have documented cases, among others.\n\nThe virus causes several respiratory symptoms common to influenza and other viral infections, including fevers, coughing, difficulty breathing, and body aches. The virus appears to rapidly trigger pneumonia, endangering the lives of many patients. It belongs to the same category of virus as the one responsible for Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people in 2003 and also originated in China.\n\nChinese authorities notified the WHO on December 31 that they had identified a viral infection of unknown origin. On January 1, Wuhan officials shut down a wild game and seafood market believed to be where a person first ingested the virus, likely through wild meat. It took Chinese officials another 20 days to tell the world that they had evidence of a growing outbreak and Beijing only shared the new viral genome sequence on January 20. The weekend before, locals reported that the government staged a banquet for 130,000 people; sharing food in contained spaces increases the virus's ability to spread.\n\nMayor Zhou expressed frustration with this secrecy on Sunday, blaming the Communist Party for not allowing him to be open about the situation.\n\n\"On one hand, we did not reveal [information] in time; on the other, we did not use effective information to improve our work to a satisfactory level,\" Zhou said. \"Regarding the untimely disclosure, [I] hope everyone can understand. [Coronavirus] is a contagious disease. Contagious diseases have relevant law and information needs to be disclosed according to law.\"\n\nThe Global Times, a government newspaper, called Zhou's press conference a \"disaster,\" couching it in reporting on the alleged social media response to his remarks. Communist Party officials control and censor all social media, stifling any dissent they do not specifically choose to leave public. The newspaper also condemned Wuhan officials specifically for failing to address the crisis appropriately, not mentioning high-level officials in Beijing.\n\n\"It has to be pointed out that it is very regrettable that the city failed to take necessary emergency measures to prevent that many people from traveling across the country as this makes it especially difficult for the country to prevent and control the epidemic,\" the Times asserted. \"The city should face the fact that the public is strongly dissatisfied with this.\"\n\nThe Global Times also published an interview on Wednesday bizarrely applauding eight individuals arrested for posting about the virus on social media before January 20. The Wuhan police department announced shortly after the government admitted that the virus existed that they had \"handled\" eight cases of people spreading \"rumors\" on social media, and warned that anyone continuing to discuss the virus online would face legal repercussions.\n\nAfter global outrage grew against the arrests, Beijing's Supreme People's Court condemned them, followed by Zeng Guang, an epidemiologist at the top disease control center in Beijing.\n\n\"In an exclusive interview with Global Times' Editor-in-chief Hu Xijin, Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the CCDC, said those eight residents should be highly regarded as they turned out to be correct about the viral outbreak, even though the information they spread 'lacked scientific evidence,'\" the newspaper relayed.\n\n\"In retrospect, we should highly praise them. They were wise before the outbreak,\" Zeng reportedly said.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com", "name":

"body": "The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Wednesday that China deserves \"gratitude and respect\" from the international community for their efforts to contain the novel coronavirus outbreak within the country's borders.\n\nChinese state propaganda outlet Global Times reported that during a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday, Tedros praised China for the \"extraordinary steps it has taken to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.\"\n\n\"The continued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China are of course both deeply concerning,\" said Tedros.\n\n\"Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak,\" he continued. \"For that, China deserves our gratitude and respect ... China is implementing very serious measures and we cannot ask for more.\"\n\nTedros made the remarks following his visit to Beijing for a meeting with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping, on whom he lavished praise over his \"very rare\" levels of leadership.\n\n\"I was very encouraged and impressed by the president's detailed knowledge of the outbreak and his personal involvement in the outbreak,\" he continued. \"This was for me a very rare leadership.\"\n\nThe 54-year-old former Ethiopian foreign and health minister also praised China's \"transparency,\" a quality rarely attributed to the Chinese communist state known for its high levels of censorship, cover-ups, and the spread of misinformation.\n\n\"China has been completely committed to transparency, both internally and externally, and has agreed to work with other countries that need support,\" he declared, pushing back against accusations from some figures that Beijing may be playing down the numbers of those infected in order to reduce international concern and its potential knock-on effect to the Chinese economy.\n\n\"The level of commitment (of the leadership) in China is incredible; I will praise China again and again, because its actions actually helped in reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus to other countries ... we shall tell the truth and that's the truth,\" he concluded.\n\nTedros's claims were seemingly supported by the head of WHO health emergencies programs, Dr. Mike Ryan, who accompanied Tedros on his recent visit to China, declaring that authorities there had \"a laser focus\" on stopping the outbreak.\n\n\"We are at an important juncture in this event. We believe these chains of transmission can still be interrupted,\" Ryan said. \"They are taking extraordinary measures in the face of what is an extraordinary challenge.\"\n\nThe WHO is expected to make a decision Thursday on whether to declare the outbreak an international health emergency.\n\nAccording to the latest figures, at least 7344 have contracted the virus while 144 have died as a result. Sporadic cases of the virus have also been reported in 20 other countries, including Australia, France, and Canada, with many airlines suspending flights to and from China while governments including the U.S. and the U.K have issued advisories against visiting China.\n\n\"The epidemic is a demon and we cannot let this demon hide,\" Xi Jinping said this week. \"The Chinese government has always adopted an open, transparent and responsible attitude to the timely release of information on the epidemic, domestically and to other countries.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType":

These include eye protection, N-95 masks, hand sanitizers, and disinfection of surfaces, where infective virus can persist for days, when caring for a sick person, Dr. Orient noted.\n\nIndividuals and local authorities must be alert and prepared and not depend on a timely federal response, Dr. Orient stated.\n\nCDC, which currently is the only provider of definitive diagnostic testing for the coronavirus, says it is \"working with\" the World Health Organization (WHO), an agency of the United Nations.\n\nOrient noted, however, \"WHO declined to call an international emergency\" as the virus \"is circulating in China at the time of the largest annual mass migration on the planet,\" during the Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nOrient told Breitbart News, in the past, \"WHO has put out pandemic warnings that turned out to be way overstated for a couple of influenza-type outbreaks or, perhaps, even SARS, that turned out to be not a cause of dismay for great numbers, and those were forgotten about.\"\n\n\"They can err in either direction,\" she added. \"Some of that is because it is so difficult a situation. But the whole idea that China has the biggest quarantine effort in all of human history, trying to shut down traffic in and out of more than a dozen major cities,\" points to a situation of dire concern, she said.\n\nWHO provided this explanation for its decision not to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC):\n\nOn 22 January, the members of the Emergency Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but the Committee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should be reconvened in a matter of days to examine the situation further.\n\nChinese authorities presented new epidemiological information that revealed an increase in the number of cases, of suspected cases, of affected provinces, and the proportion of deaths in currently reported cases of 4% (17 of 557). They reported fourth-generation cases in Wuhan and second-generation cases outside Wuhan, as well as some clusters outside Hubei province. They explained that strong containment measures (closure of public-transportation systems are in place in Wuhan City, as well as other nearby cities). After this presentation, the EC was informed about the evolution in Japan, Republic of Korea, and Thailand, and that one new possible case had been identified in Singapore.\n\nThe Committee welcomed the efforts made by China to investigate and contain the current outbreak.\n\nSeveral members considered that it is still too early to declare a PHEIC, given its restrictive and binary nature.\n\nThough several Chinese cities have now been quarantined, Orient observed to Breitbart News such quarantine of entire cities has not occurred since medieval eras.\n\nCiting a report in the medical journal The Lancet, Orient noted that, of 41 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, \"patients were relatively young (median age 49) and fewer than half had an underlying illness.\"\n\n\"Only 66% had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the apparent source of the infection,\" Orient said. \"One patient (2%) had no fever; all had pneumonia; 29% had severe respiratory distress syndrome; and 12% had acute cardiac injury. Most cases may be very mild, facilitating more rapid spread.\"\n\nOrient observed:\n\nThe corona virus is transmitted by droplets coming into contact with mucous membranes, including the eye. It can persist on surfaces for days. People without fever or symptoms can transmit the illness during the incubation period, which might be as long as two weeks.\n\n\"Panic is never helpful; staying calm is always good advice,\" she said. \"But failure to heed previous warnings of the need for robust disaster planning, and complacency about medical technology and governmental resources, has set the stage for potential unprecedented disaster.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dr_susan_berry@breitbart.com", "name": "Dr. Susan Berry", "type":
