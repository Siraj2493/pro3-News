Deceptively Edit Trump Quote on Medical Ventilators", "body": "At least eight New York Times authors shared a deceptively edited quote Monday from President Donald Trump's recent call with state governors, creating the false impression that the president is denying federal support for ventilators that are needed in hospitals treating coronavirus patients.\n\nIn his message, the president recommended that states procure respirators and ventilators because it would be faster -- but added that the federal government \"will be backing you.\"\n\nThe Times journalists omitted the bulk of the president's statement as they shared the story on social media. The misleading, partial quote was also boosted by a CNN correspondent and became the lead headline at the left-wing Huffington Post.\n\nDespite growing online backlash to this misinformation, the journalists have yet to delete or retract their comments.\n\nThe eight journalists tweeted a link to a Times article published Monday that contains President Trump's full statement to state governors in which the president recommended that they shouldn't wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators needed to treat people with coronavirus.\n\n\"Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment -- try getting it yourselves,\" President Trump told the governors during the Monday conference call. \"We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.\"\n\nBut in the body of their posts, the Times journalists left out most of what the president said.\n\nTimes national correspondent Julie Bosman tweeted only the first third of the president's statement, leaving out the part where he said the federal government will back the states.\n\nBosman, reacting to intense backlash, defended herself by inaccurately claiming that \"the second part of the quote repeats the first part, twice.\" In fact, the second part of the president's statement says that the federal government \"will be backing you [the states].\"\n\nMara Gay, a member of the Times editorial board, also left out most of what the president said. She also falsely accused the president of telling governors that \"they are on their own.\" In actuality, the president said in his full quote that the federal government \"will be backing you.\"\n\nJust ten days ago, Gay was involved in another embarrassing episode for corporate media, where she and MSNBC anchor Brian Williams horribly botched basic math to claim that billionaire Michael Bloomberg could have \"given every American a million dollars.\" In reality, the amount he spent amounts to less than $2 per person.\n\nOther Times journalists who tweeted out only the first part of the president's quote include chief White House correspondent Peter Baker, Northwest reporter Mike Baker, arts reporter Michael Cooper, investigative reporter Sharon LaFraniere, editor Clifford Levy, and contributor Aaron E. Carroll.\n\nThe official Times twitter account also omitted the majority of the president's quote when it pushed out the article on Monday.\n\nCNN's Oliver Darcy also shared the incomplete quote and has not addressed the dozens of fact checks in response.\n\nAll of the posts were still up at the time of this writing, despite mounting criticism about their accuracy.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_ng@breitbart.com", "name": "David Ng", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respirator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Respirator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point of sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Baker_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Baker (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bloomberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bloomberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Correspondents'_Association", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Correspondents' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Quotations", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/GettyImages-547524708-nyt-headshots.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5603941", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 28836, "pinterest": 12}, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 28848, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6002791336", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-21", "time": "22:50:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-21T22:50:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-21T21:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8784313797950745, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/21/illinois-governor-lists-gun-stores-as-essential-exempts-them-from-forced-shutdown/", "title": "Illinois Governor Lists Gun Stores as 'Essential,' Exempted from Shutdown", "body": "When Illinois Gov.

This is a good example and could be applied more, Song said.\n\nThis is almost as dishonest a framing of the February laser incident, and others like it, as the Chinese fairy tale about a U.S. Army lab developing the coronavirus. The Chinese laser attack on a U.S. Navy aircraft flying over international waters on February 17 was unprovoked, unprofessional, unsafe, and a clear violation of both maritime law and safe-conduct policies for the region endorsed by Beijing.\n\nThese EMP threats were prompted by the most recent series of U.S. Freedom of Navigation operations (FONOP) in the South China Sea, which essentially involve sailing through waters claimed by China to demonstrate that international freedom of navigation will be protected. The Chinese are particularly exercised by the presence of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group in the region, and while the Global Times did not explicitly mention it, the USS Theodore Roosevelt's visit to Vietnam was deeply troubling to Beijing.\n\n\"This is the third time in just a week US warships are known to have trespassed into the South China Sea: US guided missile destroyer McCampbell on March 10 trespassed into China's territorial waters in the Xisha Islands, and amphibious assault ship America and littoral combat ship Gabrielle Giffords sailed in operations in the South China Sea on Friday,\" the Global Times complained.\n\n\"Xisha Islands\" is China's name for the Paracel Islands, which the guided-missile destroyer USS McCampbell sailed near on March 10. Vietnam and Taiwan both have claims in the Paracels. The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) claimed it \"warned\" the American ship to leave, while the U.S. Navy said the ship completed its \"security and stability operations\" normally.\n\nUSS America and USS Gabrielle Giffords conducted joint operations in the South China Sea on Friday to test unified command and control and practice tactical maneuvers. The ships do not appear to have ventured into the waters claimed by China.\n\n\"By combining America's lethality provided by the Navy-Marine Corps Team with the speed and maneuverability of a littoral combat ship, we're forging new ways to operate together in one of the most important regions in the world,\" Expeditionary Strike Group 7 commander Rear Adm. Fred Kacher said.\n\nThe PLA pulled a few deliberately provocative maneuvers of its own on Monday, sending a flight of warplanes across the Taiwan Strait in a rare night exercise. The Taiwanese scrambled their own fighters to \"shadow, intercept, and disperse the Communist warplanes,\" according to Taiwan's defense ministry.\n\nThe South China Morning Post quoted analysts who said Beijing wanted to send one of its periodic threats to Taiwan while also demonstrating the coronavirus epidemic has not weakened the PLA:\n\n\"In addition to enhancing all-weather capability of its military fleet, the communist warplanes' fly-by is aimed at sending out the message that it is business as usual with PLA war games despite the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China,\" said Alexander Huang Chieh-cheng, a professor of international affairs and strategic studies at Tamkang University in Taipei.\n\nHe said the PLA's night drill was also aimed at testing the response of forces such as the United States and telling them that the mainland's air force can carry out night-time combat operations.\n\n\"Of course, it is also aimed at intimidating Taiwan,\" Huang said.\n\nThe Global Times portrayed the night exercise as a warning to Taiwan that will become more frequent if \"secessionist forces remain stubborn and continue their secessionist activities.\"\n\nThe Chinese state newspaper curiously quoted only Taiwanese sources about the incident, but slipped in a comment from an unnamed \"military expert\" who said Monday's flight was unprecedented proof that the PLA \"is fully capable of launching military operations on the island at any time of a day.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

That is always the case, but it is especially true in the sudden global emergency we face today.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported last year that 3.5 million Americans are employed as truck drivers. Many work long hours, and a disproportionate number of them are military veterans.\n\nMajor national crises tend to expose underlying truths about society that otherwise go unnoticed during life's regular routines. They reveal the individuals among us who are truly essential to upholding the high standard of living we've collectively come to expect. They remind us of America's unsung heroes.\n\nThe unfolding COVID-19 pandemic is no different. The spread of Coronavirus in the U.S. will test government institutions, challenge private industry and place inordinate demands on our most critical workforce. It will marshal the full strength of our nation and elevate its essential core.\n\nAnd just as they do when a hurricane strikes or a blizzard hits, America's professional truck drivers will be on the front lines delivering critical supplies and aid to fellow citizens.\n\n...\n\nOver the past week, Americans have rushed to stock up on goods as they prepare to hunker down to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We've watched schools, businesses, major sports and other cultural pillars come to a complete stop as personal health and well-being take top priority.\n\nBut one thing that won't stop: trucking.\n\nFor the past few years, it became fashionable to talk about the advent of self-driving trucks, as technology improved and automation seemed inevitable. But in 2018, Uber abandoned its self-driving truck project, and other companies have also hit snags in development.\n\nThe idea is not impossible, and may even become necessary if, theoretically, too many truckers are sick to take to the roads.

To take in the reality of our situation as it stands right now...\n\nAll of America's performers, all of our stars and celebrities are locked down at home. And other than releasing videos that prove just how unimpressive they are without make-up artists and CGI, that prove how tone deaf they are without that Milli Vanilli Magic, we hardly even remember them.\n\nAnd most of us, after seeing those videos, sure would like to hardly remember them even more.\n\nYep, right now we are learning that these people do not matter.\n\nOh, we treat them like they matter. We sure as hell pay them like they matter ... but they don't.\n\nListen, no one's a bigger movie fan than yours truly, and I so appreciate how art contributes to the quality of life. But I also have a little perspective about the world.\n\nIf these celebrities want to impress me, instead of producing ear-piercing reflections of their incurable narcissism, why don't they go bag groceries, or deliver meals to the needy and elderly?\n\nIf these hacks really want to be as vital as America's truckers, as the stock boys working third-shift, as the men collecting our garbage, as the women delivering take out, as the Amazon warehouse workers, as our health care workers and law enforcement, why don't they put on protective gear and spend their days serving the countless homeless who have been camped in squalor right outside their front doors for years?\n\nAfter all, as we're seeing in their videos and tweets, it's not like America's Idle Royalty have anything better to do... But instead of doing something useful (while the rest of us still have to earn a living), and as if to prove just how goddamned unnecessary they are, they sit in their million-dollar mansions and ask everyone else to imagine how much better life would be without possessions.\n\nHey, Gal Gadot, why don't you stick your pretty head out the window of your Personal Screening Room and ask the homeless encampment within shouting distance about their thoughts on possessions?\n\nYou know what, though, in the end, none of this will matter...\n\nBecause once this is all over, we all know the stupid American pecking order will return; a pecking order where the working class who took all the risks and did all the dangerous grunt work to keep our civilization civilized, will at best be forgotten and taken for granted again, and at worst return to being the only class of people you can safely ridicule ... because Orange Man Bad.\n\nAnd those in Hollywood, who proved to be the most disposable and annoying people in the history of the world, will return to being celebrated and hailed as \"brave\" for silly fashion choices and standing up for beliefs that carry no social risk whatsoever.\n\nBut at least for now, we are rid of them, and at least for now, we are reminded of how unnecessary they are.\n\nThe people who matter in this country, who really matter, who will always matter, are not scribblers like myself, and are certainly not the performers in Hollywood and the news media... No, the men and women who matter are the ones with the most difficult, dirty, thankless, and now dangerous jobs in the world.

Check Update: U.S. Never Rejected WHO Coronavirus Tests; They Were Never Offered", "body": "CLAIM: The World Health Organization (WHO) offered the U.S. coronavirus tests and we refused them.\n\nVERDICT: False. They were never offered to the U.S., and the U.S. typically does not accept WHO tests.\n\nWhen former Vice President Joe Biden made this claim in the Democrat debate on Sunday night, Breitbart News initially rated it \"true,\" focusing on the question of whether the U.S. had declined to use WHO tests. That is true.\n\nWhat is not true, as Politifact pointed out Monday, is that the U.S. rejected the tests, because they were never offered in the first place -- not for donation, or sale, or in any other way.\n\nBiden claimed: \"We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own.\" But that is wrong.\n\nPolitifact's Jon Greenberg and Victoria Knight explained (original links):\n\nThe Biden campaign referred us to a Politico article that said the WHO shipped coronavirus tests to nearly 60 countries at the end of February, but the U.S. was not among them. That is technically correct, but it suggests that the United States would have been on the list under any circumstances.\n\nThe countries WHO helped are ones that lack the virology lab horsepower that exists across the United States. The outreach work by the Pan American Health Organization is a case in point.\n\n...\n\n\"No discussions occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States,\" said WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris. \"This is consistent with experience since the United States does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity.\"\n\n...\n\nIn this instance, this caused a lag in testing for the virus in the U.S.\n\nThere was no way to know, ahead of time, that the rapid spread of the disease, and technical glitches in the test design, meant that the U.S. would suffer a delay in testing.\n\nAs Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, noted Tuesday morning, it was no one's fault in particular that the U.S. test failed.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.

What the hell is going on?\n\nYesterday, I reported the existence of three studies, all claiming that chloroquine phosphate had proved effective in treating the COVID-19.\n\nThis has since been confirmed by a more recent open-label non-randomised clinical trial in France by Didier Raoult M.D/Ph.D et al, completed just days ago. The sample was small but the results were convincing.\n\nAs the summary reports:\n\n100% of patients that received a combination of HCQ and Azithromycin tested negative and were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment.\n\nIn addition, recent guidelines from South Korea and China report that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are effective antiviral therapeutic treatments for novel coronavirus.\n\nBut the story gets more extraordinary still. It turns out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has known since at least 2005 that chloroquine is effective against coronaviruses.\n\nIn 2005, Martin J Vincent et al published a study in Virology Journal titled 'Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.'", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_delingpole@breitbart.com", "name": "James Delingpole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chloroquine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phosphate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Azithromycin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxychloroquine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydroxychloroquine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enzyme inhibitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutrition_and_Metabolism_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutrition and Metabolism Disorders", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/Chloroquine-1.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5613017", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 8952, "pinterest": 3}, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 8955, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6003404137", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-22", "time": "14:37:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-22T14:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-22T14:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/22/who-covers-for-china-amid-virus-outbreak-not-contagious-among-humans/", "title": "WHO Spread False Chinese Government Propaganda", "body": "The World Health Organization (WHO) praised Beijing's response to the novel coronavirus in line with Chinese propagandists, at one point denying human-to-human transmission was taking place as the deadly and highly contagious disease spiraled out of control inside the communist country.\n\nWHO Twitter messages from January and February show that the United Nations body was spreading Chinese propaganda. Health officials detected the first case of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on November 17 in Wuhan, China.\n\nCommunist officials in China hid the extent of the coronavirus outbreak during the early stages of the epidemic, jailing and silencing whistleblowers, a move that allowed the virus to gain a firm hold. The ruling communist party, however, has hailed the recent slowdown of the outbreak as a sign of the superiority of its authoritarian political system.\n\nA study published earlier this month by the University of Southampton, determined that China could have prevented 95 percent of the coronavirus infections plaguing the globe if Beijing had listened to the doctor whistleblowers in Wuhan about the seriousness of the disease instead of silencing and punishing them for speaking out.\n\n\"At critical moments, officials chose to put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis to avoid public alarm and political embarrassment,\" the New York Times acknowledged in early February. China has refused to apologize for its mishandling of the outbreak during its initial phase.\n\nMeanwhile, it appears that the WHO has been covering for the ruling communist party in China.\n\nOn January 14, the day before the first case to reach the United States reportedly flew from Wuhan to Seattle, Washington, the WHO denied that the disease was spreading through human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel [coronavirus] identified in [Wuhan],\" the WHO wrote on Twitter.\n\nIt took the WHO a few days to finally concede on Twitter that person-to-person transmission was indeed possible, but it continued to downplay that threat for several days.\n\nOn February 4, the U.N. body cast doubt on assertions that asymptomatic persons infected by coronavirus could transmit the disease.\n\nAlthough coronavirus had been traced to an animal market in Wuhan by late January, the WHO claimed in early February that it did not know the source of the outbreak.\n\nAs of February 11, the WHO was still casting doubt on assertions that the virus originated from animals in China.\n\nOn February 14, the WHO tweeted that the body's director, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had pushed back against critics who denounced him for commending China's response to the virus.\n\nDr. Tedros told reporters that day:\n\nToo much has been written & said about my praise for [China]. I have given credit where it's due & I will continue to do that, as I would for any country that fights an outbreak aggressively at its source to protect its own people & the world, even at a great cost to itself.\n\nEchoing false Chinese communist party statements, the WHO tweeted on February 21 that Dr. Tedros had claimed that China's handling of the coronavirus gave the rest of the world \"a fighting chance of containing the spread of the coronavirus.\"\n\nAlthough coronavirus spread from China to the rest of the world, the WHO suggested earlier this year that Beijing contained the disease.\n\n\"This [coronavirus] is not influenza. With the right measures, it can be contained. That is one of the key messages from [China],\" the WHO Twitter account quoted its Dr. Tedros as telling reporters on February 27.\n\nThroughout the outbreak, there have been more cases in China than anywhere else in the world, making the communist country the epicenter of the global pandemic. Nevertheless, the WHO repeatedly claimed in February that new cases were on a downward spiral.\n\nOn March 13, the U.S. government summoned the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, to the State Department to protest Beijing's suggestion that the American military brought the coronavirus to China.\n\nTrump administration officials have lambasted China's propaganda effort to reframe the coronavirus outbreak as a triumph for communism now that new cases in the country have allegedly begun to drop.\n\nAccording to the WHO, calling the disease the \"Chinese coronavirus\" could lead to the stigmatization of Asian groups and \"potentially\" make them sicker.\n\nStigma occurs when people negatively associate an infectious disease with a specific population. This means that people are being labeled, stereotyped, separated and/or experience loss of status and discrimination because of a potential negative affiliation with [COVID-19].\n\n\"Stigmatization could potentially contribute to: more severe health problems; ongoing transmission; [and] difficulties controlling infectious diseases during an epidemic,\" the U.N. entity added.\n\nThe global health community stopped naming diseases after places in recent years.\n\nAt a January 28 meeting with Chinese dictator Xi Jinping, the WHO director reportedly offered effusive praise for Beijing's transparency and management of the coronavirus outbreak in late January, even though China initially tried to hide the epidemic from its public and the rest of the globe as the disease spread.\n\nDr. Tedros also blasted other governments, like the United States, that tried to prevent the outbreak from spreading even further beyond China's borders by suspending travel to and from the country.\n\nThis month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, proclaimed that the coronavirus outbreak would be \"worse\" if U.S. President Donald Trump had not implemented travel bans on China early this year.\n\nThe WHO director served as health minister in Ethiopia, which has a Marxist past. China is currently the largest foreign investor in the African country.\n\nCommunist China is now the second-biggest donor to the United Nation's regular budget after the United States. As such, Beijing holds considerable sway over the WHO, a U.N. entity.\n\nPerhaps one of the most glaring examples of the influence Beijing holds over the WHO is its success in blocking Taiwan's access to the body, a position that could devastate the Taiwanese people as coronavirus continues to spread.\n\nAlthough China does not control Taiwan, it claims the island as part of its territory.",

Meanwhile, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has stated that the evidence so far is anecdotal.\n\n\"Well add my name to those personal accounts because I am feeling better,\" Daniel Dae Kim said.

But this time we're talking about something so much more than hypocrisy.\n\nWe are currently in the middle of global pandemic, a state of siege that, in just two weeks, has shut down our economy and locked many of us up in our homes, either by government decree of just plain old fear, and...\n\nIn a time of national crisis, the left-wing fascists in the media want to use their corporate monopoly to put a stop to the president of the United States communicating directly with the American people who elected him.\n\nPlease go back and read that sentence again.

She then wants a handful of these multinational media corporations to -- again, this is not an exaggeration -- pick and choose the information from the president that Americans will be allowed to hear.\n\n\"Radical change is necessary. The cable networks and other news organizations that are taking the president's briefings as live feeds should stop doing so,\" she writes, before getting to the rub...\n\n\"Should they cover the news that's produced in them? Of course. Thoroughly and relentlessly -- with context and fact-checking built in to every step and every stage.\"\n\nIn other words, CORPORATIONS WILL DECIDE WHAT THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW, NOT THE PUBLIC'S ELECTED PRESIDENT!\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that this is exactly like something right out of a dystopian movie where large corporations have taken over ... everything.\n\nThe Washington Post is owned by no less than Jeff Bezos, the man who owns Amazon.com, which is one of the most powerful and disruptive multinational corporations the world has ever seen.\n\nWhat's more -- and this is important -- Amazon is a corporation that stands to exponentially expand its already vast wealth, power, and influence the more the American people are afraid to go outside, to go to the store.\n\nIf that's not frightening enough, the whole idea apparently began with Jay Rosen, a so-called NYU journalism professor.\n\nAnd it's not just corporate greed powering this frightening call to blacklist the American president.\n\nAs those polls were released, can you imagine the rage and impotent frustration throughout every corporate newsroom in New York and D.C. as reality once again proved the bubbled media have lost their ability to move the needle of public opinion?\n\nFor the past three weeks, the corporate media have been united in launching a legion of coronavirus lies at Trump, all in the hopes of turning the Chinese virus into \"Trump's Katrina,\" only to watch all that effort, hope, and malevolence meet a Trump approval rating of 55 percent.\n\nSo of course these utterly deranged, embittered, and fascist monsters want to stop the president from communicating with the public.\n\nNever forget that the media are a cult.

"Facebook 'Bug' Marked Genuine Coronavirus News as Spam", "body": "Tech giant Facebook recently admitted that it marked posts linking to genuine information and articles about the Wuhan coronavirus as spam, blaming a \"bug in an anti-spam system.\"\n\nThe Verge reported that on Tuesday evening, information began rolling in across social media that Facebook was labeling some posts and articles about the Wuhan coronavirus as spam, even when the articles were genuine and factual. The spam label drastically reduces the engagement on Facebook posts, in many cases making them essentially disappear.\n\nUsers across Twitter began posting about the phenomenon:\n\nAccording to Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of integrity, the issue was caused by a \"bug in an anti-spam system\" and Facebook began working to fix the issue on Tuesday. Rosen's tweet about the issue can be seen below in a reply to former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos:\n\nIn another tweet, Rosen explained: \"We've restored all the posts that were incorrectly removed, which included posts on all topics -- not just those related to COVID-19. This was an issue with an automated system that removes links to abusive websites, but incorrectly removed a lot of other posts too.\"\n\nIt was reported earlier this week that multiple Silicon Valley tech firms have stated that they're working together to fight misinformation surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic. Facebook published a joint statement from the tech firms on its website this week.

Dangerous Coronavirus Lies", "body": "America's deeply unserious but very corrupt and unreliable establishment media have no intention of changing their dangerous ways in the age of the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\nWatching the media spread lies and unnecessary panic over the last few weeks reminds me of the CNN Race Riots of 2014.\n\nAfter the George Zimmerman Hoax failed, after it was discovered that a white man had not hunted down and murdered a black teen (Zimmerman is Hispanic and a jury ruled he killed in self-defense), the fake news media moved on to the Hands-Up-Don't-Shoot Hoax, which was led primarily by far-left CNN and the far-left Washington Post.\n\nThe lies and hate spread by the corporate media resulted in multiple nights of rioting in the working class, predominantly black city of Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nThen, like a plague of locusts, and apparently under the impression the city doesn't already have enough problems, CNN moved on to Baltimore.\n\nThe reason the media's coronavirus lies remind me of the CNN Race Riots of 2014 is because This Matters.\n\nWhat I mean by that is that George Zimmerman, Ferguson, and Baltimore mattered. This was our malevolent media behaving exactly like a Bond villain: pushing a political agenda and looking to juice ratings at the expense of real people. Zimmerman, an innocent man, had his life and reputation ruined. The homes and businesses destroyed by those race riots are homes and businesses owned by everyday Americans, not the wealthy and certainly not CNN chief Jeff Zucker or anti-Trump activist Jake Tapper, whose fancy homes are miles away from the devastation they caused.\n\nYou see, as awful as the media have been over the last three years, the Russia Hoax and the Impeachment Hoax were D.C. food fights. That doesn't mean there wasn't collateral damage or that innocent people weren't hurt -- like President Trump and his family -- but politics is politics. You know the risks going in...\n\nCoronavirus is not a D.C. food fight. Like the CNN Race Riots of 2014, it affects everyday people: we have shut down our economy. The stock market is going insane. People are scared, worried, stressed, and have reason to be. Even if you remove the fear of the virus, no one can escape the fear of the panic, and the media's blatant lies are only adding to this uncertainty and fear -- and are doing so by design.\n\nAnd for what? To what end..? Well, for the exact same reasons the media ginned up those race riots: a depraved indifference to human life driven by nothing more than a political agenda and the naked greed that comes with ratings and clicks.\n\nKeep in mind, these are not mistakes. Mistakes are random. Mistakes fall both ways. Our fake news media's \"mistakes\" fall only one way -- in the direction of ginning up panic in our streets and hatred of Trump and his supporters, who have already paid a very heavy price.\n\nAs you read this list, no matter what you do, do not call the media the enemy of the people ... because that would be wrong.\n\nNow that the media can no longer attack Trump over the coronavirus testing (as you'll see below), we've moved to ventilators. \"Ventilators\" is the new Katrina, the new metric with which to beat Trump senseless with... So naturally, the media are going to lie shamelessly, which is exactly what they are doing, even as I write these words:\n\nAt least eight New York Times authors shared a deceptively edited quote Monday from President Donald Trump's recent call with state governors, creating the false impression that the president is denying federal support for ventilators that are needed in hospitals treating coronavirus patients.\n\nIn his message, the president recommended that states procure respirators and ventilators because it would be faster -- but added that the federal government \"will be backing you.\"\n\nThe Times journalists omitted the bulk of the president's statement as they shared the story on social media. The misleading, partial quote was also boosted by a CNN correspondent and became the lead headline at the left-wing Huffington Post.\n\nDespite growing online backlash to this misinformation, the journalists have yet to delete or retract their comments.\n\nHere's the president's full quote:\n\nRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment -- try getting it yourselves. We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.\n\nHe's telling the governors, Do what you can while we do what we can do. This is excellent advice the liars at the far-left New York Times are deliberately twisting to cause panic, to tell the public the president doesn't care.\n\nWhat better way to increase the world's hatred of America, everyone's hatred of Trump, and cause even more illegal aliens to crash into our country (seeking a vaccine) than to spread the fake news the American president is looking to monopolize any potential coronavirus vaccine?\n\nWhat good would it do America to corner the market on a vaccine? It costs us nothing to share the information so other countries can create their own vaccine. What good does it do the U.S. to sit around and watch everyone else die?\n\nGood ol' Jim Sciutto, one of the most infamous liars in the country, a former Obama official hired by the serial liars at CNN to serial lie.\n\n\"New: There are active discussions within the Trump administration to encourage a possible 'curfew' across the nation in which non-essential businesses would have to close by a certain time each night,\" Sciutto wrote on social media, citing \"CNN reporting.\"\n\nIt's not true.\n\nAnd unless you're looking to sow panic, it also makes no sense.\n\nWhat good would a curfew do, most especially a nationwide curfew?\n\n\"Google says it's not publishing a national-scale coronavirus site,\" CNN anti-Trump activist Jake Tapper tweeted to his 2.3 million Twitter followers last week.\n\nHe linked to a CNN story with the headline, \"Google says it's not publishing a national-scale coronavirus site anytime soon.\" This was a story that smeared Trump as a liar for announcing Google will be building a national-scale coronavirus website.\n\nGoogle will not be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon, contrary to claims made by President Donald Trump during a Friday news conference.\n\nInstead, a health-focused subsidiary owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, intends to launch a small-scale website next week to begin to triage California-based patients. The website will aim to serve a broader population only \"over time\" -- not \"very quickly,\" as Trump said.\n\n\"What we're building is a triage tool that will live on ProjectBaseline.com, and we plan to pilot it in California next week,\" said Carolyn Wang, a spokesperson for the Alphabet subsidiary, Verily.\n\nHere's the Google Search screencap which captured CNN's lie:\n\nGoogle will partner with US government to develop a nationwide coronavirus website, company says\n\nGoogle now says it is working with the government on the creation of a national website containing information about coronavirus symptoms and testing information.\n\n\"Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a national website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information,\" the company said in a series of tweets Saturday evening.\n\nThe company did not give a time frame of when such a website would be up and running.\n\nOn Friday after the President said Google was helping to develop a website and it would be available soon, the company declined to say it would be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon.\n\nNaturally, there is no editor's note informing readers the original story was a lie or has been retracted or updated, which is highly unethical.\n\nCNN spread a bald-faced lie to undermine the president, got caught, and did everything in its malevolent power to cover that lie up.\n\nDo I even need to point out how virulent and widespread this talking point has been?\n\nSigh:\n\nNo, the White House didn't 'dissolve' its pandemic response office. I was there.\n\nIt has been alleged by multiple officials of the Obama administration, including in The Post, that the president and his then-national security adviser, John Bolton, \"dissolved the office\" at the White House in charge of pandemic preparedness. Because I led the very directorate assigned that mission, the counterproliferation and biodefense office, for a year and then handed it off to another official who still holds the post, I know the charge is specious.\n\n...\n\nIt is true that the Trump administration has seen fit to shrink the NSC staff. But the bloat that occurred under the previous administration clearly needed a correction. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, congressional oversight committees and members of the Obama administration itself all agreed the NSC was too large and too operationally focused (a departure from its traditional role coordinating executive branch activity). As The Post reported in 2015, from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration's second term, the NSC's staff \"had quadrupled in size, to nearly 400 people.\" That is why Trump began streamlining the NSC staff in 2017.\n\nThe reduction of force in the NSC has continued since I departed the White House. But it has left the biodefense staff unaffected[.]\n\n...\n\nIt is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented. If anything, the combined directorate was stronger because related expertise could be commingled.\n\nIn other words, it wasn't dissolved, it was streamlined.\n\nAs has already been exhaustively pointed out, the naming of a virus or disease after a location -- including a lily-white location like Lyme, Connecticut -- is just how it's done and has been done forever.\n\nBut now it's racist, even though the very same media declaring it racist is the very same media that first called it the \"Chinese Virus\" or the \"Wuhan Virus,\" or some variation thereof.\n\nHere's a pretty comprehensive list that's been floating around. There are probably more examples, but this more than makes the point:\n\nAdditionally, the video below is nothing less than a devastating compilation of just how dishonest and unserious the media are:\n\nTo sum this up, the fake news media floods these words and terms into the American lexicon, and then sanctimoniously turns around and attacks those who repeat them as racist.\n\nIn the face of the facts, Trump is doing back-flips to start testing. What's more, how does not testing benefit his re-election chances? It's not as if people who test positive won't eventually become symptomatic.\n\nThis is not just a lie (no other media outlet has confirmed it, which means even CNN couldn't find a lying source that has lied to them so many times before to lie about this one), it's by far the stupidest lie on this list.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Tuesday that the blame for the slow pace of testing for coronavirus in the U.S. does not lie with either President Trump or the CDC.\n\nFauci told Hugh Hewitt on \"The Hugh Hewitt\" show that a \"technical glitch\" resulted in the delay in production of usable tests in the U.S., something Fauci prescribed to random error.\n\n...\n\n\"This has nothing to do with anybody's fault, certainly not the president's fault.\"\n\nWe are plagued with a dishonest, unreliable, unserious, dangerous media, driven only by

This falsehood almost deserves an entirely separate category of ignominy because of its ability to divide and frighten people in the middle of a crisis that requires social cooperation and trust.\n\nThe truth -- as explained earlier this week in the Washington Post by former National Security Council official Tim Morrison -- is that the office was combined with others in a reorganiztion that \"left the biodefense staff unaffected.\"\n\nBreitbart News had already fact-checked similar inaccurate claims by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg when he made them in the Democrat Debate in South Carolina on Feb. 26. We did it again last week.\n\nBiden has a particularly poor record on handling pandemics. In 2009, he caused panic during a swine flu outbreak by telling Americans not to take flights or ride subways. Today he barely remembers what disease we are fighting.\n\nNot once has Biden offered President Trump his support in the fight against the coronavirus.

The test will be available in the next few weeks and no training will be necessary to administer the tests.\n\nCepheid, a California-based diagnostic testing company, announced on Saturday that the FDA approved the use of its XpertXpress Sars-CoV-2 rapid molecular diagnostic test for the detection of the Chinese coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The test is designed to work on any of the company's more than 23,000 automated worldwide testing systems. The test provides results in about 45 minutes, company officials said in a written statement.\n\n\"During this time of increased demand for hospital services, Clinicians urgently need an on-demand diagnostic test for real-time management of patients being evaluated for admission to health-care facilities. An accurate test delivered close to the patient can be transformative -- and help alleviate the pressure that the emergence of the 2019-nCoV outbreak has put on healthcare facilities that need to properly allocate their respiratory isolation resources,\" Dr. David Persing, MD, Ph.D., Chief Medical and Technology Officer at Cepheid said in the statement. \"By leveraging the design principles of our current Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV cartridge technology, in which multiple regions of the viral genome are targeted to provide rapid detection of current and potential future variants of SARS-CoV-2, we have developed a test that provides reference lab-quality results in multiple settings where actionable treatment information is needed quickly.\"\n\nThe company states it currently has nearly 5,000 of its GeneXpert Systems located across the U.S. that are capable of point-of-care testing.\n\n\"The test we're authorizing today will be able to provide Americans with results within hours, rather than days like the existing tests, and the company plans to roll it out by March 30, which is an incredibly rapid timeline for such an effort. With new tools like point-of-care diagnostics, we are moving into a new phase of testing, where tests will be much more easily accessible to Americans who need them,\" HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a Saturday press release. \"With the development of point of care diagnostics, Americans who need tests will be able to get results faster than ever before. More and more options for reliable, convenient testing are becoming available at an incredibly rapid pace, thanks to the hard work of our FDA team and the ingenuity of American industry.\"\n\n\"Our automated systems do not require users to have specialty training to perform testing -- they are capable of running 24/7, with many systems already doing so today,\" Cepheid President Warren Kocmond added.\n\nThe company says it will begin shipping the tests next week.\n\n\"Our dedicated team at the FDA has been working nonstop to expedite the review and authorization of novel diagnostics during the COVID-19 public health emergency,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, M.D. concluded. \"Today marks an important step in expanding the availability of testing and, importantly, rapid results. Point-of-care testing means that results are delivered to patients in the patient care settings, like hospitals, urgent care centers and emergency rooms, instead of samples being sent to a laboratory. With today's authorization, there is now an option for testing at the point of care, which enables patient access to more immediate results.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_price@breitbart.com", "name": "Bob Price", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-of-care_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point-of-care testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Azar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Azar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hahn_(oncologist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Hahn (oncologist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Food_and_Drugs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Food and Drugs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/coronavirus-testing.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5619033", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 4525, "pinterest": 6}, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 4531, "relevance": 101}], "totalResults": 611, "page": 1, "count": 25, "pages": 25}}
