It's possible the U.S. may play there this summer and the NBA does not send teams this fall, Silver said.\n\n\"Those are issues that haven't been decided yet,\" Silver said Saturday night at his annual All-Star weekend news conference.\n\nThings are not back to normal for the league when it comes to relations with China. The strain started Oct. 4, when Houston general manager Daryl Morey tweeted an image that read \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\" referencing several months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.\n\nThe tweet wasn't up for long. The fallout was massive and continues. A pair of preseason games between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers in China were played days after Morey's tweet, though without the support of several sponsors and with both teams playing in silence -- none of the customary pre- and post-game media availabilities were held. The Chinese Basketball Association suspended its relationship with the Rockets, Chinese media giant Tencent and Chinese state television pulled some NBA broadcasts and Silver said the NBA quickly began experiencing significant financial losses.\n\nSilver said it's possible the NBA could lose as much as $400 million in revenue this year because of hits to the China market.\n\n\"Our games have not returned to CCTV, the government broadcaster,\" Silver said. \"My sense is they will at some point in the future. We are not pressing them. It's a decision that is outside of certainly our control and I'm often not even sure where that decision lies.\"\n\nThe NBA and Chinese officials have been talking, or at least were talking until much of the Chinese resources were redirected toward dealing with COVID-19, a disease stemming from a new form of coronavirus.\n\nBasketball, understandably, has been pushed aside while the Chinese deal with a massive crisis.\n\n\"This game of basketball is a huge game, and I've been blessed and fortunate enough to travel to China a number of times,\" All-Star Chris Paul of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who also is president of the National Basketball Players Association, said on Saturday. \"A friend of mine, Pooh Jeter, plays over in China, and I actually wrote 'Wuhan' on my shoes the other night in a game in New Orleans. (But) this isn't just a Wuhan problem. It's an everyone problem.\"\n\nWuhan is the city at the center of the outbreak. China's government suspended most access to Wuhan on Jan. 23. Restrictions have expanded to cities with a total of 60 million people in the broadest anti-disease measures ever imposed. Restaurants, shops and other businesses nationwide were ordered to close.\n\nThrough Friday, China reported a total of 66,492 cases of the virus, officially saying it was responsible for 1,523 deaths. Japan -- which will play host to this summer's Tokyo Olympics -- reported about 259 cases through Friday, with one death.\n\nInternational competitions in at least 14 different sports have been affected by the virus and the resultant concerns. Tokyo Olympic organizers and the International Olympic Committee have insisted that there are no plans to cancel or relocate the games.\n\n\"It's impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization.\n\nIt also makes it impossible to predict when matters between the NBA and China return to normal.\n\nThe NBA is immediately renaming the All-Star MVP trophy in honor of Kobe Bryant, the 18-time All-Star who -- along with his daughter Gianna and seven others -- died in a helicopter crash in Southern California last month.\n\nAll-Star weekend has taken on a somber tone this year, largely because of multiple tributes for Bryant and NBA Commissioner Emeritus David Stern, who died Jan. 1.\n\n\"I know it will be especially meaningful to that player that wins the first Kobe Bryant MVP,\" Silver said. \"So I'm sure there will be other honors as well, and as I mentioned, there are other things that we will be discussing with our board, the NBA board, when they meet in April to honor David. But this one seems so appropriate here at All-Star because nobody embodied All-Star more than Kobe Bryant.\"\n\nSCHEDULE CHANGES\n\nSilver said he remains optimistic that schedule changes he has wanted -- including an in-season tournament -- are viable possibilities.\n\nThe NBA was targeting adding such a tournament in 2021-22, the league's 75th anniversary year. But plans for an April vote on such a change were tabled weeks ago, and the timetable is uncertain.\n\n\"I may have been a little naive in thinking that for the 75th anniversary, we could say let's make all these changes,\" Silver said. \"We'll sort of see what happens in the 75th anniversary, and we'll go from there.\"\n\nAll-Stars polled by The Associated Press earlier Saturday about the potential of schedule changes were largely supportive of the notion, though the majority also said they do not know enough about the plans to have a strong opinion.\n\n\"I don't know. I mean our season is already long,\" said Portland guard Damian Lillard, who is missing the All-Star Game with an injury. \"I think if we're playing for something that would count, I can see it being OK, but there's a price for everything.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@breitbart.com", "name": "Associated

China's Virus Outbreak Response", "body": "The World Health Organization (WHO) warmly praised China on Saturday for its response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak, saying it has \"bought the world time\" and other nations should watch and learn before making the most of it. It is the second time in a matter of days the U.N. body has publicly backed the Communist regime.\n\nThe agency's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, delivered his unstinting praise of Beijing at a gathering of international foreign and security policy leaders in Germany.\n\nThe Ethiopian told other governments to step up their efforts to prepare for the virus, saying \"it's impossible to predict which direction this epidemic will take.\"\n\nTedros rejected outright claims China's bureaucratic paralysis and institutional negligence had in any way contributed to the global spread of the disease.\n\nInstead he wants China to serve as a model of efficiency and advanced medical care.\n\nHis assessment came as global concern remained high about the spread of the virus, which first emerged in China's central Hubei province in December, with the first death outside Asia reported in France this weekend.\n\nThe death toll jumped to 1,665 in mainland China on Sunday after 142 more people died from the virus. More than 68,000 people have now been infected -- but the number of new cases of the COVID-19 strain continued to decline.\n\nDespite those numbers, Tedros said WHO is encouraged there has not yet been widespread transmission outside China and \"the steps China has taken to contain the outbreak at its source appear to have bought the world time.\"\n\n\"We're encouraged that an international team of experts is now on the ground working closely with Chinese counterparts to understand the outbreak,\" Tedros told the Munich Security Conference.\n\nOn January 28 Tedros made a similar announcement praising China, expressing confidence in the measures it had taken to control the spread of the contagion, as Breitbart News reported.\n\nChina's government has since suspended most access to Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. Restrictions have expanded to cities with a total of 60 million people in the broadest anti-disease measures ever imposed. Restaurants, shops and other businesses nationwide were ordered to close.\n\nThe Lunar New Year holiday was extended to keep factories and offices closed, but now officials have been ordered to revive business activity as economic losses mount.\n\nOn Sunday, a host of new reprimands were made against officials in the virus-hit province, including the deputy governor of Qichun county who \"cut corners and worked around the centralised quarantine order,\" according to Hubei authorities.\n\nFive other party officials from across Hubei were given warnings for offences such as not preventing mass gatherings in their areas.\n\nChina's central bank said it will also disinfect banknotes with ultraviolet light or high temperatures and store them for up to 14 days before they are put back into circulation.\n\nLast week the WHO appealed for $675 million in special, one-off funding to deliver two months worth of direct aid to China and international agencies working to counter the epidemic.",

Medicine, Can Shut Down Our Pharmacies, Hospitals in Months", "body": "China could effectively shut down America's healthcare system within months given the one-party state's \"global chokehold\" on the manufacturing of medicines and medical supplies, explained Rosemary Gibson, author of China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America's Dependence on China for Medicine.\n\nGibson, senior adviser at the Hastings Center, offered her remarks on Thursday's edition of SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Ed Martin.\n\nMansour noted how the coronavirus outbreak in China has exposed America's dangerous dependence on Chinese production of pharmaceutical and medical supplies, including an estimated 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed for domestic drug production.\n\nGibson said, \"If China shuts the door on exports of medicines and the ingredients to make them, within a couple of months our pharmacies would be empty. Our healthcare system would cease to function. That's how dependent we are.\"\n\nGibson added, \"Say there's a coronavirus outbreak in the United States, God forbid, and a lot of people end up in hospitals with severe cases. The medicines needed to care for them if they can't breathe and are on a ventilator -- fentanyl and propofol -- [are made in China]. We depend on China for the raw materials. If they go into shock, the epinephrine and dopamine we need to care for them, we depend on China. If they have bacterial infections, we depend on China for the antibiotics.\"\n\nMany over-the-counter supplements sold in the U.S. are at least partly manufactured in China, Gisbon noted. \"We can't make [vitamin C] here anymore. That comes from China.\"\n\nAmerica has lost much of its manufacturing apparatus for medicines to China via globalization, explained Gibson. \"With our medicines, it's not just the active ingredient [that is made in China]. It's the raw chemicals, the molecules, the white powdery stuff, that we also depend on China for. That's where China has the real global chokehold.\"\n\nGibson explained how generic drugs manufacturers around the world are dependent on China for raw materials.\n\n\"Another shocking thing I discovered is that India and its huge generic [drug] industry -- they're the top generic producer in the world, although I think China's going to overtake them in about five to ten years -- even India depends on China,\" Gibson stated.\" [India's] generic industry would shut down within weeks and months without those core components, and you see it in the Indian press, right now, that they're already concerned about this because this coronavirus in China is really disrupting supply chains.\"\n\nChina uses predatory mercantilist policies -- including dumping -- to undercut American and Western drug manufacturers, just as the communist state did with steel and other commodities, noted Mansour.\n\nGibson recalled, \"I documented China's penicillin cartel. There's an incredible story of how we lost our penicillin manufacturing plants. These are huge industrial facilities, big fermentation plants, and China came in and knocked them out in the U.S. and even India by dumping it on the global market at really cheap prices -- keeping it low for several years -- and then the price goes back up again.\"\n\nGibson went on, \"So we can't make penicillin, and this was the playbook for how we lost aspirin manufacturing, vitamin C, and so many other antibiotics that we rely on. We're talking about last-resort antibiotics, medicines to treat sepsis, MRSA, [and] C. diff. These are the antibiotics you give to your kids for ear infections, or you take if you have a tooth infection of staph infection.\"\n\nGibson warned, \"We are so vulnerable. These are infectious diseases, and we depend on China to treat them.\"\n\nAmerican politicians have been absent on the issue of domestic hemorrhaging of drug manufacturing capabilities to China, Gibson said.\n\n\"Nobody did anything about it,\" lamented Gibson. \"This has been going on for almost 20 years. In fact, no one wanted to even expose it. That's why it took so long to figure this out and to put it out there, to reveal our dependence. It's really quite remarkable. The American public's been thrown under the bus.\"\n\nMansour asked why American politicians allowed domestic manufacturing of medicines and medical supplies to be outsourced to China.\n\nGibson replied, \"There was country-of-origin legislation introduced in Congress around 2008 that would require companies to state on their packages where their product is made, and it was killed immediately. So I asked someone in the industry, someone who worked there for more than 30 years, 'So, what's going on here?' and this person said, 'Well, the industry thought it probably wouldn't be good for business if their customers knew where their medicines were coming from.'\"\n\nGibson continued, \"Our military is dependent on China. So the young men and women in the South China Sea on those aircraft carriers, they're dependent on their adversary for their medicine.\n\nGibson reflected on the testimony of Larry Wortzel, a 32-year veteran and retired Army colonel, regarding contaminated blood pressure medicines made in China. Wortzel's comments were made during a 2019 hearing of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\n\"It was spellbinding,\" recalled Gibson, \"for 90 seconds, he described how he got three different blood pressure medicines. They were made in India but the ingredients came from China, and it had rocket fuel compounds in it. ... He said, 'If I'm getting it, that means our active duty military are all getting it.' This is how far down we have come in our standards with our medicine.\"\n\n\"There are no short-term solutions,\" Gibson stated of measures to restore America's medical manufacturing capacity. \"We have lost so much of our industrial base to make our own medicines, and you don't create that overnight. ... the FDA has proposed some measures, going forward, that drug manufacturers produce risk management plans and require them to identify alternate sources in case there are future disruptions.\"\n\nGibson continued, \"You know what the problem with that is? So many of these manufacturers [are now] Chinese domestic companies that are now ramping up from ingredients to making generic finished drugs. So now, 90 percent of the generic drugs sold in the United States [are linked to China]. They're birth control pills, antidepressants, HIV/AIDS medicines, medicines for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, diabetes.\"\n\n\"China's on track to gain control of our generic drugs, and so the FDA has proposed that it's going to ask manufacturers to tell us what their plan B is,\" added Gibson. \"So we're going to be effectively relying on Chinese companies to help us out in a future emergency.\"\n\nGibson noted, \"China's stated aim is to become the pharmacy to the world with its own companies. And what we're seeing with Western generic drug companies, they're collapsing because they can't compete.\"\n\nGibson said, \"There's a chapter in China Rx called \"Made in China, Sue in America? Good Luck.\" One of these reasons for the cheap price is that Chinese companies assume no liability for the quality of their product. When there was this huge recall of blood pressure medicines in the U.S. and around the world, it was because of a single company in China that made the active ingredient that had carcinogens in it -- these rocket fuel compounds -- and they knowingly sent product to the United States, knowingly knew that it didn't meet U.S. standards, and it went on for four years before we picked it up.\"\n\nGibson continued, \"What we're seeing is not just our supply coming from China, but the quality that is diminishing, and the FDA's leverage to protect the public is just falling apart. Look, the FDA had to recall inspectors from China because of the coronavirus. It's going to be months before [FDA] employees go back there, and they volunteer for those positions. The agency can't [compel them]. Who's going to want to go?\"\n\nGibson added, \"Just imagine you're an FDA inspector over there and you're in this big Chinese plant and you write a report, and you see some very serious violations, do you think the Chinese government will ever want you back in the country? Would you ever want to go back? Would you be afraid of retaliation?\"\n\n\"I think we have to prepare for a future where the FDA will have virtually no leverage in China to really protect the American people,\" assessed Gibson. \"[The FDA] is already making trade-offs between substandard medicines and preventing shortages in medicines. It's allowing stuff in that doesn't meet standards, because we have no choice.\"\n\nFree market solutions can't correct China's mercantilist undercutting of Western drug and medical supply manufacturing.\n\n\"Some are saying, 'Let the free market fix it,'\" noted Gibson. \"There is no free market. We wouldn't allow this for our nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers to operate, because we'd be making them in China. We need to think of our medicines as a strategic asset. Not as something cheap that we outsource to a country that has a lot of problems.\"\n\nGibson added, \"It's not a free market. They cheated [with] subsidies to these Chinese companies, so it's very hard for any U.S. or Western company to compete, because you're competing not with Chinese companies, you're competing with the Chinese government.\"\n\n\"We're losing our manufacturing base,\" warned Gisbon. \"It's just collapsing before our eyes. It's the reason why we have really poor quality medicines now coming in.\"\n\nGibson quoted a physician she spoke with, \"We're becoming like a developing country with our medicines.\"\n\nGibson proposed federal industrial policy to renew domestic manufacturing of medicines and medical products.\n\n\"I would have our federal government invest in helping to rebuild our industrial base using advanced manufacturing technology that can produce our medicines much more cheaply, safely, with less environmental footprint, and fully, from soup to nuts from those core raw materials to finished drug in one location all here in the United States,\" Gibson advised.\n\nGibson added, \"There will be opponents who say, 'No, we should let the market do it.' The market will never do this. They'll never make this investment. So we have to decide as a country, do we want to have some degree of self-sufficiency in our ability to make medicine? Do we want our military not to be dependent on China for pharmaceuticals to treat chemical and biological agents?\"\n\n\"We'll be depending on China to help us out when we run out of medicines,\" warned Gibson. \"The absurdity of it is extraordinary. We have to decide as a country, do we want to have some capacity to make our own medicines, or not?\"\n\n\"Would you trust taking a last resort antibiotic for your child that was made in China?\" asked Gisbon. \"Would you trust it? Would you trust a chemotherapy if your child has leukemia? More than ten percent of the generics that have been tested in the U.S. don't meet standards, by the way.\"\n\nGibson went on \"Most Americans don't trust. They remember when thousands of dogs and cats died when a Chinese company contaminated pet food, and hundreds of humans died when the Chinese did a very insidious and sophisticated operation to contaminate a blood thinner widely used in hospitals.\"\n\n\"A number of hospitals are having to test certain medicines because physicians see that there's just something not working,\" stated Gibson. \"So we have this 18 percent of our GDP in our healthcare system, and we're relying on these components from China that are essential for helping people recover, that make a difference between life or death. It's insanity.\"\n\n\"Food was used as a weapon of war\" in World Wars I and II, said Gibson, warning of the political weaponization of medicines.\n\n\"Our medicines can be weaponized,\" Gibson observed. \"China can withhold them. China has threatened the United States with drug shortages in the past, it had nothing to do with the trade issue.Think of the leverage you give to a country when it controls your antibiotics.\"\n\nEighty-five percent of the America's strategic national stockpile of medicines and medical supplies depends on China, Gibson noted.\n\nGibson concluded, \"We have to diversify away from China and bring some manufacturing of essential medicines back home to this country.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Coronavirus with Children's Rap Song", "body": "Singapore's latest gambit to defeat the Wuhan coronavirus is \"Bye Bye Virus,\" a so-bad-it's-irresistible rap song and dance video intended to remind people to wash their hands.\n\nThe gobsmacked writers at Coconuts Singapore saluted the Ministry of Education video for at least distracting them from thinking about the epidemic for a while:\n\nThe music video's cringe begins with afterthought rhymes and lackluster beats before going on to introduce five virus superheroes dubbed The Soaper 5: Super Soaper Soffy, Hands Down Hanna, Mask Up Mei Mei, Virus Screener Varun and Wipe Up Wilson.\n\n\"Wash your hands to the beat/Let's keep the virus off the streets/Don't touch your face with your bare hands/Cos you don't know where the germs will land,\" is just the start of the one-minute jam.\n\nIt's easy to mock, but if we're sharing it, so mission accomplished?\n\nAnother line from the song says, \"Wear a mask if you're falling sick / Go see a doctor, don't be so thick.\" In all honesty, it is the kind of line small children might enjoy shouting in each other's faces.\n\nCrowded Singapore has been one of the most palpably nervous governments in Asia since the beginning of the outbreak. It has done a fairly good job of holding the Wuhan virus at bay so far, with nine new cases reported on Friday for a total of 67. 17 of the patients have been discharged, while six remain in critical condition. There have not yet been any coronavirus-related fatalities in Singapore.\n\nMost of those cases are linked to five \"clusters\" of people who traveled across China or had contact with Chinese visitors, including two churches and a business meeting held at the Grand Hyatt hotel.\n\nSingaporean officials have placed a high priority on finding \"Patient Zero\" from the Grand Hyatt, the individual who infected over a dozen people from five different countries who attended a sales meeting at the luxury establishment. The World Health Organization (WHO) is also investigating the Grand Hyatt meeting as a possible \"super spreader\" event.\n\nHealth authorities expressed some frustration at Singaporeans insisting on going out to work and enjoy recreational activities despite the government encouraging them to stay at home until the epidemic is under control. The government has asked doctors to provide all patients complaining of respiratory problems with five-day medical certificates to keep them home from work.\n\n\"With mild symptoms, we sometimes let our guard down. We continue going out even though we don't really feel well and that's how the virus transmits,\" National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said on Friday.\n\nHealth Minister Gan Kim-yong said on Friday that despite rumors to the contrary, there are no current plans to raise Singapore's pandemic alert level from orange to red, its highest level. When the alert was raised from yellow to orange last week, it triggered a panic rush on supplies at local supermarkets.\n\nOn the other hand, senior official Janil Puthucheary of the Ministry of Transport said on Thursday the worst of the epidemic might still lie ahead for Singapore.\n\n\"I think it's really too early to talk about a peak. Cases are coming in on a daily basis and you have to have the expectation there are going to be more cases over the next few weeks,\" he told CNBC.\n\n\"The issue is really whether these are going to be cases that are linked to the existing spread, existing cluster, links to China or whether we have an increasing number of cases that are unlinked community spread,\" he added.", "source": {"uri":

"body": "The first mass quarantine outside of China for the Wuhan coronavirus was reported in Vietnam on Thursday, with over 10,000 people living in farming communities near Hanoi locked down for 20 days after six virus infections were discovered.\n\nAFP reported on Thursday that six villages in the Son Loi farming region, covering 2,500 acres about 25 miles from Hanoi, have been quarantined and surrounded by security checkpoints:\n\nHealth officials wearing protective suits sprayed disinfectant on vehicles. Police warned people wanting to enter the quarantined area that while they would be allowed in, they would not be able to leave.\n\nThe order comes after the health ministry reported that five people have been infected with the virus. It later announced a sixth case.\n\nThey all originated from a female worker who was sent to Wuhan in central China -- where the virus originated -- for training.\n\nThe disease then spread to her family and her neighbors, including a three-month-old baby.So far, only the female worker has fully recovered and been discharged from the hospital, according to updates from the ministry, while the others remain in a \"stable\" condition.\n\nThe disease was reportedly spread by celebrations of the Lunar New Year, a holiday known as Tet in Vietnam. Villagers said they have been told to avoid large gatherings for the duration of the crisis. Residents of the area said they are having trouble getting work in the vital construction industry because clients are suddenly reluctant to hire anyone from Son Loi.\n\nVietnam has reported a total of 16 coronavirus infections to date. Although the Vietnamese government banned air travel to China, the land border has proven difficult to lock down.\n\nVietnam rejected docking requests from two cruise ships this week due to coronavirus concerns. A local official explained that forbidding cruise passengers to disembark was \"just a temporary solution to prevent the intrusion of diseases.\"\n\nThe captain of one ship, the Norwegian Jade, shot back that Vietnamese port officials have been \"unreasonable during this process\" and refused to allow his ship to dock despite having no signs of illness aboard and no passengers who had visited China recently.\n\nThe Norwegian Jade ultimately headed for Thailand, which is believed to have given it permission to dock at the port of Laem Chabang.\n\nReuters noted that Vietnam is planning to quarantine hundreds of its own citizens at military camps and temporary facilities along the border as they return from China.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

China has not failed the WHO's trust and it has achieved the strictest control over the virus,\" the Global Times trumpeted.\n\nAt least 14 countries resolutely ignored WHO's advice and quickly imposed travel bans on China. Many airlines independently canceled service to all or part of China, independent of the steps taken by national governments. Many of these bans were implemented without warning, leaving travelers stranded and separated from each other.\n\n\"Some countries have completely cut off traffic communications with China and even banned non-citizens who have been to China within the last 14 days to enter their country. This is a serious violation of WHO recommendations. As the situation has significantly relaxed in recent days, these countries should reconsider and revoke these practices,\" the Global Times urged, citing the enormous cost of the travel bans.\n\n\"As China has made a lot of efforts and explorations to control COVID-19, it is completely irrational to implement inter-country isolation to prevent the spread of the disease. It is unscientific and also violates the interests of all countries,\" the editorial observed, using the formal name assigned to the disease, which China very much wants the rest of the world to stop referring to as the \"Wuhan virus.\"\n\nThe travel bans so disliked by China were meant to be temporary, and many of them had specific expiration dates. On Thursday, Australia announced that its ban on Chinese travelers, originally set to expire on Saturday, would be extended for at least one more week and would be reconsidered again at that time.\n\nThis decision, which will clearly have expensive ramifications for Australia's $8 billion tourism industry with China, was made in part because of a sudden spike in new coronavirus cases. The number of cases China reported from the center of the epidemic in Hubei province shot up by over 14,800 on Wednesday, plus another 242 reported deaths.\n\nThe surge in new cases occurred only a few days after Chinese officials claimed the number of new cases was declining and the epidemic might be peaking. WHO sought to cushion the bad news by saying the spike in coronavirus cases was largely due to China using better and faster testing methods, along with a clump of results from the older and slower methods coming in at the same time. The new infection standards have only been implemented in Hubei province thus far, so the total number of infections would presumably spike again if other parts of China began using the same procedures as Hubei.\n\nInternational health officials, notably including those in Singapore, on Wednesday questioned China's confident predictions of the virus \"peaking\" and warned that in any case, peak infection rates in other countries will probably lag a few months behind China because it took longer for the epidemic to spread there.\n\nU.S. officials on Wednesday defended the strict travel ban on Chinese nationals and foreigners who recently visited China. Anthony Fauci of the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) National institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the decision to implement travel bans \"was not made lightly.\" Other CDC officials said the travel restrictions gave the U.S. valuable time to prepare and avoid a \"worse pandemic.\"\n\nEpidemiologists are worried about the coronavirus spreading outside China, but so far only a relative handful of infections have been reported within China's borders.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name": "John Hayward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Times", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Global Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air travel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alien (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 75}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Conferences", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 20}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/coronavirus-3.png", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {}, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1447751304", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-14", "time": "13:19:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-14T13:19:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-14T13:19:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/13/china-guangzhou-metropolis-bans-restaurant-dining-over-coronavirus/", "title": "China: Guangzhou Metropolis Bans Restaurant Dining over Coronavirus", "body": "China's southern port city of Guangzhou banned dining in restaurants, local media reported Wednesday, as a measure to prevent the novel coronavirus epidemic in the country from becoming worse.\n\nAt press time, China has documented nearly 60,000 cases of coronavirus nationwide, at least one in every province. The majority of the over 1,000 deaths caused occurred within China, but patients have died in Hong Kong, Japan, and the Philippines.\n\nThe ban went into affect at 9 p.m. Wednesday local time, the South China Morning Post reported:\n\nThe ban on dining in applies to restaurants, but employees can continue to have meals at their company canteens. And while residents can still get takeaways from restaurants, they have been encouraged to do this online, and have their meals delivered, rather than collecting their orders.\n\nGroup gatherings have also been banned in the city, and according to Nanfang Daily, some 126 banquets that would have involved more than 90,000 people have been cancelled by authorities already. The authorities did not say how long the measures would be in place.\n\nGuangzhou is not the only city in Guangdong province to bring in a ban on dining in restaurants - Futian district in Shenzhen, Xiangzhou in Zhuhai, Foshan and Zhongshan have all taken the same step.\n\nThe Post story included interviews with a range of people who commented on the ban and how it is affecting them and how it will be harmful to local businesses.\n\n\"My wife and I ... are used to having dim sum, tea and Cantonese dishes at the local restaurants every week.

on U.S. Drug, Medical Supplies", "body": "The coronavirus outbreak has exposed the United States' dangerous dependence on China for pharmaceutical and medical supplies, including an estimated 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to produce drugs in the United States.\n\nThe economic repercussions of the coronavirus reveal the dangers of allowing one country to have a near monopoly on global manufacturing, David Dayen explains in an article at the American Prospect:\n\nChina is a source of not only finished goods, but also of input parts and raw materials. A substantial number of the materials needed for defense and electronic systems come from China, and that nation is \"the single or sole supplier for a number of specialty chemicals,\" according to a recent Defense Department report. Rare earth minerals, which are critical to electronics, are largely mined in China. As a result, Chinese disruptions don't just hit Chinese manufacturing, they hit everyone's. Automakers have already had to slow or shut down factories globally due to supply shortages.\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern is over medical supplies. China produces and exports a large amount of pharmaceuticals to the U.S., including 97 percent of all antibiotics and 80 percent of the active ingredients used to make drugs here. Penicillin, ibuprofen, and aspirin largely come from China. Last month, the medical supply firm Cardinal Health recalled 2.9 million surgical gowns \"cross contaminated\" at a plant in China; the blood pressure drug valsartan also saw shortages recently, thanks to tainted active ingredients at one Chinese plant. The combination of supply chain disruptions and increased demand at hospitals if coronavirus spreads to the U.S. could prove devastating.\n\nIn a dark irony, most of the world's face masks -- now ubiquitous in China as a precaution -- are made in China and Taiwan, and even for those made elsewhere, some component parts are Chinese-sourced. Shortages have led China to declare the masks a \"strategic resource,\" reserving them for medical workers. U.S. hospitals are \"critically low\" on respiratory masks, according to medical-supply middlemen. Lack of protective gear could increase vulnerability to the virus, and the one place on earth suffering from production shutdowns is the one place where most of the protective gear originates [emphasis added].\n\nIn testimony yesterday before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Scott Gottlieb, a physician and the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner in the Trump administration, explained in detail the extent of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry's dependence on China:\n\nAbout 40 percent of generic drugs sold in the U.S. have only a single manufacturer. A significant supply chain disruption could cause shortages for some of many of these products.\n\nLast year, manufacturing of intermediate or finished goods in China, as well as pharmaceutical source material, accounted for 95 percent of U.S. imports of ibuprofen, 91 percent of U.S. imports of hydrocortisone, 70 percent of U.S. imports of acetaminophen, 40 to 45 percent of U.S. imports of penicillin, and 40 percent of U.S. imports of heparin, according to the Commerce Department. In total, 80 percent of the U.S. supply of antibiotics are made in China.\n\nWhile much of the fill finishing work (the actual formulation of finished drug capsules and tablets) is done outside China (and often in India) the starting and intermediate chemicals are often sourced in China. Moreover, the U.S. generic drug industry can no longer produce certain critical medicines such as penicillin and doxycycline without these chemical components.\n\nAccording to a report from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, China's chemical industry, which accounts for 40 percent of global chemical industry revenue, provides a large number of ingredients for drug products. It's these source materials -- where in many cases China is the exclusive source of the chemical ingredients used for the manufacture of a drug product -- that create choke points in the global supply chain for critical medicines.\n\nMoreover, when it comes to starting material for the manufacture of pharmaceutical ingredients, a lot of this production is centered in China's Hubei Provence, the epicenter of coronavirus. Most drug makers have a one to three-months of inventory of drug ingredients on hand. But these supplies are already being drawn down. Among big [active pharmaceutical makers] makers in Wuhan are Wuhan Shiji Pharmaceutical, Chemwerth, Hubei Biocause, Wuhan Calmland Pharmaceuticals. [emphasis added]\n\nGottlieb notes that \"80 percent of the U.S. supply of antibiotics are made in China.\" The sourcing of this estimate is explained in greater detail in section three of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission's 2019 report to Congress, titled \" Growing U.S. Reliance on China's Biotech and Pharmaceutical Products.\"\n\nThe report notes that China is \"the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The United States is heavily dependent on drugs that are either sourced from China or include APIs sourced from China.\" The report further explains that although India is the world's leading supplier of generic drugs, India gets 80 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients directly from China. The United States also imports 80 percent of its APIs from overseas (primarily from India and China) and \"a substantial portion\" of its generic drugs \"either directly from China or from third countries like India that use APIs sourced from China.\"\n\nIn other words, almost all pharmaceutical roads lead to China.\n\nFurthermore, the report notes that China's dominance of the chemical industry and global manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients means that \"the world is becoming increasingly dependent on China as the single source for life-saving drugs.\"\n\n\"The U.S. generic drug industry can no longer produce certain critical medicines such as penicillin and doxycycline, and the APIs needed to make these antibiotics are sourced from China,\" the report states.\n\nChina achieved this dominance in the pharmaceutical industry by the same methods it employed to dominate the steel industry - through anti-competitive trade practices that dumped cheap state-subsidized products on foreign markets to drive competitors out of business.\n\nThe report states:\n\nRosemary Gibson, senior advisor at the Hastings Center and author of China RX, noted in her testimony before the Commission that the United States is losing its ability to produce generic drugs because Chinese drug companies dumped low-price products into the global market, which in turn pushed U.S., European, and Indian producers out of the generic drug manufacturing business. According to Ms. Gibson, China is seeking to disrupt, dominate, and displace U.S. pharmaceutical and other medical companies, and in doing so limit the United States' ability to produce its own medicines, including critical antibiotics such as penicillin and even generic aspirin. She believes the United States could see its generic drug industry made uncompetitive within five to ten years due to the Chinese government's policies (including subsidies and export incentives) that allow Chinese pharmaceutical firms to undercut prices and drive U.S. firms out of business. [emphasis added]\n\nIronically, China's success in monopolizing the U.S. drug market with these anti-competitive trade practices was reportedly cited by President Trump's former economic adviser Gary Cohn as an argument against Trump's efforts to fight back against China's trade violations.\n\nIn his book Fear: Trump in the White House, Bob Woodward describes a heated discussion among Trump administration officials about the repercussions of a trade war with China. Cohn, who disagreed with the president's decision to impose tariff's on Beijing, reportedly invoked a Commerce Department study showing that 97 percent of all U.S. antibiotics come from China. \"'If you're the Chinese and you want to really just destroy us, just stop sending us antibiotics,' he said.\"\n\nGlobalist critics like Cohn of Trump's trade policies \"fretted that turbulence from the Trump administration's tariffs would have catastrophic results on the global economy,\" Curtis Ellis wrote last week in an op-ed for Breitbart News. These critics proved to be wrong.\n\nHowever, the virus itself will cause economic disruptions because it \"has exposed the frailty of global supply chains and the fallacy of the management theory calling for intercontinental supply chains and just-in-time inventory management,\" Ellis writes.\n\nOr, to put it another way, the tariffs did not hurt the U.S. economy, but the current virus outbreak in China could because of the very problem that the tariffs were enacted, in part, to address. In this sense, the virus has vindicated the Trump's administration's tough trade stance and affirmed the necessity of moving the world's supply chains out of China. If anything, Trump's tariffs may have actually made the U.S. economy somewhat more resilient because they encouraged companies to begin the process of moving production out of China.\n\nBut this vindication could be of little consolation to Trump if the virus's ripple effects hurt the economy during an election year. The political repercussions could be significant for a president who has touted the strong economy has become a major re-election selling point.\n\nEconomists are already expecting the virus to have a major impact on China's economy. Breitbart News's John Carney reports, HSBC \"lowered its estimate for the first quarter growth from an annualized rate of 5.8 percent to 4.1 percent\" for China. \"The bank's estimate for full year growth was lowered by half a percentage point from 5.8 percent to 5.3 percent.\"\n\nAs for the global economic impact, Dayen quotes Washington University in St. Louis professor Panos Kouvelis who estimates $300 to $400 billion in supply chain damage over a period of up to two years.\n\n\"That's actually manageable as a share of the global economy,\" Dayen writes. \"But as new cases pop up in Singapore, an important financial hub, and as the head of the World Health Organization warns that we could be seeing only the 'tip of the iceberg,' those numbers could already be out of date.\"\n\nThose numbers may indeed be overly optimistic. In his testimony before the Senate yesterday, Gottlieb warned of the potential for the coronavirus epidemic to become a full pandemic-and maybe even endemic-now that it has spread to Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. \"It could take a new position as a more sinister member of the seasonal pathogens that circulate each year and infect humans,\" he said, noting that \"the next month is critical.\"\n\n\"We must prepare for the prospect that the virus evaded our border protections and was already introduced into the U.S. in late December or early January -- when it first appears to have become epidemic in China's Hubei province. Those index cases could have seeded community spread, and eventually, outbreaks could emerge in America,\" Gottlieb stated.\n\nWhatever the economic impacts of the coronavirus, the current dependence on an authoritarian communist regime for vital necessities is an indictment of the globalists economic policies that have endangered U.S. national security and long-term prosperity.\n\n\"[T]he economic threats to locating so much of the global supply chain in one part of the world were eminently predictable,\" writes Dayen. \"Neoliberal dogma about 'comparative advantage' and a concomitant preference for mass outsourcing put the world on a tenuous path.\"\n\nThere is a growing consensus among populists on the right and left about the need to address the neoliberal trade and economic policies that gave China a monopoly on the world's supply chains.\n\nGottlieb urged Congress to empower the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \"to look not only at the supply of finished products but to also identify circumstances where key components may have only a single source across an entire category of products.\"\n\nMatt Stoller, author of Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy, writes that Gottlieb is essentially asking for the FDA \"to have the authority to uncover hidden monopolies.\"\n\n\"The Federal Trade Commission already has this research authority, it just doesn't use it very often,\" Stoller explains. \"And the United States Trade Representative has information on our dependencies on China, because when they threatened tariffs large numbers of companies came to them during a notice and comment period whining about how such dependencies would hurt their business. So we have some information about the scale of the problem. Just not enough.\"\n\n\"The strongest reason to address monopolies isn't because monopolies are unjust, but because they are dangerous,\" Stoller notes. \"And we may be about to find out just how dangerous they are.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_mansour@breitbart.com", "name": "Rebecca Mansour", "type": "author",

with firecrackers and gasoline because his birthday party was canceled by officials worried about the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nReuters on Wednesday summarized reports of the odd case from Chinese state media:\n\nThe resident of the southwestern city of Chongqing planned a birthday banquet for more than ten tables of guests on Jan. 28, the state-run agency said on Wednesday, but local officials battling the outbreak asked him to cancel the plan.\n\nBut on Jan. 26, after the man failed to convince them to let the party go ahead, he wrapped firecrackers round his waist, poured gasoline on his chest and held up a lighter, trying to threaten them into agreeing.\n\n\"The actions prevented town and village cadres from carrying out epidemic prevention and control work,\" Xinhua said, adding that 10 patients visiting a clinic on a lower level of the same building had also been affected.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what kind of penalties the man would face if convicted.\n\nAccording to

Four of them were given ten-day administrative detention sentences and all were slapped with fines that worked out to a little over $70 in U.S. currency.\n\nThe vague charges filed against the five medical workers suggested they were somehow jeopardizing China's battle against the coronavirus by sharing the information, without detailing exactly what \"bad effects\" they had inflicted.\n\nThe Epoch Times reported a sharp social media backlash to the detentions, with many Chinese citizens angry that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) seemed to have learned nothing from the persecution of Li Wenliang, who was initially harassed and humiliated by the authorities for \"spreading rumors\" but retroactively rebranded as a hero shortly before the virus killed him:\n\n\"The CCP system has completely lost its ability to correct itself. It would be foolish to expect them to have a conscience,\" one netizen wrote.\n\nAnother said: \"Li Wenliang just died, and they [authorities] are persecuting medical workers who tell the truth again!\"\n\n[...]\n\nNetizens saw the latest punishment on the Yunnan medical staff as a sign that the authorities are still more concerned about its image. \"So you still expect the government to improve in this outbreak? Stop dreaming.\"\n\n\"[The CCP] is running towards its own demise,\" another said.\n\nThe backlash appears to have had an immediate effect on the CCP, which used its media organs to chastise police in the city of Wenshan for harassing the medical workers, as reported by the South China Morning Post:\n\nIn an unusual reaction to the charges brought in Wenshan, Health Times, a newspaper under the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily, published a commentary on Friday questioning the police's actions.\n\nAuthorities in the city should make public exactly what information the five medical workers leaked, it said.\n\nEven though the information they shared might have been about patients or frontline efforts to battle the outbreak, their actions were neither malicious nor did they cause any \"bad effects\", it said.\n\nRather, it said, they might have been doing the public a service.\n\nThe Wenshan police bureau quickly issued a notice that the detentions meted out to four of the five defendants were suspended, without explaining why.\n\nHowever, the SCMP noticed that China's Cyberspace Administration also blacklisted an app called Pip Gaoxiao that was being used by Chinese citizens to share videos, including those related to the coronavirus. Major social media platforms were ordered to clamp down on coronavirus posts and shut down numerous accounts for \"illegally reporting activities.\" The CCP might have decided to handle the five Yunnan medical workers with kid gloves, but it's not showing any sign of relaxing media controls.\n\nYunnan province was the source of another noteworthy coronavirus story this week: a plan to track contact between residents by requiring them to use their cell phones to scan a code every time they enter or leave a public place.\n\nCritics quoted by the South China Morning Post trounced the plan as intrusive, demanding, confusing, and more useful for intimidating people than fighting the virus epidemic:\n\nThe mini-program, whose name roughly translates as \"Fight the coronavirus in Yunnan\", requires users to enter their phone number and receive a verification code to register. After that, they scan the \"in\" and \"out\" code when visiting public places such as airports, railway stations, subways, bus terminals, shopping malls, supermarkets, residential areas, as well as hospitals and pharmacies.\n\nThe mini-program does not ask users to enter their name and national identity numbers.\n\n[...]\n\nThe move has sparked criticism on social media as to the effectiveness of such a screening process, especially since not everyone owns a smartphone with the required app. A Weibo post by state media people.cn seeking public opinion on the plan received a mixed response, with some indicating support but many others commenting \"I disagree.\"\n\n\"There are still many elderly people who do not use smartphones,\" said one Weibo user. \"Once implemented, there will no doubt be congestion and queues in public places [to scan the code]. The risk of infection will be higher,\" said another.\n\nAnother city, the Zhejiang provincial capital of Hangzhou, is requiring residents to log their health status into a web page every time they return home. If they report symptoms that suggest possible coronavirus infection, the system automatically flags them for seven or 14 days of quarantine.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news",

capacity.\n\nThe DOD stressed that these facilities are a tertiary option that they can use as a back-up. Some of the bases include the Great Lakes Training Center Navy Base in Illinois, Fort Hamilton in New York, and the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in Texas. Each location will house a maximum of 20 people who need to go under quarantined observation.\n\n\"DOD personnel will not be in direct contact with the evacuees and will minimize contact with personnel supporting the evacuees,\" the agency announced in a news release. \"Should routine monitoring of the evacuees identify ill individuals, HHS has procedures in place to transport them to a local civilian medical facility.\"\n\n\"HHS will also ensure that no evacuated personnel are transferred to any DOD installation if they are infected or ill,\" it continued. \"The department continues to work closely with its interagency partners, while monitoring the situation.

Dr. Nancy Knight of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, following their release. \"They pose no health risk to themselves, to their families, to their places of work, to schools or their communities -- no health risk of novel coronavirus from these individuals whatsoever.\"\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak remains an international health emergency as classified by the World Health Organization.

Response: 'People Behaved Very Badly'", "body": "Communist Party officials said on Tuesday they found local officials in Wuhan had responded with severe negligence to initial reports of infections of coronavirus and exacerbated the emergency.\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese state propaganda newspaper, quoted a Beijing official at the General Office of the State Council blaming local officials for a particularly embarrassing incident in which Wuhan health workers intended to transfer coronavirus patients from their homes to hospitals - Wuhan officials had told those with symptoms to self-medicate at home for the first month of the outbreak.\n\nAfter weeks of reports of ill patients demanding treatment at hospitals and urging doctors to test them to confirm their condition and being turned away, the Communist Party announced it would take in all patients languishing in their homes at once on Sunday. The result, according to Chinese state media itself, was a disaster:\n\nDue to the lagging work, disorderly liaison and organization of the Wuchang district government, the conditions of the transfer buses were poor and there was no working staff from the community following the car. This led to critically ill patients waiting for a long time and getting emotional.\n\nGlobal Times reporters in Wuhan tagged along with one transfer operation in the city's Wuchang district around Sunday midnight. And they saw that the bus designated for the transfer operation was a public city bus, which was loaded with more than 30 senior patients who were seriously ill.\n\nThe number of patients outnumbered the seats, and some who were standing grew so exhausted that they sat down on the aisle.\n\nThere were no quarantine measures between the bus driver and the patients, and the bus driver himself was not in a standard protective outfit required for contact with critically ill patients.\n\nThe Global Times cataloged the one bus driver suffering \"several emotional breakdowns\" while those he was attempting to transport broke down in tears. After hours of getting lost on the way to the hospital, several patients reportedly collapsed upon getting out of the bus.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party appears to have chosen to be transparent about the horrifying conditions surrounding this transport - unlike the many reports of Chinese police welding families shut in buildings to keep the virus from spread - because it is holding Wuhan officials solely responsible for the chaos.\n\n\"We need to do good things well. How can we turn good things to bad? Why did these Party members and officials responsible for transferring these critically ill patients not follow the car? Wuhan is now in wartime. These people behaved very badly,\" General Office of the State Council, Gao Yu, reportedly berated Wuhan officials \"summoned\" before their Beijing superiors.\n\nGao reportedly ordered higher-ranking regional officials to \"hold those responsible to account in strict accordance with Party discipline and government discipline.\" The Global Times did not list any specific repercussions the individuals identified would face, nor did it name them.\n\nThe stern report criticizing Wuhan officials followed what appeared to be the beginning of a political purge in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, on Tuesday. Communist officials dismissed the head of Hubei's public health commission Liu Yingzi and the Communist Party member overseeing the agency, Zhang Jin, for failing to adequately respond to the crisis. Last week, officials announced their first government firings: the mayor of Huajiahe, a village in Hubei, and the Communist Party secretary of the village.\n\nThe Huajiahe officials were dismissed following the death of a teen boy with cerebral palsy. The boy, identified as Yan Cheng, could not eat, drink, bathe, or engage in other necessary human functions without aid, yet government officials quarantined his family on suspicions of coronavirus contamination, leaving him alone in his home.\n\nThe first official to offer his resignation if needed, Mayor Zhou Xianwang of Wuhan, remains in office at press time. In a press conference in January, Zhou admitted to being aware of the coronavirus outbreak long before instituting measures to protect the public from a larger outbreak, but only announced a city-wide lockdown after 5 million of the city's 11 million residents had left, most on vacation during the Lunar New Year holiday. Zhou also blamed senior Communist Party officials for his secrecy.\n\n\"On one hand, we did not reveal [information] in time; on the other, we did not use effective information to improve our work to a satisfactory level,\" Zhou said. \"Regarding the untimely disclosure, [I] hope everyone can understand. [Coronavirus] is a contagious disease. Contagious diseases have relevant law and information needs to be disclosed according to law.\"\n\nIn addition to the ongoing wave of firings, Beijing deployed a \"task force\" of members of the National Supervisory Committee - dictator Xi Jinping's personal \"anti-corruption\" squad - to investigate the death of Dr. Li Wenliang, who allegedly succumbed to the virus last week at age 34. Wuhan police arrested Li shortly before he fell ill for alerting other doctors to his suspicion that the virus was highly contagious. His death has fueled public anger against the Communist Party, which Party officials have attempted to use to rebrand Li as a Party martyr.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news",

Bathroom Pipes", "body": "Hong Kong health officials on Tuesday evacuated residents from a high-rise apartment building called Hong Mei House because at least five of the city's 42 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus have been linked to the building.\n\nThe authorities believe the virus may have spread through poorly-designed toilets and bathroom pipes in the public housing project.\n\nThe South China Morning Post (SCMP) described the plumbing problem:\n\nA Housing Department policy change has allowed tenants in government flats to alter the pipe design in their bathrooms since 2016, a problem which might have helped the faster spread of the deadly new coronavirus which led to an evacuation of a Tsing Yi housing block on Tuesday, the Post has found.\n\nOpened to residents in 1986, Hong Mei House is one of 13 blocks of flats on the Cheung Hong Estate. The 35-storey building is made up of 840 units in three wings, dubbed a Y2 design.\n\nAccording to the original design of the bathroom, the toilet is located in the centre of the unit, with all outlets, including the waste pipe and vent pipe exposed and connected with the bowl.\n\nHealth officials evacuated over 30 units that had piping systems similar to those in the apartments of a 62-year-old woman and 75-year-old man who became infected. The two infected residents lived ten floors apart, but the virus may have spread between their apartments through the piping system.\n\nThe problem, as Housing Minister Frank Chan-fan explained, is that many residents have altered the safe but ungainly piping arrangement in their bathrooms, creating unsafe situations where \"foul air\" can spread between units because the vent pipes have been retrofitted or disconnected entirely. Newer apartments have their bathroom pipes discreetly hidden inside the walls, so the residents are not likely to modify them.\n\nSuch alterations were not permitted for public housing tenants until the revised guidelines were issued in 2016. The SCMP cited speculation that the rules were changed mainly to relieve some of the burden on the housing department, which lacked the manpower to perform all the inspections needed under the older, stricter guidelines.\n\nChan-fan stressed that the coronavirus did not spread through water pipes and toilets, but rather through air vent pipes bundled into the plumbing system. This clarification was important because the 2003 SARS epidemic was known to spread through faulty plumbing.\n\nMedical researchers are still working to determine how the Wuhan virus spreads. Although direct human contact is normally thought to be necessary, Hong Kong doctors suggested the virus might have passed between the two Hong Mei House apartments when infected fecal matter passed into the altered ventilation system.\n\nCNN reported on Wednesday that the son of the infected 62-year-old woman, his wife, and his wife's father have all been diagnosed with the coronavirus.\n\n\"While the investigation into the building continues, Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection has advised the public to maintain drainage pipes by regularly pouring water into drain outlets - the U-pipes - and to put the toilet lid down before flushing 'to avoid spreading germs,'\" CNN added.\n\nThe SCMP ominously noted that \"similar pipe designs can be found in 48 other public housing estates in the city.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name": "John Hayward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Morning_Post", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South China Morning Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-rise_building", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High-rise building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plumbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toilet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsing_Yi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tsing Yi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tsing Yi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventilation (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microorganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Trenchless_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Trenchless Technology", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Pipes", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Pipes", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Pipes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Pipes", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Smoke_Shops", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Smoke Shops", "wgt": 23}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/GettyImages-1200073981.png", "eventUri": "eng-5505376", "location": null, "shares": {}, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1446724085", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-13", "time": "17:57:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-13T17:57:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-13T17:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/02/13/global-elites-shun-commercial-airlines-look-to-private-jets-as-coronavirus-death-toll-surges/", "title": "Global Elites Look to Private Jets as Coronavirus Death Toll Surges", "body": "Wealthy travelers and major corporate clients are rejecting commercial airline travel and looking to private jets as a way to isolate themselves from the deadly coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe uptick in interest comes as more airlines cut scheduled flights to and from mainland China and Hong Kong in the wake of the spread of the disease that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\nUK-based consultancy Ascend by Cirium said the number of flights scheduled to operate to, from and within China had dropped by 34 percent from Jan. 23 through Feb. 11, Reuters reports.\n\nAt the same time the number of deaths and new cases spiked dramatically on Thursday after authorities changed the way they count infections in a move that will likely fuel speculation that the severity of the outbreak has been under-reported.\n\nThe hard-hit central province of Hubei reported 242 deaths in just one day and 14,840 new patients -- by far its biggest one-day tally since the crisis erupted last month. The jump raised the death toll to 1,355 and the total number of nationwide infections to nearly 60,000.\n\nChina has now placed some 56 million in virtual quarantine in Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, since late last month and restricted movements of millions more in cities far from the epicentre in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus.\n\nAs those restrictions bite, more elite fliers are looking to private jets as a way to exit to China or conduct their activities across the globe, executives say.\n\nFor others, flying privately has always been a way of life.\n\nA South American government asked PrivateFly, a global booking service for charter flights, to set up four flights out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, although the request might not be possible, chief executive Adam Twidell told Reuters.\n\nJackie Wu, president of Hong Kong-based JetSolution Aviation Group, said her company had received a \"significant increase of private flight charter requests,\" from Asia.\n\nThe requests are mostly for flights departing from Hong Kong or China to destinations like Auckland, Taipei, Phnom Penh, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nShe said she cannot fulfill about half of those requests because of travel bans on visitors from China, but the enquiries keep coming no matter, according to the Reuters report.\n\nA similar flood of interest came back in 2014 when fear of the deadly virus Ebola and instability around the world pushed demand for private jet charter flights to new levels.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, private jet demand has never been stronger as their sales continue to defy expectations, with private jet lovers will fork out a combined $248 billion over the next ten years, buying 7,600 private planes\n\nThe users span private, corporate, and government clients including the United Nations and the European Union as well as politicians on the campaign trail.\n\nThe new private jets are expected to be bought by multinational companies and the super-rich over the next decade, each of which will burn 40 times as much carbon per passenger as regular commercial flights, predicted a report by aviation firm Honeywell Aerospace.\n\nAbout 690 new business jets took to take to the skies in 2019 alone, a nine percent increase on 2018, as businesses and the wealthy refresh their fleets with new models released by three of the world's biggest private jet manufacturers.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Powerful' than Terrorism", "body": "World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Tuesday the newly discovered coronavirus ravaging China, or any viral outbreak, can have \"more powerful consequences than any terrorist action\" and encouraged global governments to \"do whatever it can to stop it.\"\n\nThe remarks follow a month of WHO officials initially refusing to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), then discouraging nations from imposing travel bans on China, caving to pressure from the Communist Party. The Party considers travel bans an indication of a lack of trust in Beijing's ability to contain the outbreak and, thus, an insult.\n\nThe WHO has also faced significant condemnation for excluding the nation of Taiwan from its international health response, despite Taipei's proximity to China, the origin nation of the outbreak, and its advanced healthcare infrastructure. As a result, WHO officials have reported erroneous coronavirus patient tallies it received from Beijing, which has no ties to or authority over Taipei.\n\nWHO chief Tedros insisted that global political leaders take the threat of the newly discovered coronavirus as seriously as a political threat.\n\n\"The world, when it talks about terrorism - and imagine the level of preparation and so on; it's immense. To be honest, a virus is more powerful in creating political, economic and social upheaval than any terrorist attack, believe it or not,\" Tedros said during a press briefing Tuesday. \"I was a foreign minister in one of my hats, discussing terrorism and so on but a virus can have more powerful consequences than any terrorist action and that's true. If the world doesn't want to wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one I don't think we will learn our lessons.\"\n\n\"I am reminding the world to use this opportunity to do whatever it can to contain this outbreak; do everything it can and there is time because, as I said, the number of cases in the rest of the world is less than 400 and there is only one death,\" he continued. \"That's a window of opportunity so I'm reminding; there is time, the time is ticking and time is of the essence in this outbreak.\"\n\nTedros thanked the Chinese Communist Party - which took 20 days to alert the public of the outbreak after identifying the source of the new virus and shutting it down - for allegedly creating a \"window of opportunity\" to contain the virus by placing its origin city, Wuhan, and much of the surrounding areas on lockdown and implementing extreme quarantine measures. China has reportedly bolted families in their homes, welded doors shut, and disappeared political prisoners as part of its outbreak response.\n\n\"You strike hard when the window of opportunity is there so that's what we are saying to the rest of the world,\" Tedros explained. \"Let's be serious in using the window of opportunity we have. We shouldn't lose this opportunity. If we lose we will regret it and the opportunity was created because of the serious measures that China is taking in Wuhan and the other affected provinces.\"\n\nMany nations have already taken extensive measures to shut the coronavirus out of their territories, in particular limiting airplane travel from China or rejecting people with passports from Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, from entering. In the most extreme case, North Korea shut its border to foreigners entirely. The United States banned foreign citizens who had been to China in the past 14 days from entering, the typically agreed-upon incubation period for the virus.\n\nThese measures were taken against Tedros' initial wishes. In January, the WHO director-general said the organization \"opposes any restrictions for travel and trade\" against China. The WHO as an organization has urged caution in limiting the mass transit of people worldwide.\n\n\"Evidence on travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic for more than 24 hours shows that such measures may have a public health rationale at the beginning of the containment phase of an outbreak, as they may allow affected countries to implement sustained response measures, and non-affected countries to gain time to initiate and implement effective preparedness measures,\" the WHO noted in its Tuesday report on the outbreak. \"Such restrictions, however, need to be short in duration, proportionate to the public health risks, and be reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.\"\n\nCommunist Party officials have pounced on these remarks to scold countries that protect their citizens through restricted travel measures, branding them racists.\n\n\"Despite the World Health Organization's recommendation against limiting trade and travel, some governments have banned Chinese nationals from entering their borders,\" the Chinese state propaganda newspaper Global Times reported last week. \"It is crucial that China is aware of the importance

"Chinese Cities Seize Personal Property to Control Spread of Coronavirus", "body": "Shenzhen and Guangzhou, two of China's largest cities, have been granted the authority to \"requisition\" personal property in order to halt the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\nThe move is especially noteworthy because those two cities are key elements of China's high-tech economic engine.\n\nShenzhen and Guangzhou are located in Guangdong province, which has been hit by the most coronavirus cases outside Hubei, where the epidemic began. As of Wednesday, Shenzhen reported 375 confirmed infections and Guangzhou reported 317, while the province has a total of 1,177.\n\nIn both of the big Guangdong cities, legislators approved emergency measures that would enable officials to temporarily seize homes, commercial property, public venues, and vehicles thought to be contaminated, as well as commanding private businesses to produce any materials deemed necessary in fighting the coronavirus. Shortages of medical equipment and protective gear have been a persistent problem in areas where the virus is spreading, and shortages of food and supplies for quarantined populations are becoming a serious issue.\n\nShezhen's emergency legislation also gives the city government broad powers to shut down commercial operations, public events, schools, and other venues where the virus could spread rapidly.\n\nGuangdong's provincial legislature is considering similar measures, with more of an emphasis on emergency quarantine measures and transportation restrictions than seizing private property.\n\nGovernment officials seizing personal property might not seem like a big story in a Communist country, but laws that semi-approved the ownership of property passed over a decade ago played a major role in China's rapid economic expansion. The emergency measures passed in Guangdong mark the first time local governments have seized property since the passage of the 2007 Property Law.\n\nThe Property Law included provisions for just this type of emergency seizure, with requirements that the property must be returned and the owners duly compensated. The Epoch Times on Tuesday noted some apprehension in China's tech hub cities that the ruling regime might not honor those commitments, especially if the economic damage from the coronavirus epidemic is severe:\n\nHeng He, a U.S.-based political affairs commentator, expressed skepticism about such measures. Although similar emergency policies have been utilized in other countries, Heng expressed concern about the regime's capacity to honor its pledge to provide compensation.\n\n\"Doesn't matter whether this is consistent with the constitutional law, the Chinese Communist Party doesn't even obey their own laws,\" he said.\n\nHeng said the policy appeared to be a new way for Guangdong authorities to \"rob riches from the public.\"\n\n\"Even though they said there will be compensation, a lot of people have experienced such compensation during forced demolition -- a lot are symbolic,\" he said.\n\nForced demolition campaigns have been a recurring issue in China over the past two decades. According to a 2019 report by Beijing Shengting Law Firm, at least 751 complaints were filed from 2014 to 2017 over forced demolitions; and in 43 percent of the cases the officials did not follow any legal procedures.\n\nChina also has persistent problems with corruption, despite endless high-profile campaigns against it. The Epoch Times cited reports of local officials already abusing quarantine situations for profit, such as by demanding bribes to enter restricted areas or bypass checkpoints. This misbehavior also calls the effectiveness of China's much-touted lockdowns into question, since people infected by the coronavirus are no less capable of paying bribes than healthy people.\n\nThe fact that China's prestige economic zone is passing emergency laws to seize property has been taken by skeptical observers, both within and outside China, as another sign that the epidemic is much worse than Beijing is willing to admit. At the moment, the official line from the Chinese government is that the epidemic will peak in February and will effectively end by April.\n\nAnother sign of desperation spotted by Quartz on Monday is a risky gambit in several Chinese cities to flush out coronavirus sufferers in hiding by refusing to sell them fever and cough medicine.\n\nThe brutal calculation is that people who have been hiding their infections and self-medicating - which the Chinese government explicitly told them to do at first - will be forced to reveal themselves and seek treatment from doctors.\n\nCritics of the policy fear it will be counter-productive because it will force people with illnesses other than the Wuhan virus to expose themselves to the deadly epidemic by visiting hospitals and clinics full of infected people. Even worse, those overwhelmed medical centers often send patients home without treatment or testing and tell them to self-medicate, so many people will be compelled to expose themselves to the Wuhan virus for nothing.\n\n\"Is this policy reasonable? People could originally resolve the illnesses with drugs instead of going to hospitals to grab already stretched medical resources and being infected by others who have the virus,\" one Chinese social media commentator noted.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name": "John Hayward", "type": "author",

Criticism", "body": "The People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China conducted naval and air drills near Taiwan on Monday in an intimidation operation against Taiwanese \"secessionists.\"\n\nThe bullying came after Taiwan outspokenly criticized China's handling of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak and pressed for participation in the World Health Organization (WHO) over Chinese objections.\n\nTaiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen last week slammed China for mismanaging the evacuation of Taiwanese citizens from the Wuhan outbreak area, demanded control over how Taiwanese passengers are prioritized in future evacuation flights, and stressed the importance of allowing Taiwan back into WHO. China opposes membership or even observer status for Taiwan because it does not want international organizations to recognize Taiwan as an independent nation-state.\n\n\"We in Taiwan are on the front line of epidemic prevention and deserve the respect of the international community. In particular, our participation in the WHO is the key to a very important network for international epidemic prevention work,\" Tsai said on Friday.\n\nTaiwanese passengers on the first evacuation flight home from Wuhan were outraged to learn an infected person slipped past haphazard Chinese testing and flew to Taiwan with them.\n\n\"They didn't do any blood tests before we got on the plane, just a body temperature check. They let anyone on the plane whose temperature wasn't raised, and there was no protective clothing or isolated seats. We didn't find out until we got to Taiwan that there was a confirmed coronavirus patient on the plane. I'm really angry: how could they have behaved like that?\" one of the Taiwanese passengers said of the Chinese.\n\nTaiwan grounded most air travel from China last week and mandated a 14-day quarantine for visitors arriving from Macau and Hong Kong. Taiwan has advised its citizens to avoid travel to those semi-autonomous cities unless absolutely necessary and advised caution when visiting Singapore or Thailand. Taiwan has reported 18 cases of Wuhan coronavirus infection to date.\n\nChina's state-run Global Times reported Tuesday on China's latest military maneuvers near Taiwan, which were described as an effort to intimidate \"separatists\":\n\nFor two consecutive days, concentrated military operations surrounding Taiwan have demonstrated PLA's capabilities to solve the Taiwan question by force amid Taiwan secessionist plans, experts said.\n\nNaval and air forces with the PLA Eastern Theater Command on Monday conducted joint drills in the southeastern waters of the island of Taiwan, said Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a PLA Eastern Theater Command spokesperson, in a statement released by the Ministry of National Defense on Monday.\n\nCiting Taiwan's defense authority, Taiwan news website udn.com reported on Monday that PLA aircraft including H-6 bombers and fighter jets crossed the Bashi Channel on Monday morning flying into the western Pacific, and returned on the same course.\n\nThe joint drills on Monday came only one day after PLA forces conducted a combat readiness drill on Sunday with warships, bombers, jet fighters, and early warning aircraft. The combat planes cruised through the Bashi Channel and Miyako Strait and conducted real combat-oriented training.\n\nUnlike Sunday's operation, PLA fighter jets crossed the \"middle line\" of the Taiwan Straits on Monday, udn.com said.\n\nSong Zhongping, a mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Monday the concentrated PLA drills are not only warnings to Taiwan secessionists, but also demonstrations of PLA capabilities to solve the Taiwan question by force.\n\nThe Global Times pushed the notion that Taiwanese \"separatism\" and \"collusion with the United States\" is getting markedly worse, obliging the PLA to flex its muscles and let Taipei know it could invade at any time.\n\nPresident Tsai's recent re-election, a landslide victory over a more pro-China candidate fueled in part by the Hong Kong political crisis, certainly did not please Beijing. The coronavirus is weakening China's grip on Taiwan and Hong Kong further by physically isolating the islands and portraying Chinese leadership in a negative light.\n\nMounting international pressure will further irritate the Chinese Communist Party, particularly in matters such as Taiwanese participation in the World Health Organization. Beijing will never relent and allow Taiwan to join, or admit that it was wrong to block Taiwan for so long, while the rest of the world grows more perturbed with China's political intransigence in the face of a massive health crisis. Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu last week accused WHO of violating its own mission statement by bowing to Chinese demands and excluding Taiwan.\n\nThe open question is if Chinese paranoia about Taiwanese \"secessionists\" will be heated up to the boiling point by the coronavirus epidemic, or whether China will feel obliged to demonstrate its power and alleviate its embarrassment by doing something provocative with respect to Taiwan and Hong Kong.\n\nChina may also conclude that the coronavirus has spoiled any chance of political victory for pro-Beijing forces in Taiwanese politics for a long time to come, which might lead it to act aggressively because chances of peaceable \"reunification\" on Chinese terms have evaporated. The political fallout from the epidemic will likely outlive the virus itself.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Powers", "body": "The British government has declared Coronavirus a \"serious and imminent threat\", a classification which gives the secretary of state for health emergency powers to detain people suspected of being infected, as four more cases emerge.\n\nUntil now, the roughly 250 Britons quarantined at two hospitals after arriving back into the United Kingdom from China have been in isolation voluntarily on the advice of the government. But With the declaration \"that the incidence or transmission of novel Coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health\", the hospitals in the UK become legally recognised as \"isolation\" areas, the Department of Health said in a statement.\n\nThis means the government can now keep people in isolation \"for their own safety\", even if it is against their will, a spokesman for the department said.\n\nState broadcaster the BBC reports this change in stance from the government came as one individual in the Wirral quarantine hospital was planning to leave against the advice of doctors before his two week incubation period isolation was complete. The Secretary of State for Health Matt Hancock declaring Coronavirus a \"serious and imminent threat\" permits the government to detail that individual and others to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nThe government statement claimed the move is \"considered as an effective means of delaying or preventing further transmission of the virus.\"\n\nDespite kicking up the classification of Coronavirus up a notch to serious and imminent, the overall threat level to the public issued by the government remains at \"moderate\", while risk to individuals is \"low\". When these threat levels were set in January, the Chief Medical Officer said in a statement that \"This does not mean we think the risk to individuals in the UK has changed at this stage, but that government should plan for all eventualities.\"\n\nThese developments come as another four UK cases of Coronavirus were announced Monday morning, bringing the national total to eight. There have been no UK fatalities from the virus.\n\nSeven of these cases so far have been infected by one person, the eight patient who has been dubbed a \"super spreader\". The so-called super spreader is a UK businessman who caught Coronavirus in Singapore before passing it on to seven other people on a ski holiday in France before returning to the United Kingdom, at which point he began to show symptoms.\n\nBritish newspaper The Daily Telegraph reports UK health authorities are attempting to track anyone who \"two metres of him for more than 15 minutes in the two weeks before his diagnosis\".

"title": "China: The West Is 'Overreacting' to Coronavirus with 'Falsehoods'", "body": "China's state media continued hectoring the Western world about \"overreacting\" to the Wuhan coronavirus with a Global Times editorial on Tuesday that accused the United States of fabricating virus horror stories to \"tarnish the image of China.\"\n\nIn this latest version of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) coronavirus spin, the Western world is overhyping the threat of the Wuhan virus because it suffers from \"some sort of pending-replacement anxiety\" as magnificent China rises to become the new global hyperpower.\n\nThe editorial underplays how serious the Wuhan virus turned out to be, despite the CCP's early efforts to hide the epidemic, the increasingly drastic steps it has taken as the true extent of the threat became undeniable, and the authoritarian regime's ham-fisted attempts to silence critics and whistleblowers:\n\nNo matter what happens in China, the West leaves no stone unturned to mislead the world as it spreads negative, twisted falsehoods. The West has already proven its vindictive and anxious mentality with a large-scale propaganda war against China. Western media constantly wages smear campaigns against the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Xinjiang and Tibet, two of China's autonomous regions.\n\nFrom the very inception of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province, the West - the so-called saviors of humanity and guardians of human rights - has shown its ugliest face to the world. They have acted out of their old habits as they demean China and its people. But China has taken swift, effective and successful measures to curb the outbreak of NCP. The Chinese government has spared no efforts in this regard, including quarantining cities and constructing a 1,000-bed hospital in just 10 days.\n\nChina has stopped at nothing in its attempt to prevent the further spreading of the virus and safeguard the world from the contagion. China's comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures have helped the world make necessary preparations to prevent and control the spread of the epidemic.\n\nLike most CCP spin, the Global Times cited politically useful statements from the World Health Organization (WHO) to the effect that China has done a great job of controlling the epidemic, so draconian measures like travel bans and evacuating foreign citizens from the outbreak area are unnecessary. The rest of the world has ignored WHO's advice on these subjects with remarkable consistency, scrambling to shut down travel to China and get foreigners out of Hubei province as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Global Times accused the West of \"fishing in troubled waters\" and \"overreacting\" to the coronavirus with these measures, with especially harsh criticism for the U.S. travel ban.\n\n\"The Western media have been running news of the epidemic as if the Chinese and China-made products are themselves the virus. Some of them are trying to establish that the coronavirus is made in China. The West is doing its utmost to create panic in China and to demonize Chinese people. They would like to hamper trade and business in China, thereby isolating the second-largest economy from the rest of the world,\" the Chinese state paper charged.\n\nThis was followed by the most bizarre argument deployed by the CCP, namely that concerns about the coronavirus are overhyped because there are so many illnesses and deaths from the flu and other diseases. Flip that argument around: why would countries already dealing with millions of cases of influenza wish to import a new and even more virulent disease from China, adding to their medical woes, especially when the CCP has clearly been dishonest about how contagious and deadly the Wuhan virus is?\n\nIt is not easy to reconcile the Global Times' politicized allegations of \"overreaction\" with China's much-hyped videos of tanker trucks spraying bleach across entire cities to disinfect them. The death toll in China passed 1,000 on Tuesday, with 42,708 admitted infections, plus 393 cases outside China with one known fatality. Those low numbers outside China are encouraging, and clear evidence that the rest of the world is not overreacting to the threat.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":
