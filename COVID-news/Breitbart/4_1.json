Even as the New York state courts have deemed the sex offenders likely to re-victimize children, they were released.\n\nPatrick Phelan, the chief of police in Greece, New York, told WIVB 4 that his office was not notified by state officials of the sex offenders' release, though the state has placed them in a local Holiday Inn Express.\n\n\"We weren't told by anyone. I think good practice would be if you're going to release convicted felons,\" Phelan said. \"Some of them very violent some of those level 3 sex offenders, You might want to give law enforcement the heads up.\"\n\nCuomo's Department of Corrections and Community Services defended their decision in a statement to local media, saying, \"This significant action is being taken in response to a growing number of COVID-19 cases in local jails over the past few days and weeks.\"\n\n\"Our top priority remains the public health and safety of New Yorkers during this global public health emergency and this measure will further protect a vulnerable population from contracting and transmitting this infectious disease,\" a department official said.\n\nThe move comes as Cuomo has ordered the release of 1,100 inmates who have broken the terms of their parole in fear that the convicts may contract the coronavirus in prison.\n\nIn New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed to free 375 inmates back into the general public. At the federal level, 14 Republican and Democrat Senators -- including Mike Lee (R-UT), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) -- have urged the Justice Department to free felons who are over the age of 60-years-old.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_binder@breitbart.com", "name": "John

Soros Groups Pushing Democrat Scheme for Mail-In Voting", "body": "Progressive organizations, many backed by billionaire activist George Soros, are at the front lines of a campaign advocating for a \"vote by mail\" system in the upcoming presidential election, citing fears that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic makes it too dangerous to vote in person.\n\nPresident Donald Trump warned that voting by mail would hurt the Republican Party, lambasting Democrat proposals for more money in the coronavirus stimulus bill to fund absentee and vote-by-mail options.\n\n\"The things they had in there were crazy,\" Trump said. \"They had things - levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\"\n\nAnalysts have posited that such proposals help the Democratic Party. Republicans specifically fear the prospect of voter fraud, since mail-in voting would be much harder to authenticate.\n\nSoros's Open Society Foundations have long sought to change the way Americans vote, also funding groups looking to expand the use of electronic and online voting systems nationwide.\n\nLeading the mail-in ballot charge is the Brennan Center for Justice, located at NYU School of Law. The Brennan Center is heavily financed by Soros's Open Society Foundations and is the recipient of numerous Open Society grants. Breitbart News previously reported the Brennan Center was listed in leaked Open Society Foundations documents as receiving funds specifically earmarked for \"litigation to expand access to registration and improve ease of voting.\"\n\nAlongside the Brennan Center are a slew of progressive groups tied to Soros money that are working overtime to push mail-in voting. Some of the groups are using the coronavirus crisis to advocate permanent changes to the way Americans vote.\n\nThe Brennan Center released a blueprint for voting reform, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, that has been widely cited by news media as making a central argument for a universal vote-by-mail option.\n\nThe Brennan document was spotlighted by such outlets as the New York Times, Washington Post, Axios, Politico, the Guardian, and Reuters among many others.\n\nDemocrat Sens. Amy Klobuchar (MN) and Chris Coons (DE) cited the Brennan Center's coronavirus voting plan in a letter to House and Senate leaders, urging extra funding for the scheme. Klobuchar and Coons are among over a dozen Democrat senators who introduced a bill last month to allow for the widespread mail-in ballots, along with other updated voting measures for the upcoming presidential election. Democrat Reps. Suzan DelBene (WA), Earl Blumenauer (OR), and Jamie Raskin (MD) introduced a companion bill in the House.\n\nThe Brennan Center's plan calls for a \"universal vote-by-mail option for all voters.\" It advocates for \"inactive and recently purged voters (who may have been improperly removed from the rolls)\" to be sent provisional ballots by mail if they request a mail-in ballot.\n\nThe Brennan blueprint calls for expanded online voter registration and allows for mail-in ballots to be processed prior to the close of polls on Election Day.\n\nThe document lobbies for polling place modification and preparation including \"same-day registration, real-time address updates, and provisional balloting for certain individuals.\" Brennan doesn't define which \"certain individuals\" should receive same-day registration.\n\nBrennan also advocates expanded early voting, with states offering at least two weeks of early in-person voting or a minimum of five days.\n\n\"This would be a massive undertaking but I think it's absolutely necessary to make sure that we are prepared to run our elections in November, and I think all the problems we have been having in primaries in the last few weeks is evidence we need to start now,\" said Lawrence Norden, the director of Election Reform at the Brennan Center and one of the report's authors.\n\nThe Soros-funded Brennan Center's mail-in ballot plan was weaponized by the Stand Up America activist group, which launched a nationwide program urging Americans to nudge Congress to fund the voting changes. The group's activities reportedly resulted in more than 19,000 calls to congressional offices in one day alone.\n\nStand Up America is funded by the Sixteen Thirty Fund, which is managed by the shadowy Arabella Advisors, a for-profit consultancy funded by far-left donors. The Soros-funded Democracy Alliance recommended that donors invest several million dollars into Sixteen Thirty Fund.\n\nThe massively Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which routinely partners with Brennan, has been pumping materials urging coronavirus voting legislation that pushes mail-in voting.\n\nSoros's Open Society Foundations donated $50 million to the ACLU. The Brennan Center has been the recipient of numerous grants from Soros's Open Society Foundations totaling over $7,466,000 from 2000 to 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of progressive groups are reportedly mounting a multimillion-dollar campaign to not only change the presidential election system to mail-in voting during coronavirus, but to keep the mail-in balloting as part of the permanent way Americans will vote in the future.\n\nThe other groups in the mail-in advocacy coalition include the National Association of Non-Partisan Reformers, Public Citizen, Common Cause, National Vote at Home Institute and the Center for Secure and Modern Elections.\n\nCommon Cause is funded by Soros's Open Society Foundations. So is Public Citizen.\n\nThe Center for Secure and Modern Elections is a project of the left-leaning New Venture Fund, which doesn't disclose its donors.\n\nThe National Vote at Home Institute is partnered with the Soros-funded League of Women Voters, as well as the Soros-funded Common Cause.\n\nThe National Association of Non-Partisan Reformers lists its founding organization members as including FairVote. FairVote is a project of the Soros-funded Center for Voting and Democracy.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Illegal Aliens", "body": "Democrats on Friday introduced a measure to amend the $2 trillion CARES Act, extending the cash payment benefit to non-citizens, including illegal aliens.\n\nThree House Democrats, Reps. Lou Correa (CA), Judy Chu (CA), and Ra\u00fal Grijalva (AZ), introduced the Leave No Taxpayer Behind Act designed to amend the cash payment portion of the CARES Act -- the $2 trillion emergency economic relief measure designed to help U.S. citizens who are facing economic hardship caused by the coronavirus pandemic -- to extend to non-citizens.\n\nCurrently, the CARES Act requires recipients to have a Social Security number. ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers) taxpayers, which include foreign nationals and those residing in the country illegally, are not eligible and will not receive cash assistance. That is an \"egregious error,\" according to the Democrats' press release.\n\n\"The Leave No Taxpayer Behind Act amends the CAREs Act to ensure that all taxpayers are eligible for their $1,200 relief check,\" the release states:\n\nEvery individual taxpayer irrespective of citizenship status should receive government assistance. With more than 140,000 coronavirus cases in the United States, it is imperative we come together. This pandemic has led to the closure of many small businesses, which will have a disproportionate impact on immigrants. The \"Leave No Taxpayer Behind\" Act will ensure immigrants critical to our economy are not forgotten.\n\n\"I was appalled to learn hardworking, taxpaying immigrants were left out of the $2 trillion CARES Act,\" Correa said in a statement:\n\nThese taxpayers work in critical sectors of our economy, like agriculture, and contribute greatly to our country. While many of us sit at home, these hardworking immigrants are still at work in our hospitals, our fields, and countless other industries. The coronavirus doesn't care about a person's wealth, job, or immigration status. By casting out immigrants, we are placing some of our most vulnerable residents in grave danger. Every individual taxpayer, irrespective of citizenship status, needs government assistance now.\n\nChu agreed, proclaiming that the U.S. economy cannot survive the crisis by \"excluding entire segments of the population\" and added that the virus \"does not care about immigration status.\"\n\n\"Immigrants -- regardless of their status -- are taxpayers who are working in some of the most important jobs keeping our economy running during this difficult time. COVID-19 doesn't discriminate,\" Grijalva said, echoing his counterparts.\n\n\"Our relief programs shouldn't discriminate against those who need help during this crisis, and this legislation ensures that immigrants with ITINs can get the economic relief they deserve,\" he continued.\n\nCosponsors of the legislation include key members of the far-left \"Squad\" -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN).\n\nOcasio-Cortez was among the first to issue a public complaint on benefits failing to extend to non-citizens, whether lawful or unlawful.\n\n\"To clarify, $1200 checks are ONLY going to some w/social sec numbers, NOT immigrants w/ tax IDs (ITINs),\" she wrote after the Senate unanimously passed the bipartisan bill. \"Thanks to GOP, these checks will be cut off the backs of *taxpaying immigrants,* who get nothing\":\n\nThe bipartisan bill, which President Trump signed last week, will provide a $1,200 check to U.S. citizens making up to $75,000 annually. Families making $150,000 per year or less will be eligible for $2,400 in cash relief, with $500 per child.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":

Hours, Say Researchers", "body": "Researchers in Australia report that Ivermectin, an FDA-approved drug commonly used to treat parasites, appears to be effective in treating the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19). The drug is widely available and can be \"repurposed\" for this application, doctors said.\n\nThe ScienceDirect journal, Antiviral Research, published an article by a group of Australian researchers from Monash University in Melbourne reporting that Ivermectin appears to be effective at inhibiting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThe article states:\n\n\"We report here that Ivermectin, an FDA-approved anti-parasitic previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro, is an inhibitor of the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2),\" the researchers write. \"Ivermectin, therefore, warrants further investigation for possible benefits in humans.\"\n\nThe leader of the research team, Dr. Kylie Wagstaff issued a statement, saying, \"Ivermectin is very widely used and seen as a safe drug. We need to figure out now whether the dosage you can use it at in humans will be effective -- that's the next step,\" Newsweek magazine reported. \"We found that even a single dose could essentially remove all viral RNA by 48 hours and that even at 24 hours there was a really significant reduction in it.\"\n\n\"Ivermectin's status as a drug that has already been studied and approved to treat other conditions offers a decided advantage over the development of new drugs, a long process that typically involves many years of studying safety and efficacy before being able to reach human patients,\" Newsweek stated.\n\nDr. Leon Caly, an author of the study and a senior virus identification specialist at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, added, \"As the virologist who was part of the team who were first to isolate and share SARS-CoV-2 outside of China in January 2020, I am excited about the prospect of Ivermectin being used as a potential drug against COVID-19.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization approved the use of Ivermectin in humans to treat onchocerciasis in 1987. \"Ivermectin is safe and can be used on a wide scale. It is also a very effective treatment and has single-handedly transformed the lives of millions of people suffering from onchocerciasis,\" the WHO wrote in an article on its website.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) said Monday he will introduce a bill to create a \"nonpartisan commission\" to study \"our mistakes\" on coronavirus -- which spread while Schiff was leading the effort to impeach and remove the president.\n\nAs Breitbart News has noted, Democrats handed over the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on the very day the first coronavirus victim landed in the U.S. from China. Congress spent the next 20 days on the impeachment trial, led by Schiff as head impeachment manager and chair of the House Intelligence Committee. It was not until Trump was acquitted Feb. 5 that a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee held a hearing on coronavirus.\n\nThroughout the 20 days of the impeachment trial, while Schiff and his team were preoccupied with trying to remove the president from office, Trump took several actions aimed at fighting the coronavirus.\n\nTrump imposed his travel ban on China Jan. 31 -- the day the Senate voted on witnesses in the impeachement trial.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), one of the only legislators to raise the alarm on coronavirus, told the Arkansas Gazette in January that he was breaking the rules and skipping to trial to work with the administration on the coronavirus issue.\n\nSchiff, as chair of the House Intelligence Committee, receives briefings on threats facing the United States.\n\nHis proposed new bill would create a \"9/11 Commission\"-style inquiry into how the U.S. dealt with coronavirus.\n\nSchiff broke the news of his bill with David Ignatius of the Washington Post -- the same columnist who broke the news in January 2017 that incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had spoken with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn had been \"unmasked\" in transcripts of wiretapped telephone conversations.\n\nMuch of Ignatius's article on Schiff's bill focuses on Ambassador Richard Grenell, whom Ignatius accuses -- citing \"[c]areer officials\" -- of \"trying to shape intelligence that might challenge or embarrass Trump\" on coronavirus.

Gives Emergency Authorization of Hydroxychloroquine Use", "body": "The Food And Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency authorization Sunday for hydroxychloroquine, a drug already used to treat malaria and other ailments, which has shown anecdotal efficacy against coronavirus.\n\nThe use of the drug -- often paired with azithromycin -- has not yet been proven in clinical trials to be effective against the disease. However, given reported success in a growing number of small, non-randomized studies; as well as testimonials from doctors and patients about the use of the \"off-label\" drug regimen, doctors are said to be prescribing the treatment to patients who are severely ill. Anecdotally, many doctors are taking it prophylactically.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a statement on Sunday:\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to BARDA to allow hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to be distributed and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible.\n\nHHS also noted that it had \"accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated by Sandoz, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division, and one million doses of chloroquine phosphate donated by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, for possible use in treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 or for use in clinical trials.\"\n\nEarlier, the French government had approved similar drugs to treat the virus.\n\nAmid concerns that the sudden interest in hydroxychloroquine could cause shortages, HHS noted: \"Use of the donated medications is expected to help ease supply pressures for the drug, and the FDA is also working with manufacturers of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to increase production to ensure these drugs also remain available for patients dependent on them for treatment of malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested that hydroxychloroquine could be effective, and has encouraged further study. His interest in the drug has prompted pushback from the media.\n\nNBC News' Peter Alexander accused the president last week of giving Americans \"false hope,\" and Politico's Dan Diamond reported Sunday that the FDA decision came despite \"scant evidence,\" adding that \"[c]areer scientists have been skeptical of the effort.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.

'Decapitate' Economy", "body": "Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh warned Americans Thursday during his broadcast of the Democrats' attempt to use the crisis of the coronavirus as a means to \"decapitate the U.S. capitalist economy\":\n\nSo, they're seeing this as an opportunity to decapitate the United States capitalist economy. And they are salivating over it. For them it's the crisis opportunity of a lifetime to push through their agenda. Despite this, despite the fact that the facts show that it is capitalism and farmers and frackers and truckers who are saving us. People in many industries the left impugns and laughs at and makes fun of, they make fun of farmers, they make fun of people in flyover country, they make fun of people who make their living in the dirt, they make fun of people who take showers after work, they impugn all kinds of people in manual labor jobs. We would be [not] able to survive this without them.\n\nLimbaugh said it is capitalism that is saving the country today. The popular host observed, for example, that by reversing net neutrality, the U.S. saved Internet connectability for emergency periods such as the one the nation is experiencing:\n\nAnd, by the way, thank God for getting rid of net neutrality, because if we hadn't gotten rid of net neutrality and if there were all kinds of these left-wing regulations on the Internet, it wouldn't be up and running as it is today. Go to the U.K., go to the European Union, you'll find out that the Internet and broadband service over there has been greatly interrupted in all this. Because they have massive more regulation of the Internet than we do.\n\nLimbaugh criticized the left-wing media for joining with Democrats in portraying the current rise in unemployment as a failure of the Trump administration.\n\nHe observed MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA): \"Do you think more needs to be done in the next stimulus package now that we've seen these appalling historic unemployment numbers?\"\n\nPelosi responded:\n\nYes. Yes, indeed. And not only do I think so. You can just ask the Democratic and Republican governors. I'm very proud of my governor, Governor Gavin Newsom in California. In this bill we want to include some infrastructure that directly relates to the coronavirus crisis. For example, clean water. Clean water is a very important part of our infrastructure proposal. Community health centers. There's funding for additional money for construction, rehabilitation, et cetera, of community health centers. Internet, broadband. Look at how we're all dependent. And then the grid that makes so much of that possible as part of that.\n\n\"Yeah, the grid. The grid's electricity,\" Limbaugh reacted to the clip:\n\nYou people tried to shut it down with your Green New Deal. What do you mean? You're the biggest hypocrite that's come along during this crisis. Clean water, who the hell is opposed to it? What do you mean we need clean water initiatives in the infrastructure bill? Is there anybody out there in favor of dirty water? Who is opposed to this?\n\nIn the same segment, Limbaugh cited Fox Business Network's Charles Payne, who said Wednesday to his guest, Vice President Mike Pence:\n\nI think the fate of free market capitalism is on the line right now and that the administration and Big Business have got to show the American people that this is the best system. This, to me, is the moment of truth when capitalism is being tested, and it is your administration -- you and President Trump -- that have gotta prove that it is the best way to go about life.\n\nPence agreed, responding that farmers and small businesses are shining stars during the current crisis:\n\nThe fact that you've got farmers in the field working, you got grocery store clerks working the checkout counter? It's keeping food on the table for every American. What you're seeing is the American people are rising to the challenge. Our businesses across the country are rising to the challenge.\n\n\"I am so glad that he mentioned this to the vice president,\" Limbaugh said. \"He's exactly right -- and coming on the face of Gavin Newsom in California. The fate of free market capitalism is on the line right now, and we have shut it down.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"body": "USA Today conducted a fact check Friday in which the media outlet declared as \"true\" the claim that the Obama administration failed to replenish the supply of N95 masks in the Strategic National Stockpile after it had run out in the wake of past health crises.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump said during the White House coronavirus daily briefing that the nation's Strategic National Stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as N95 masks, had been nearly depleted when he assumed office.\n\nIn the previous week, the Daily Wire had published an article that claimed the Obama administration had failed to restock the supply of masks after the H1N1 health emergency:\n\nThe Obama administration significantly depleted the federal stockpile of N95 respirator masks to deal with the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009 and never rebuilt the stockpile despite calls to do so, according to reports.\n\nAccording to USA Today:\n\nWe rate this claim TRUE because it is supported by our research. There is no indication that the Obama administration took significant steps to replenish the supply of N95 masks in the Strategic National Stockpile after it was depleted from repeated crises. Calls for action came from experts at the time concerned for the country's ability to respond to future serious pandemics. Such recommendations were, for whatever reason, not heeded.\n\nOn Sunday, however, the Associated Press (AP) continued to blame the Trump administration for having \"squandered nearly two months that could have been used to bolster the federal [sic] of critically needed medical supplies and equipment.\"\n\n\"Now, three months into the crisis, that stockpile is nearly drained just as the numbers of patients needing critical care is surging,\" AP stated, and received comment from former Obama Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who told the wire service, \"We basically wasted two months.\"\n\nAs USA Today noted, however, on Friday, progressive media outlet ProPublica reported funds that were available to the Obama administration were not used to restock the national supply of masks.\n\nThough ProPublica blames some of the issues surrounding the depletion of the Strategic National Stockpile on \"Tea Party budget battles\" at the time, the article stated:\n\nWith limited resources, officials in charge of the stockpile tend to focus on buying lifesaving drugs from small biotechnology firms that would, in the absence of a government buyer, have no other market for their products, experts said. Masks and other protective equipment are in normal times widely available and thus may not have been prioritized for purchase, they said.\n\nAs USA Today observed, a 2017 study in the journal Health Security found nearly:\n\n... 75 percent of N95 respirators and 25 percent of face masks contained in the CDC's Strategic National Stockpile (\u223c100 million products) were deployed for use in health care settings over the course of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) also stated the country's stockpile of PPE was taxed during hurricanes Alex, Irene, Isaac, and Sandy, and then later during the 2014 outbreak of Ebola and the 2016 zika virus crisis.\n\nThese situations \"continued to significantly tax the stockpile with no serious effort from the Obama administration to replenish the fund,\" reported USA Today.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dr_susan_berry@breitbart.com",

"title": "Nolte: Voting by Mail Is a Terrible Democrat Idea that Invites Fraud", "body": "Democrats want to mail every American a 2020 ballot and have people come to your house to pick up those ballots.\n\nCan you imagine mailing out some 150 million ballots to every registered voter and having some politicized \"organizer\" pick them up?\n\n\"Sir, I'm here to pick up your presidential ballot.\"\n\n\"I haven't filled it out. You know, I'm not really paying attention.\"\n\n\"That's no problem. Why don't you let me help you with that.\"\n\nSeriously, can you imagine?\n\nOr how about the very idea of these \"organizers\" in possession and in control of who knows how many hundreds or thousands of ballots?\n\nDemocrats tried that in Arizona for the 2016 election. But the state passed a law against it, against what is known as \"community ballot collection,\" and the Supreme Court, thankfully, upheld the law, but only after the depraved 9th Circuit ruled against it.\n\nBut this is what Democrats want; this is how Democrats are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic and all the death and economic destruction that goes with it... To push terrible ideas like nationwide vote-by-mail and community ballot collection.\n\nAnyone who believes in election and ballot integrity understands that the safest way to vote, to ensure a legal and orderly process, is in-person voting with a government ID.\n\nWilly-nilly vote by mail is a terrible idea. My God, that would mean mailing ballots to every single registered voter in the country... But only for now. You know that eventually, Democrats will demand that everyone of voting age is mailed a ballot.\n\nSo what you would have are some 150 million presidential voting ballots floating around the country... How many would go to the wrong address? How easy would it be to vote twice: once in person and once by mail? How easy would it be to vote using someone else's ballots?\n\nHow about, this easy! And those are only the people who have been caught.\n\nDemocrats also want to provide \"pre-paid postage for mail-in ballots and extending the postmark deadline to Election Day.\"\n\nCan you imagine?\n\nIf you can postmark as late as Election Day, and you have 150 million ballots floating around, and the polls close in your state at 7 p.m., and the votes are all counted by 10 p.m., and you're a tad short... Good grief, you know, the next move will be to keep the post office open until midnight, so those \"much needed\" ballots can be post-marked on Election Day.\n\nWhile I realize that five states already vote exclusively by mail -- Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Utah -- you at least have to mail the ballots yourself or drop them off at a polling place. Regardless, this is still a terrible idea. If nothing else, it greatly inflates the possibility of fraud and removes the most sacred of traditions: the secret ballot. Once you are behind that curtain, it's just you and your own conscience. Filling out a ballot at home invites coercion and bullying from politicized family-members.\n\nDemocrats are not trying to make voting more convenient for Americans; Democrats are trying to make vote fraud all that much easier.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_nolte@breitbart.com", "name": "John Nolte", "type": "author",

"Multiple reports analyzing the number of urns carrying remains of the dead in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the current coronavirus pandemic originated, distributed this weekend suggests that the Communist Party may be downplaying the true number of dead by at least an order of magnitude.\n\nChina had kept most of Wuhan quarantined for months, welding families shut into their homes and apartments to keep them from contaminating more people. While medical experts have traced the first case of Chinese coronavirus back to Wuhan in November 2019, dictator Xi Jinping did not visit the city of 11 million people until the week of March 10, shortly before the Chinese Communist Party began allowing businesses to reopen and claiming that doctors were not diagnosing any more coronavirus cases in the city. With the city recent reopened, the government finally began allowing families to go to funeral homes and pick up the ashes of their relatives who died of coronavirus infection last week.\n\nCiting funeral home directors and eyewitnesses, multiple reports suggest that the number of urns collected was far larger than that possible if Beijing had accurately reported the number of cases. The Epoch Times, an anti-communist newspaper that has documented skepticism of official government figures from within Wuhan since the onset of the pandemic, estimated over 32,000 deaths attributable to Chinese coronavirus in Wuhan in a report Sunday. The newspaper noted that the urns collected this weekend had amassed between January 23, when the lockdown began, to March 23, when families were first allowed to begin retrieving them.\n\nCiting sources in various Wuhan funeral homes and reports from other outlets such as the independent Chinese media outlet Caixin, the Epoch Times concluded that Wuhan's seven funeral homes possessed 40,000 urns, each urn containing the remains of one person, during the lockdown, suggesting that 40,000 people died in the city during that time. Discounting the average number of deaths a day in Wuhan in 2018, the latest year for which public statistics are available, the newspaper concluded that at least 32,140 people have died of Chinese coronavirus in Wuhan.\n\nThese numbers echoed the warning of funeral directors speaking to the Epoch Times in February, concerned that they did not have the capacity to handle the sheer number of bodies hospitals were sending them. A report in the publication that month found that each Wuhan crematorium was handling as much as five times the normal intake of bodies per day.\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA), an American human rights publication, published an even larger number on Thursday:\n\nChina has documented 82,198 cases nationwide, 67,801 cases in Hubei province generally. China claims 3,308 people have died since the outbreak began in Wuhan, the overwhelming majority - 3,186 people - in Hubei province.\n\nThe official global death toll currently stands at 35,019, or about 11,000 fewer people than RFA's estimate of the number of dead in one Chinese city alone. Beijing claims to have lost fewer people than Spain or Italy.\n\nThe current global number of people confirmed to be infected by the Chinese coronavirus - not counting the \"mild\" cases in Wuhan, of course - stands at 737,929 worldwide.\n\nBoth RFA and the Epoch Times cited locals in Wuhan who said that many of the dead never made it to a hospital. The Chinese government openly admitted that it had stopped counting \"mild\" cases of Chinese coronavirus in its official tallies in February, potentially leaving tens of thousands of people with confirmed coronavirus cases out of the numbers that global public health authorities are using to study just how contagious and deadly the virus us. Beijing also never defined what \"mild\" means, potentially leaving that interpretation up to Communist Party politicians rather than healthcare professionals.\n\nFuneral home directors also revealed, anonymously, that the number of death certificates telling them the bodies they received were of people who died of \"pneumonia\" - a common complication in Chinese coronavirus victims, though not one unique to the virus - had begun skyrocketing, making them suspect that these bodies were incorrectly marked to ensure they did not count towards Beijing's coronavirus death toll.\n\nThe Communist Party is working to mitigate embarrassment in the event of an explosion of new cases in Wuhan as businesses and public transport reopens by claiming that there is potential for a \"second wave\" of infections triggered by foreigners coming to China from countries with a high number of Chinese coronavirus cases. Locals have insisted for weeks, however, that the first wave never abated. The Epoch Times published video Sunday of Wuhan residents collapsing on the group, clearly infirm, suggesting these individuals are suffering from an infection and not receiving care. Their presence in public exposes others to infection, as scientists believe water droplets in the air breathed out by infected people can spread to others near them.", "source": {"uri":

to Japan Hagerty: China Handling of Coronavirus 'Crime of the Century' -- 'Greatest Cover-Up in Human History'", "body": "China's handling of the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic has raised questions about the communist nation's priorities, where it seemingly put its own domestic politics ahead of the global public health. According to former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty, a GOP candidate for U.S. Senate in Tennessee, that decisionmaking by the Chinese government was criminal.\n\nDuring an interview that aired on Friday's broadcast of \"The Jeff Poor Show\" on Huntsville, AL radio's WVNN, Hagerty laid out China's ambitions and noted it put public relations ahead of human lives.\n\n\"China was behind every tree and under every rock,\" he said. \"You think about their Belt and Road Initiative. You think about the things they are trying to accomplish there. They're basically and use their economic might to make very strategic positioning all along critical trade routes. And they have built a military powerhouse out there while many previous administrations have watched. President Trump has taken a very different approach to this, and it was my great honor to serve as his representative in Japan as we began to build the bulkhead there and really watch an important strategy with the Japanese to push back and make the United States the partner of choice in that region.\"\n\n\"But I've worked with China and seen how they operate for years. And I can tell you, what they're trying to do right now with this Wuhan virus is the crime of the century in my view,\" Hagerty continued. \"I think it's the greatest cover-up in human history.

Gretchen Whitmer Asks Feds for Chloroquine After Reversing Ban", "body": "In an embarrassing reversal, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) has asked the federal government for anti-malaria medication that may help treat the Chinese coronavirus after effectively banning doctors in the state from proscribing it to patients suffering from the deadly illness.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) recently threatened doctors with \"administrative action\" if they prescribed Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus.\n\n\"Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage for patients with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other ailments for which chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are proven treatments,\" read the letter. \"... Again, these are drugs that have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19.\"\n\nHowever, Michigan officials have since scrubbed the threat from the letter and now seek the drugs from the Trump administration, according to Bridge magazine.\n\nDuring a Monday press conference, Whitmer appeared to change her tune, stating she wants Michigan to be \"nimble\" with respect to its efforts combating the pandemic.\n\n\"We want to ensure that doctors have the ability to prescribe these medicines,\" the governor said. \"We also want to make sure that the people who have prescriptions that predated COVID-19 have access to the medication they need. And so all of the work that we've done is trying to strike that balance.\"\n\nLast week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved emergency use of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine as a possible coronavirus treatment, concluding that the potential benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n\"Based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA, it is reasonable to believe that chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate may be effective in treating COVID-19,\" FDA Chief Scientist Denise Hinton wrote in the approval letter.\n\n\"When used under the conditions described in this authorization, the known and potential benefits of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate when used to treat COVID-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of such products.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly touted the anti-malaria drugs as a possible treatment for the illness.\n\nWhitmer's about-face comes after she claimed, without evidence, that vendors were being told not to supply medical equipment to Michigan after Trump criticized her handling of the outbreak in her state.\n\n\"When the federal government told us that we needed to go it ourself, we started procuring every item we get our hands-on. But what I've gotten back is that vendors with whom we've procured contracts are now being told not to send stuff here to Michigan. It's really concerning,\" she told WWJ News Radio on Friday.\n\nTrump has directed criticism of his own at Witmer, seemingly calling the Michigan governor a half-wit, who \"doesn't have a clue\" about handling the crisis. \"I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor, Gretchen \"Half\" Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesn't have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude!\" the president tweeted.\n\nSince Whitmer's comments, the Trump administration has shipped 400 ventilators to her state.\n\n\"I just spoke with governor of Michigan, had a great conversation and we sent a large number of ventilators to Michigan,\" the president confirmed reporters at his daily White House task force briefing.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, Michigan has 7,615 confirmed coronavirus cases and 259 deaths.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_caplan@breitbart.com", "name": "Joshua Caplan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxychloroquine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydroxychloroquine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chloroquine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Systemic lupus erythematosus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sulfate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phosphate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rheumatoid arthritis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical ventilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/Gretchen-Whitmer.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5650567", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 5230}, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 5230, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6016763122", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-01", "time": "23:21:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-01T23:21:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-01T22:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/04/01/newsom-i-would-be-lying-to-say-trump-hasnt-been-responsive-to-our-needs/", "title": "Newsom: 'I Would Be Lying' to Say Trump 'Hasn't Been Responsive to Our Needs'", "body": "Wednesday on CNN's \"The Lead,\" Gov.

Despite the impeachment of a president and the coronavirus pandemic, the cable channel America used to automatically turn to in times of crisis could not do any better than number 22.\n\nFox News placed eight shows in the top ten and 14 in the top 20. The openly left-wing MSNBC filled those other slots.\n\nCNNLOL finally arrives way behind its cable news competitors, at number 22, with Jake Tapper's basement-rated The Lead, which still only managed to attract 1.387 million viewers. And Tapper probably only did that well because some of President Trump's popular daily briefings aired during his otherwise anemic timeslot.\n\nSean Hannity topped everyone during the quarter with an average of 4.22 million viewers, which more than triples CNN's top show.\n\nIn fact, the only Fox program CNN was able to beat was Fox and Friends First, which broadcasts before dawn and still managed to come in 40th with 721,000 average viewers. The pre-dawn Fox and Friends First humiliated CNNLOL's disastrous morning show, New Day, which was only able to attract 580,000 average viewers.\n\nOverall, Fox News had its biggest viewing quarter in the network's history, averaging 3.4 million primetime viewers and 1.9 million total-day viewers.\n\nCNNLOL was only able to average 1.43 million primetime viewers, with MSNBC coming in at 1.93 million.\n\nFox News beat both combined.\n\nDuring primetime, CNNLOL managed to lose to ESPN (1.43 million compared to 1.5 million), even though sports events have been dead for weeks due to coronavirus cancellations.\n\nIf you want to fully grasp just how bad CNNLOL's ratings are these days, this quarter's hilariously awful primetime numbers represent a 35 percent increase over the first quarter of 2019.\n\nIn total-day ratings -- and again, despite a presidential impeachment and a worldwide pandemic -- CNN could not even attract a million viewers, just 901,000 compared to MSNBC's 1.1 million and Fox's 1.93 million.\n\nBack to the top 20... only six CNNLOL shows averaged over a million viewers, two just barely, and they were all wiped out by Fox and Friends, which managed to average 1.76 million viewers.\n\nAt this point, it is hardly news anymore when CNN performs so poorly. Over the past six years, under the destructive leadership of Jeff Zucker, CNN has become a national punchline -- a disgrace and embarrassment in ratings and reputation.\n\nAnd now, while the country suffers under the health and economic catastrophe caused by the Chinese virus, CNN continues to deliberately lie to and misinform the public.\n\nWhat's more, the increasingly unstable fake cable channel cannot even put what's good for the country and humanity above its own petty and partisan feud with President Trump. CNN is not only blacklisting Trump's daily coronavirus briefings, it's attempting to shame the rest of the media into doing the same.\n\nOne can certainly understand why CNN would want the briefings blacklisted. During Sunday's briefing, a CNN staffer was humiliated in front of the entire country when Trump caught him red-handed deliberately misquoting him. It was a stunning moment, the first time I've ever seen a so-called reporter caught blatantly lying and then forced to prove he lied by eventually reading -- with hands shaking -- the true quote.\n\nDuring Tuesday's briefing, CNN had an even worse moment when Dr. Anthony Fauci explained to CNN's Jim Acosta that the administration did indeed launch its coronavirus mitigation \"very, very early.\"\n\nThat is something CNNLOL wants to hide from the public.\n\nWho wants to watch a so-called news network that behaves in such a craven and dishonest way?\n\nWell, as you can see from the ratings... pretty much no one.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_nolte@breitbart.com", "name": "John Nolte", "type": "author",

Projects", "body": "The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model cited by White House Coronavirus Task Force officials appears to dramatically overstate the hospitalization of patients with coronavirus in the United States when the model's projections are compared to actual data, a Breitbart News analysis finds.\n\nBreitbart News compared projections of the number of regular hospital beds needed to treat coronavirus patients made in the Friday, April 3 iteration of the IHME model for nine states to the actual number of cumulative hospitalizations (a number that includes current regular bed hospitalizations, current ICU hospitalizations, previously hospitalized and released patients, and previously hospitalized and deceased patients) reported by the respective health departments in those states as of Thursday, April 2.\n\nThe results showed that the actual number of cumulative hospitalizations as a percentage of regular hospital beds needed projected by the IHME model ranged from nine percent in Tennessee to 47 percent in Florida.\n\nEven in New York State, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, the actual number of cumulative hospitalizations as a percentage of regular hospital beds needed projected by the IHME model was only 37 percent.\n\nThese numbers, however, actually understate the degree to which the IHME model overestimates the number of hospital beds currently needed for coronavirus patients because the numerator-cumulative hospitalizations-includes data well in addition to the actual number of current regular hospital beds in use for coronavirus patients, since it also includes current ICU hospital beds in use for coronavirus patients as well as previously hospitalized coronavirus patients either released or deceased.\n\nData on cumulative hospitalizations in currently reported by most states, while some provide more detailed information.\n\nThe Department of Public Health in Minnesota, for instance, reported as of April 2 that 46 out of the 156 reported cumulative hospitalizations in the state for coronavirus are patients currently in regular hospital beds, while 40 are patients in ICU hospital beds and 70 are formerly hospitalized patients who have been released or are deceased.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the actual number of cumulative hospitalizations reported by these nine states as of April 2, as compared to the number of regular hospital beds projected for coronavirus patients in those states on April 2 by the IHME model:\n\nColorado: Cumulative hospitalizations of 710 divided by regular hospital bed projections of 3,141 = 23 percent.\n\nOhio: Cumulative hospitalizations of 802 divided by regular hospital bed projections of 2,436 = 33 percent\n\nTennessee: Cumulative hospitalizations of 263 divided by regular hospital bed projections of 2,741 = 9 percent\n\nTexas: Cumulative hospitalizations of 196 divided by regular hospital bed projections of 1,968 = 10 percent\n\nNew York: Cumulative hospitalizations of 20,817 divided by regular hospital bed projections of 56,183 = 37 percent\n\nFlorida: Cumulative hospitalizations of 1,215 divided by regular hospital bed projections of 2,612 = 47 percent\n\nGeorgia: Cumulative hospitalizations of 1,158 divided by regular hospital bed projections of 3,089 = 37 percent\n\nIowa: Cumulative hospitalizations of 138 divided by regular hospital bed projections of 384 = 36 percent\n\nMinnesota: Cumulative hospitalizations of 156 divided by regular hospital bed projections of 823 = 19 percent\n\nNotably, the IHME model's current projections of COVID-19 deaths as of April 2 is in line with the actual number of reported deaths on that date.\n\nBreitbart News provided this data to the media spokesperson for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation on Friday and asked if they could explained why the IHME model's projections of regular hospital beds needed is so badly off the mark from actual beds required for COVID-19 patients up to April 2 but has not yet received a response.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_patrick_leahy@breitbart.com", "name": "Michael

Likely to Be Hospitalised with COVID-19", "body": "Smoking may reduce the likelihood of being hospitalised with coronavirus, claims a study.\n\nHere is the abstract of the study - Smoking, vaping and hospitalization for COVID-19 - by researchers at the University of West Attica in Greece and New York University.\n\nThe study presents an analysis of the current smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, compared to the population smoking prevalence in China (52.1% in males and 2.7% in females). Through a systematic research of the literature (PubMed) we identified 7 studies examining the clinical characteristics of a total of 2352 hospitalized COVID-19 patients that presented data on the smoking status.\n\nThe expected number of smokers was calculated using the formula Expected smokers = (males x 0.521) + (females x 0.027). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed among hospitalized COVID-19 patients (8.7%, 95%CI: 7.6-9.9%) compared to the expected prevalence based on smoking prevalence in China (30.3%, 95%CI: 28.4-32.1%; z-statistic: 22.80, P < 0.0001). This preliminary analysis does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalization for COVID-19, and might even suggest a protective role.\n\nThe latter could be linked to the down-regulation of ACE2 expression that has been previously known to be induced by smoking. However, other confounding factors need to be considered and the accuracy of the recorded smoking status needs to be determined before making any firm conclusions. As a result, the generalized advice on quitting smoking as a measure to improve health risk remains valid, but no recommendation can currently be made concerning the effects of smoking on the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19.\n\nNo studies recording e-cigarette use status among hospitalized COVID-19 patients were identified. Thus, no recommendation can be made for e-cigarette users.\n\nIt makes intuitive sense that smoking ought to exacerbate a respiratory infection such as coronavirus. Indeed, earlier reports in the mainstream media reflected this view when very little was known about coronavirus, pointing out the obvious -- that smoking damages your lungs and so do respiratory diseases.\n\nA recent study also reflects this conventional wisdom. Published in the journal of the International Society for the Prevention of Tobacco Induced Diseases, the March COVID-19 and smoking paper states:\n\n...although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.\n\nBut the authors of the West Attica/NYU study cautiously advance a theory as to why this might not be the case:\n\nSmoking increases susceptibility to respiratory infections and media reports suggest that it may increase the risk of being infected with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is known to use the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry, and there is evidence that smoking down-regulates ACE2 expression in the lung and other tissues.\n\nTheir findings, though surprising, appear to be supported by the latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These too show that - contrary to expectations - relatively few smokers and ex-smokers have been hospitalised with COVID-19.\n\nThe CDC apparently isn't eager to play up the significance of smoking in patient survival outcomes. Nevertheless, it acknowledges in this throwaway comment:\n\nFinally, for some underlying health conditions and risk factors, including neurologic disorders, chronic liver disease, being a current smoker, and pregnancy, few severe outcomes were reported; therefore, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risk for severe COVID-19 among persons in these groups.\n\nNeither the authors of the Smoking, vaping and hospitalization for COVID-19 study nor the CDC are advocating taking up smoking in order to ward off coronavirus. Also, they caveat their findings by noting that this is preliminary data which may be based on incomplete information.\n\nOther studies\n\nFurther, the study authors note that smokers are more likely than non-smokers to 'suffer comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, which are risk factors for adverse COVID-19 outcomes.'\n\nThey conclude:", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType":

"Communist officials in China have hidden the severity of the coronavirus outbreak within their borders, under-reporting both total cases and fatalities linked to the disease, the U.S. intelligence community reportedly confirmed in a classified report to the White House.\n\nWuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, is the birthplace of the novel coronavirus illness (COVID-19).\n\nDuring the early stages of the epidemic in China that was later deemed a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), Beijing hid the extent of the viral outbreak, muzzling and jailing whistleblowers and critics in a move that allowed the disease to gain a firm foothold across the world.\n\nCiting three officials familiar with the classified report issued by the American intelligence community, Bloomberg revealed on Wednesday:\n\nThe officials asked not to be identified because the report is secret and declined to detail its contents. But the thrust, they said, is that China's public reporting on cases and deaths is intentionally incomplete. Two of the officials said the report concludes that China's numbers are fake.The report was received by the White House last week, one of the officials said.\n\nHealth officials detected the first case of the coronavirus in China in mid-November 2019. Yet, the Asian giant has publicly reported fewer cases and fatalities than the United States, where officials diagnosed the first person with coronavirus in late January.\n\nCommunist China has revised its methodology for counting cases several times. For weeks, the country ignored asymptomatic cases entirely. This week, it finally added over 1,500 cases of people without symptoms to its tally.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, lambasted the incomplete Chinese data, saying it misled experts on the seriousness of the deadly and highly contagious disease.\n\n\"I think the medical community interpreted the Chinese data as that this was serious but smaller than anyone expected,\" she declared. \"Because I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data.\"\n\nDr. Birx conceded that when she saw early data from China reporting only 50,000 cases of the coronavirus among the 80 million in Hubei province, she felt that the threat was similar to that of SARS, which had 8,098 cases globally and 774 deaths.\n\nIt was not until information came out of countries such as Italy, Spain, and South Korea that experts began to see the full picture of the disease's devastation, she indicated.\n\nBloomberg acknowledged:\n\nWhile China eventually imposed a strict lockdown beyond those of less autocratic nations, there has been considerable skepticism of China's reported numbers, both outside and within the country.\n\n...\n\nChina is not the only country with suspect public reporting. Western officials have pointed to Iran, Russia, Indonesia, and especially North Korea, which has not reported a single case of the disease, as probable under-counts. Others, including Saudi Arabia and Egypt, may also be playing down their numbers.\n\nOn March 25, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted China's \"intentional disinformation campaign,\" drawing the ire of Beijing.\n\n\"At the beginning of this, when it was clear that this was an issue, China knew about it, they were the first country to know about the risk to the world from this virus, and they repeatedly delayed sharing that information with the globe,\" Pompeo proclaimed.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"body": "In the midst of the Chinese coronavirus crisis, about five-in-six American adults said they want to see the United States end all immigration from Mexico.\n\nThe latest Harvard/Harris Poll asks Americans whether they would support or oppose an immigration moratorium on Mexico during the coronavirus crisis. Overall, 83 percent -- or five-in-six -- said they favor ending all immigration from Mexico at the moment.\n\nThis sweeping support for ending immigration from Mexico includes 75 percent of Hispanic Americans and 77 percent of black Americans. Another 73 percent of Democrat voters said they support ending immigration from Mexico, while 84 percent of swing voters and 93 percent of Republican voters support such a measure.\n\nEven among the most liberal voters, nearly 70 percent said they support ending immigration from Mexico, as well as 74 percent of voters who supported failed Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe poll comes as Mexico's coronavirus cases continue to climb, now reaching nearly 1,000 confirmed infections with 20 deaths and 938 active cases.\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of Americans want to see an end to immigration from Mexico, the State Department has issued waivers that will more quickly fast-track many Mexican workers into the U.S. through the H-2B and H-2A visa programs.\n\nThe directive effectively allows agricultural and nonagricultural businesses to quickly import foreign workers on H-2A and H-2B visas without standard interview and application procedures.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, immigration moratoriums are not uncommon in American history. Currently, there are about 45 million foreign-born residents living in the U.S., a 108-year record high.\n\nThe country's last immigration boom -- between 1900 and 1920 -- was eventually met with a near immigration moratorium. Between 1925 and 1966, the U.S. legal immigration level did not exceed 327,000 annual admissions.\n\nSince major changes were enacted in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson (D) and in the 1990s by President George H.W. Bush (R) -- changes that allow foreign nationals to bring as many foreign relatives to the country as they want -- legal immigration levels have continued booming for about five decades.\n\nToday, about 1.2 million legal immigrants are admitted to the U.S. every year.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_binder@breitbart.com", "name": "John Binder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Insights_&_Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Insights & Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-2B_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H-2B visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-2A_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H-2A visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moratorium_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moratorium (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Kennedy, has also canceled live performances until May 10 as part of the national guidance to limit gatherings to ten people or less.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on the furloughs:\n\nIn a conference call Friday night, Rutter told orchestra leaders that the 96 musicians would receive their last paycheck on April 3 and that they will not be paid until the arts center reopens. In addition, she said their \u00adhealth-care benefits would stop at the end of May if the arts center is still closed at that time. The announcement was characterized by several NSO members as a shock.\n\nThe center put statements about its status on its website, which said, in part:\n\nAs we fulfill our congressional mandate, we rely on ticket revenues and contributions to offset nearly every aspect of our business, including presenting live (often free) performances and offering education programs for millions across the country.\n\nAdditionally, the Center is a job creator, providing employment for nearly 3,000 people and compensation for more than 1,000 guest artists. Our workforce includes artists, programmers, administrative and production staff, ushers, bartenders, food service employees, parking attendants, and many more, all of whom have been impacted or will soon be impacted by the closure of the Kennedy Center. The ability to deliver on our mandated mission is at risk. As a result, federal relief funding is the only way we will be in a position to reopen the nation's cultural center when our government officials tell us it is safe to do so.\n\nThe Kennedy Center is extraordinarily grateful that Congress has recognized our institution's unique status and has included funding in its economic stimulus legislation to ensure that we can reopen our doors and stages as soon as we are able. We will continue to work for and seek the support of our patrons to ensure the programming continues.\n\nThe center also asked for donations on its website:\n\nThough the Kennedy Center is unable to open its doors to you right now, we are making a commitment to our community to use the power of the arts to inspire, unite, and lift each other up during this time of uncertainty.\n\nYour gift today will be used to create digital educational content, provide virtual performance platforms and support for artists, and most importantly, prepare to welcome you back to the Center as soon as possible.\n\nBut critics said the furloughs are unacceptable.\n\nEd Malaga, president of the Local 161-710 of the American Federation of Musicians, said in a Washington Examiner report:\n\nThis decision, from an organization with an endowment of nearly $100 million, is not only outrageous -- coming after the musicians had expressed their willingness to discuss ways to accommodate the Kennedy Center during this challenging time -- it is also blatantly illegal under the parties' collective bargaining agreement.\n\n\"That agreement specifically requires that the Center provide six weeks' notice before it can stop paying musicians for economic reasons,\" Malaga said.\n\nThe Examiner reported that Rutter said she will suspend her $1.2 million salary during the crisis.\n\nThe payroll expense for the National Symphony is $400,000 a week.\n\n\"Rutter said the $25 million fund from Congress would be used for 'essential personnel to ensure we can reopen the center,'\" the Examiner reported.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "penny_starr@breitbart.com", "name": "Penny Starr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.
