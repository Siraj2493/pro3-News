China's carbon emissions have steadily increased, according to climateactiontracker.org, and are projected to keep rising. China is also rapidly building coal power plants, signaling that the country has no intention of ending its status as the number one producer of carbon emissions.\n\nDuring the ninth Democrat presidential debate on NBC on Wednesday, moderator Lester Holt asked what the candidates would do to stop China, which he said was the number one producer of carbon emissions.\n\nBloomberg said, \"In all fairness, the Chinese have slowed down. It's India that is an even bigger problem.\"\n\nHowever, a new study shows that the coronavirus epidemic has cut China's carbon emissions by 100 million metric tons. Bloomberg did not mention the epidemic when making this claim.\n\nBloomberg argued that the United States should convince China to cut its emissions rather than trying to use tariffs to fight the country.\n\n\"What you have to do is convince the Chinese that it is in their interest as well. Their people are going to die just as our people are going to die, and we'll work together,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_spiering@breitbart.com", "name": "Charlie Spiering", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bloomberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bloomberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Holt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lester Holt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Conferences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Catalysts_and_Adsorbents", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Catalysts and Adsorbents", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Carbon", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Carbon", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/GettyImages-1207410679.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5532512", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 2369}, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 2369, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1455594556", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-21", "time": "03:27:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-21T03:27:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-21T03:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/20/watch-brave-chinese-woman-risks-her-life-to-denounce-evil-regimes-handling-of-coronavirus/", "title": "Watch: Chinese Woman Risks Her Life to Denounce 'Evil' Regime's Handling of Coronavirus", "body": "An anonymous Chinese woman courageously posted a video message to her fellow citizens on Sunday in which she called for resistance to the Communist Party, accusing it of destroying countless lives by bungling its response to the Wuhan coronavirus and warning that even now, the Party is primarily interested in suppressing dissent and maintaining power than fighting the disease.\n\nTaiwan News was impressed by the woman's willingness to say just about everything that can get you arrested in China, at a moment when swarms of censors have been unleashed to quash public anger over the coronavirus:\n\nIn the opening of the video, the woman addresses her \"fellow citizens,\" saying that ordinary people are being sacrificed by the \"schemes and plans of the government.\" She complains the government does not care about the average person and that no amount of money can buy the necessary medicine and hospital beds needed to treat the deadly virus.\n\nShe then proceeds to break every major taboo in the CCP censors' book by expressing her support for independence in Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. She condemns the \"evil deeds of the Chinese Communist Party and the corrupt regime, and evil society,\" which she says prevents people from speaking freely.\n\nThe woman points out that anyone who dares to speak about the reality on the ground in Wuhan is quickly rounded up by the police. She says the solution of the authorities is to take people \"to drink tea,\" a euphemism for police interrogation, followed by detention and adjudication.\n\nShe says that those who are sentenced to 10 or 20 years have no recourse and lawyers are \"useless.\" She declares that \"all righteous lawyers have been imprisoned by the government.\"\n\nThe woman was well aware of the implications of her video tirade, and the consequences she could face for posting it:\n\nIncreasingly irate, the woman vows that \"a sacrifice of blood and flesh is necessary for revolution.\" She then boldly swears that to enable her parents and family to live freely, she is \"standing up\" and sacrificing herself.\n\nShe acknowledges that such bold words put her in grave danger, but she nevertheless shouts, \"I already can't take it anymore! I can't take it anymore!\" The woman reiterated that there are no beds or medication for those infected by the virus and claimed that \"all the news from TV is a lie.\"\n\nShe concluded by invoking the spirit of the Hong Kong protest movement and listing other dissidents who have been silenced by the Chinese Communist Party for speaking as she did. The latest dissident to disappear was Xu Zhiyong, a leading legal activist who suddenly went dark last weekend after calling on Chinese dictator Xi Jinping to admit he botched the Wuhan situation and resign. Xu's girlfriend, a noted social activist in her own right named Li Qiaochu, vanished at the same time.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":

coronavirus.\n\n\"I don't disagree that China's scientists and doctors can, in some cases, be world-class, and they can be professional,\" he said. \"However, they have sitting next to them at every

That's why we've seen the numbers of this coronavirus continue to spike in strange, unpredictable patterns. Those aren't newly discovered cases. Those are newly disclosed cases because China is carefully managing the flow of information about this virus.\"\n\nThe Arkansas lawmaker also batted down criticism that he was promoting conspiracy theories by suggesting there was a possibility coronavirus was not \"naturally occurring.\"\n\n\"We know that it didn't start in the Wuhan food market,\" Cotton said. \"That was the original story of the Chinese Communist Party. So it's only responsible to ask where it did start. I still think the most likely hypothesis is it was naturally occurring, but given the proximity of that laboratory to the food market, it is only reasonable that we ask the Chinese Communist Party to be open and transparent about the kind of research they were conducting there, and the safety protocols and practices they had in place.

Tom Cotton (R-AR) ripped establishment U.S. media outlets who have mischaracterized his comments on the origins of the coronavirus outbreak plaguing China and the world during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News this week.\n\nCotton, who this past weekend during an appearance on Maria Bartiromo's Fox News Channel program Sunday Morning Futures laid out how Communist China has not been honest about the origins of the coronavirus, has been the subject of vicious attacks from establishment media in the U.S. as a result.\n\nIn particular, during the Bartiromo interview, Cotton specifically said there is not evidence to suggest that the coronavirus originated in a high-security biochemical lab the Chinese Communist Party government operates in Wuhan. But since the government's original official story about the virus's origin is collapsing under scrutiny, the senator argued that the question needs to be asked -- and that that theory, along with several other more plausible virus origin theories than the Communists' original and likely false claim that the virus originated in a food market, need to be pursued. Cotton argued that the Communists must allow internationally renowned independent western experts into China to investigate the matter.\n\n\"We don't have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China's duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all,\" Cotton said in the Bartiromo interview.\n\nCotton has been aggressive in his criticism of Communist China on coronavirus, as he was in the Fox News interview and in this exclusive interview with Breitbart News. He was also the first U.S. senator to call for President Donald Trump's administration to extend a temporary travel ban to China in order to protect Americans from the disease -- which he did in another Breitbart News exclusive a few weeks ago.\n\nIn his interview with Breitbart News on Monday, Cotton -- who is also launching a new effort to back conservative Republican veterans for Congress -- called on China to allow western experts into Wuhan province in China to investigate coronavirus and its origins.\n\n\"Of course the Chinese Communist Party needs to be open and transparent, and they have not been from the beginning as they still refuse to be,\" Cotton said. \"Just in the past couple days, they released a so-called secret speech from Chairman Xi that he supposedly gave in early January to demonstrate how on top of matters he was blaming the local officials -- an endemic problem to communist government. It was like a parody of historical revisionism, like old-school Marxist Leninists. What the Chinese Communist Party needs to do is open up to internationally recognized experts -- not Iranian experts or even Russian ones, but European and American and Canadian and Japanese -- where there's no question of their credentials or their integrity and allow them into Wuhan, allow them into the food market, and allow them into the super laboratory in Wuhan so they can figure out exactly where this virus came from and we can glean lessons from that to develop effective diagnostic testing and vaccines.\"\n\nBut perhaps more importantly than that, Cotton laid out how the establishment media -- much of which has accused him of spreading conspiracy theories about the coronavirus -- is \"spouting\" Chinese Communist Party propaganda.\n\n\"The second point you make though is about the media, and this is yet again a gross form of mainstream media bias -- they are spouting the party line, and in this case it is the Communist Party line,\" Cotton told Breitbart News. \"They are doing everything they can to be apologists for the Chinese Communist Party when in fact it is in the Communist Party system of government that has inflicted this outbreak upon the world -- and most importantly upon their own people. The Chinese people, after all, are the first and worst victims of the Communist Party government in China. It's time the media start directing these questions not at skeptics in Washington, but begin directing their skepticism towards Chinese apparatchiks in Beijing.\"\n\nFor instance, after the Fox News interview with Bartiromo, the Washington Post's Paulina Firozi wrote a piece that in the headline says Cotton \"keeps repeating a coronavirus conspiracy theory that was already debunked.\"\n\nThe Post piece, however, just quotes a few experts disagreeing with Cotton on his questioning of the matter and does not even address the Communist Party of China's likely false claims that the virus originated in a food market. In response to that story, Cotton sent out a tweet-storm further explaining his questions about the virus origins:\n\nBut, then, the New York Times published its own piece claiming that Cotton was repeating a \"fringe theory\" about the \"origin\" of coronavirus. In it, the newspaper takes the Communists in China at their word about the origins of the virus -- not questioning the false claims it originated in a food market. \"The Chinese authorities say the outbreak began in a market in Wuhan where wild animals were sold,\" the New York Times' Alexandra Stevenson wrote.\n\nThroughout the article, Stevenson repeatedly frames Cotton's questioning of the Communist government in Beijing using words and phrases like \"rumor\" or \"conspiracy theory\" or \"lacks evidence\" or \"has been dismissed by scientists\" to describe what the senator was saying -- while offering no such criticism whatsoever of the Communist Party line.\n\nCotton hit back at Stevenson in a separate tweet:\n\nIn his Breitbart News exclusive interview this week, the senator made clear though that it is unsurprising to see establishment U.S. media outlets like the Washington Post and New York Times -- among the many others attacking him this week -- defending the Communist Party.\n\n\"For years and years and years, China has engaged in a concerted effort to court western media,\" Cotton told Breitbart News. \"China has been paying millions of dollars to the New York Times and Washington Post to run their propaganda sections. And of course, there's always the romance between left-wing reporters and left-wing government, of which communism is the best example, so there's a lot of reasons why the media reflexively defends China, but they have to stop it and they have to hold Beijing to account for the good of the entire world.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":

"title": "Photos: China's City Streets Empty as Workers Avoid Coronavirus", "body": "\"The outbreak will be short-lived, and it will not affect China's competitiveness,\" the state-run Global Times newspaper proclaimed Tuesday.\n\nWhile China insists its economic output remains strong, photos from its major economic hubs show millions-strong cities completely deserted, bringing the Chinese economy to a screeching halt.\n\nAt press time, China has documented 72,439 cases of the newly discovered coronavirus originating in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million people. Of those identified as confirmed patients, 1,870 have died within China, the overwhelming majority. While most of those cases have been confirmed in Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, doctors have confirmed growing numbers of cases in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, some of the most important urban centers to China's economy.\n\nThe Wuhan coronavirus reportedly began spreading in Wuhan in mid-December; the Chinese Communist Party informed the public of the outbreak on January 20. Since then, the virus has spread to every province in the country and to places outside of communist rule like Hong Kong and Macau. To help contain the outbreak, Chinese officials have implemented strict lockdowns forcing many people to work from home. Those who cannot do so, like factory workers who need access to materials and machinery, have simply not been able to work.\n\nIn central Wuhan, the government has banned residents from leaving their homes. Former Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong - a loyalist to dictator Xi Jinping recently appointed head of the Communist Party in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located - implemented a ban from being out in public throughout Wuhan and several other cities in the province. According to the South China Morning Post, Ying imposed what he called the \"strictest 24-hour lock-down management,\" allowing individuals to leave their homes only in cases of emergency and to buy food and necessary supplies every three days. Any exit from a building requires government approval. Needless to say, commuting to work is not on the list of approved reasons to leave the house.\n\nThe Morning Post notes that, in total, over 80 cities nationwide have imposed lockdowns.\n\nFor Shanghai, Ying's former city and one of the most important economic centers in the country, this has meant a near-total shutdown of business activity. A poll found this week that nearly 80 percent of companies active in the greater Shanghai area do not have the necessary number of employees present at work to run their companies. In the next month, 41 percent of companies surveyed said a lack of staff was their biggest concern. Shanghai has documented 333 cases of coronavirus and one death.\n\nShenzhen, the city bordering Hong Kong, has also seen a steep decline in economic activity. Shenzhen's Guangdong province, largely considered the factory center of the country, has documented 1,328 cases of the virus and four deaths, many more cases than the more centrally located Beijing and Shanghai, though the same number of deaths as the national capital. Shenzhen has been deeply impacted by rural commuter workers choosing not to return to jobs where they may be exposed to the virus. Beijing estimates that as many as two-thirds of those workers are not back in factories nationwide, significantly hindering manufacturing.\n\nIn Beijing, the most politically powerful city in the country, largely empty streets suggest a significant disruption in business as usual.\n\nThe Communist Party is so concerned about an outbreak in the capital that it is considering the extraordinary move of postponing the \"two sessions\" - the annual full session of the National People's Congress (NPC), the country's rubber-stamp legislature, and of the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a celebrity advisory committee - until after the viral outbreak is under control. The \"two sessions\" typically bring thousands of high-level politicians together from around the country, potentially exposing them all to the outbreak. While the nominal government reason for considering postponement is to ensure these politicians are in their home provinces working on the outbreak, anonymously some in the government have expressed concern that such a large assembly would spread the illness to some of the Party's most important cadres.\n\nViral infections among government employees are already a concern, as China has attempted to keep government offices open to show that the outbreak is under control. The Global Times reported on Tuesday that 69 people in one Beijing district office have been quarantined after a public worker tested positive for the virus there. The infected employee had traveled to Hubei province for the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nThe Global Times has nonetheless proclaimed that the demise of the Chinese economy is overestimated.\n\n\"The losses are huge, of course, and the specific numbers are yet to be counted, but the absolute numbers are certainly staggering,\" the Times admitted on Tuesday in an article called \"It Is Naive to Expect Chinese Economy to Collapse.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com", "name": "Frances Martel",

"Chang: Huawei Gets into Our 5G, China Gains Control over America", "body": "Integration of Huawei technology in forthcoming 5G networks will enable China to deploy ubiquitous surveillance and control over America and the broader West, warned Gordon Chang, Daily Bast columnist and author of The Coming Collapse of China, in a Monday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.\n\n\"In London and in many other capitals, China has bought the elites,\" said Chang, referring to some Western political elites' inexplicable decisions to include Huawei [technologies] in telecommunications infrastructure development,\" adding, \"[Huawei] is used by Beijing to spy.\"\n\nChang continued, \"If Huawei is embedded in 5G networks, they'll scoop up the world's data. They'll be able to control the world's devices on the Internet of things. 5G is where much of the future is determined, and we are very, very, very far behind China.\"\n\nRetired Air Force Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding offered a similar warning when explaining how Huawei would be used by China to manipulate and surveil Western populations if partnered with Western telecommunications companies and authorities on 5G network development projects.\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus outbreak in China reaffirms the rationale behind President Donald Trump's foreign policy goal of decoupling the American and Chinese economies, stated Chang.\n\n\"Trump's efforts over the years -- starting in 2017, almost as soon as he took office -- to protect American supply chains [from dependence on China] are really good,\" Chang said. \"The coronavirus epidemic shows the wisdom of President Trump's approach.\"\n\nChang added, \"Right now, we're seeing container ships leave China ten percent full, which is obviously a lot less than normal. ... The result of this is we are going to move our supply chains out of China, which is absolutely a good thing for a number of reasons, but also we're going to be making stuff much closer to home -- this is proximity manufacturing -- which now, seems to be quite wise.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) has entertained the possibility of a relationship between the coronavirus's origin and a virology institute in Wuhan, China. Chang indirectly referred to derision of Cotton's considerations from the New York Times, Washington Post, MSNBC, and similar news media outlets as a \"conspiracy theory.\"\n\n\"Senator Tom Cotton has taken a lot of flak recently for suggesting that we should still consider the Wuhan virology institute as a source for this,\" Chang said. \"He's absolutely right. Until we know more, you have to keep all of the scenarios on the table. Right now, we can't rule anything out.\"\n\nChang then responded to Michael Bloomberg's claim that the Chinese Communist Party enjoys popular consent of its governance from the Chinese people. \"Xi Jinping is not a dictator,\" said Bloomberg in September 2019, adding, \"No government survives without the will of the majority of its people.\"\n\nMichael Bloomberg \"killed a number\" of stories critical of the Chinese government and Chinese officials slated for publication by Bloomberg News, noted Chang.\n\nChang remarked, \"[Michael Bloomberg] has said, in recent times, some very slavish pro-Beijing statements. He's got to be called to account for that, and I think those statements make him unfit to be president, because the highest duty of the president is to defend the U.S. against foreign enemies, and we have no greater enemy than China. Calling China as a 'partner' and 'friend,' as Bloomberg does, is just completely inappropriate.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_kraychik@breitbart.com", "name": "Robert Kraychik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Huawei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coming_Collapse_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Coming Collapse of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bastet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_G._Chang", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gordon G.

neurologist and director of Wuchang Hospital in the troubled city of Wuhan, China, was reportedly killed by the coronavirus on Tuesday.\n\nLiu is the highest-ranking Chinese medical official to be killed by the virus so far. At least six other health care workers have died from the disease and over 1,700 have taken ill.\n\nLiu was 51 years old and in good health, so he joins the late whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang as evidence the coronavirus does not kill only the elderly and those with severe pre-existing conditions. Li Wenliang was only 34 years old when the virus killed him two weeks ago.\n\nAs with Dr. Li, the Chinese Communist Party scrambled to control the political fallout from Dr. Liu's death, delaying public acknowledgment, leading to what the Epoch Times described as \"confusion\" about Liu's condition:\n\nThe director and party secretary of the publicity center within the Health Commission of Hubei first reported that Liu had died around 10:00 p.m. local time on Feb. 17 through Weibo, a popular Twitter-like Chinese social media platform.\n\nIn the post, which was subsequently deleted, he described Liu as the first hospital director to have \"sacrificed\" his life to fight the virus and expressed \"profound condolences.\"\n\n[...]\n\nConfusion arose just hours after the party secretary's Weibo post after Liu's wife reportedly told Pear Video, a leading Chinese short video platform, that he was in critical condition and was relying on an ECMO machine (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) to support his breathing. She added that his illness had lingered for over 20 days. Liu was transferred to Wuhan Tongji Hospital on Feb. 14 and has been under intubation since, she said.\n\nThe voice in the video was electronically altered. The Epoch Times is unable to independently verify the video's authenticity. A staff member from the hospital confirmed that \"he was being treated,\" but did not provide more information. Another hospital employee said they were not aware of the issue beyond the online discussions.\n\nChina Daily and several other state run media had also run reports on Liu death, but subsequently deleted their articles and social media posts, in a fashion reminiscent of the death of Wuhan doctor and whistleblower Li Wenliang less than two weeks ago.\n\nOnce this \"confusion\" was resolved, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced that Liu \"passed away at 10:54 Tuesday morning at the age of 51 after all-out efforts to save him failed.\"\n\n\"From the start of the outbreak, Comrade Liu Zhiming, without regard to his personal safety, led the medical staff of Wuchang Hospital at the front lines of the fight against the epidemic,\" the commission said, crediting Liu with making \"significant contributions\" to Wuhan's fight against the disease.\n\nWuchang Hospital is one of seven major facilities designated for the treatment of coronavirus patients in Wuhan. Dr. Liu was a leading neurologist at the hospital.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name": "John

coronavirus outbreak may be taking a heavier toll than expected on businesses in the United States, according to a survey released Friday.\n\nPrivate sector firms across the U.S. signaled \"a slight decline in business activity in February,\" IHS Markit said.\n\nThe IHS Markit Flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index dropped to 49.6 in February. That is down from 53.3 in January and below the consensus forecast.\n\nIHS said that overall contraction was driven by a the first fall in service sector output in four years.\n\n\"With the exception of the government-shutdown of 2013, US business activity contracted for the first time since the global financial crisis in February. Weakness was primarily seen in the service sector, where the first drop in activity for four years was reported, but manufacturing production also ground almost to a halt due to a near-stalling of orders,\" Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, said.\n\nThe culprits for the February slump: coronavirus and politics.\n\n\"Total new orders fell for the first time in over a decade. The deterioration in was in part linked to the coronavirus outbreak, manifesting itself in weakened demand across sectors such as travel and tourism, as well as via falling exports and supply chain disruptions,\" Williamson said. \"However, companies also reported increased caution in respect to spending due to worries about a wider economic slowdown and uncertainty ahead of the presidential election later this year.\"\n\nThe IHS Markit report stands in stark contrast to the surveys of manufacturing businesses released this week by the Philadelphia and New York Federal Reserve banks. Those showed a stronger-than-expected uptick in growth in their regions. All three reports are based on surveys of business executives.\n\nOne silver lining in the IHS report is that businesses not only remain optimistic but are becoming more so.\n\nThe survey data are consistent with GDP growth slowing from just above 2% in January to a crawl of just 0.6% in February. However, the February survey also saw a notable upturn in business sentiment about the year ahead, reflecting widespread optimism that the current slowdown will prove shortlived.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_carney@breitbart.com", "name": "John Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHS_Markit", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IHS Markit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Williamson_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Williamson (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weakness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Flash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Project Management Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007\u20132008", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Brokerages", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/GettyImages-1197571071-e1580418796843.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5536990", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 146, "pinterest": 3}, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1454141113", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-20", "time": "00:15:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-20T00:15:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-19T22:25:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/19/report-china-deploys-hundreds-internet-censors-shut-down-coronavirus-talk/", "title": "Report: China Deploys Hundreds of Internet Censors for Coronavirus Talk", "body": "The Epoch Times on Tuesday reported that China has \"engaged over 1,600 censors to scrub the internet of 'sensitive' information relating to the coronavirus outbreak.\"\n\nThe information control effort apparently accelerated after Chinese communist leader Xi Jinping emerged from relative seclusion and asserted himself as being in control of the coronavirus response.\n\nThe Epoch Times claimed to obtain an internal report drafted on February 15 by officials in Hubei province, epicenter of the virus outbreak. These officials were alarmed by criticism of the government and persistent speculation that the number of people sickened and killed by the virus was much higher than the government was willing to admit.\n\nChina's infamous \"50 Cent Army\" of online trolls was accordingly deployed to wipe out troublesome social media posts and divert the Chinese public's attention to inspiring stories about government officials and those fighting on the front lines against the coronavirus:\n\nThe trolls, through technological and manual screening, had identified as many as 606,800 posts online with \"sensitive or harmful information,\" it said.\n\nTheir approach, it said, was to \"timely dispel the online rumors\" and \"strike powerful blows offline.\"\n\nAs of Feb. 14, the online censors had deleted as many as 54,000 such \"rumors,\" and had social media influencers write nearly 400 commentary articles to shape the narrative.\n\nThe regime's propaganda efforts, the report said, should be directed toward promoting the effects of officials' outbreak control measures and the \"moving deeds\" of volunteers, community workers, and the police.\n\nSome professional \"internet commentators\" had also made 400,000 comments to \"counter the negative public opinions,\" according to the document.\n\nThe censors were particularly effective at erasing public expressions of anger over the death of Dr. Li Wenliang, the whistleblower who was himself persecuted for \"spreading rumors\" when he warned about the danger posed by the coronavirus in the early days of the outbreak, long before the government was willing to admit those dangers. Grief and anger over Li's death from the virus was erased almost as quickly as it could be posted online, replaced by government-approved celebrations of Li as a hero and martyr of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSecuring a monopoly on coronavirus information required chasing foreign media out of Hubei, a project viewed as highly successful in the report. As of this week, only five media organizations from beyond China still had reporters on the ground in Hubei.\n\nChinese citizens, meanwhile, have been terrorized into silence with threats of prosecution for \"spreading rumors\" or \"spreading fake information,\" nebulously-defined crimes that can carry sentences of up to seven years in prison. Hundreds of arrests have been made for \"spreading rumors\" according to human rights groups, many of them involving online posts that were demonstrably accurate.\n\nThe document viewed by the Epoch Times allegedly specified that Hubei propaganda groups are working closely with the central government in Beijing to \"coordinate public opinion,\" both \"inside the country and overseas.\"\n\nInformation control is particularly important now that the regime in Beijing is attempting to portray the coronavirus epidemic as completely under control and likely to end within a few weeks, and the official new Party narrative is that Xi and other top officials responded quickly to the threat but were frustrated by poor compliance with their orders from inept Hubei officials.\n\nThe death toll is now over 2,000, but Chinese officials claimed the rate of new infections began slowing this week, eager to persuade the rest of the world to begin lifting travel bans that have inflicted tremendous costs on the Chinese economy.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), which has been very careful to avoid antagonizing China, sounded a rare note of disagreement and said the optimistic Chinese reports \"must be interpreted very cautiously.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Chinese government expelled three journalists from the Wall Street Journal over an op-ed piece published by the paper - but not written by any of the three journalists - that Beijing considered \"racist.\"\n\nThe article in question, written by foreign affairs and humanities professor Walter Russell Mead of Bard College, referred to China as the \"real sick man of Asia\" - a phrase coined by Russia's Tsar Nicholas I to describe the fading Ottoman Empire as the \"sick man of Europe\" in the 19th Century. The phrase has been used by numerous authors and historians to describe other troubled powers around the world since then.\n\nThe thesis of the article that so enraged Beijing was that local officials responded to the virus in a \"secretive and self-serving\" manner, shaking confidence in the Chinese Communist Party \"at home and abroad\" badly enough to threaten the Chinese economy.", "source":

Probably Chinese. Should I call [the police]?\" one driver messaged his peers. \"How do I figure out if they're Chinese? Should I ask them?\" a colleague wondered.\n\nThe befuddlement reflected in screenshots of the group exchanges seen by The Associated Press had a common source -- instructions from Moscow's public transit operator Wednesday for drivers to call a dispatcher if Chinese nationals boarded their buses, Russian media reported.\n\nA leaked email that the media reports said was sent by the state-owned transportation company Mosgortrans told dispatchers who took such calls to notify the police. The email, which the company immediately described on Twitter as fake, carried a one-word subject line: coronavirus.\n\nSince the outbreak of the new virus that has infected more than 76,000 people and killed more than 2,300 in mainland China, Russia has reported two cases. Both patients, Chinese nationals hospitalized in Siberia, recovered quickly. Russian authorities nevertheless are going to significant -- some argue discriminatory -- lengths to keep the virus from resurfacing and spreading.\n\nMoscow officials ordered police raids of hotels, dormitories, apartment buildings, and businesses to track down the shrinking number of Chinese people remaining in the city. They also authorized the use of facial recognition technology to find those suspected of evading a 14-day self-quarantine period upon their arrival in Russia.\n\n\"Conducting raids is an unpleasant task, but it is necessary, for the potential carriers of the virus as well,\" Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in a statement outlining various methods to find and track Chinese people the city approved as a virus prevention strategy.\n\nThe effort to identify Chinese citizens on public transportation applies not only to buses, but underground trains and street trams in Moscow, Russian media reported Wednesday.\n\nMetro workers were instructed to stop riders from China and ask them to fill out questionnaires asking why they were in Russia and whether they observed the two-week quarantine, the reports said. The forms also ask respondents for their health condition and the address of where they are were staying.\n\nIn Yekaterinburg, a city located 1,790 kilometres (1,112 miles) away from Moscow in the Urals Mountains, members of the local Chinese community also are under watch. Self-styled Cossack patrols in the city hand out medical masks along with strong recommendations to visit a health clinic to Chinese residents.\n\nHuman rights advocates have condemned the targeting of Chinese nationals as racial profiling, not an effective epidemic control strategy.\n\n\"Prevention of any serious virus, be it a flu or the new coronavirus, should involve a proper information campaign and not discrimination of other people,\" said Alyona Popova, an activist engaged in a year-long court challenge of Moscow's use of facial recognition technology.\n\nThe containment measures in the capital came as the Russian government instituted an indefinite ban on Chinese nationals entering the country that could block up to 90% of travelers coming to Russia from China. Weeks before, Russia shut down the country's long land border with China, suspended all trains and most flights between the two countries.\n\nThe Moscow Metro confirmed to The Associated Press that the underground system was \"actively monitoring the stations\" and has a protocol in place for dealing with people who \"have recently returned from the People\u00b4s Republic of China.\"\n\n\"We ask to see their documents and to show us documents [proving] that if they have recently returned from the People's Republic of China, they have undergone a two-week quarantine period,\" Yulia Temnikova, Moscow Metro\u00b4s deputy chief of client and passenger services, said.\n\nIf an individual does not show proof of completing the quarantine, Metro workers ask the person to fill out the form and call an ambulance, Temnikova said.\n\nBus and tram drivers contacted their labour union about the instructions to look for Chinese nationals and report them to the dispatch centre. The drivers were outraged and didn't know what to do, Public Transport Workers Union chairman Yuri Dashkov said.\n\n\"So he saw a Chinese national, and then what?\" Dashkov said. \"How can he ascertain that he saw a Chinese national, or a Vietnamese national, or a Japanese, or [someone from the Russian region of] Yakutia?\"\n\nDashkov showed the AP a photo of the email that officials at Mosgortrans were said to have sent out. He also showed three photos of on-bus electronic displays reading, \"If Chinese nationals are discovered in the carriage, inform the dispatcher.\"\n\nThe AP was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the email and the photos. Dashkov shared screenshots of what appeared to be a genuine bus drivers' group chat in WhatsApp.\n\nWhile Moscow public transit operator Mosgortrans dismissed the email as phoney on its official Twitter account Wednesday, the company told the AP in a statement two days later that it does \"conduct monitoring\" and \"sends data to the medics when necessary.\"\n\nMosgortrans referred additional questions to the detailed statement from Moscow's mayor, who on Friday acknowledged the sharp focus on Chinese people in the city's virus-control plan.\n\nOfficials ordered everyone arriving from China to isolate themselves for two weeks, and those who skip the quarantine step will be identified through video surveillance and facial recognition technology, Sobyanin said. The systems give authorities the ability to \"constantly control compliance with the protocol,\" he said in the statement.\n\nThe mayor\u00b4s office did not respond to a request for comment on the city's containment approach and the accusation that it's discriminatory. But rights activist Popova insists the facial recognition program is unlawful whether the searches are seeking Russian or Chinese faces.\n\n\"We have a constitutional right to privacy, and citizens of [other countries] have it according to foreign and international legal norms,\" she said.\n\nTemnikova from the Moscow Metro rejected accusations of racial profiling. Subway workers \"mainly look at the passenger's [health] condition,\" she said, and approach \"people who need help.\"\n\nAddressing identification questions like the ones that worried the bus drivers, Temnikova said it should be \"clear who could have arrived from China\" because \"it is obvious.\"\n\nThe Cossacks of Yekaterinburg -- men in conservative, often pro-Kremlin groups claiming to be successors of the proud guards who policed the Russian Empire's frontiers - took fighting the virus into their own hands three weeks ago. They also have a system of sorts for deciding who needs a face mask and advice to see a medical professional.\n\n\"Mainly [we approach] people from China because it is from them that the coronavirus came. They are the main source,\" Igor Gorbunov, elder of the Ural Volunteer Cossack Corps, told the AP during one such patrol Friday.\n\n\"But not only them,\" Gorbunov continued. \"There are different nationalities, there are many people of Asian appearance, and they seem to be vulnerable to this disease, the coronavirus, because it is them who are most often affected. Europeans are not yet affected much.\"\n\n___\n\nTanya Titova and Harriet Morris contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":

Elmhurst branch of the Queens Public Library in New York City announced on Friday that it would take down a Chinese government exhibit falsely depicting children in Tibet as happily learning the Tibetan language and living freely - a far cry from the repressive reality Beijing has imposed on the region.\n\nNew York's local government only took down the exhibit after more than a week of protests from the local Tibetan community, which includes many former political prisoners under communism and refugees who endured the full brunt of Beijing's human rights abuses. The Tibetans say that the exhibit did not appear to be advertised, but, as members of the community, they were broadsided by images promoted by the U.S. government hiding the suffering of their relatives back home.\n\nWhile the exhibit is set to be taken down this weekend, many questions surrounding the incident remain unanswered. Mayor Bill de Blasio, when confronted on Wednesday by a member of the Tibetan community concerned about Chinese infiltration of American institutions, said he had no idea the exhibit was there. New York City has not yet made public who approved the exhibit or how it came to be. Had Tibetan Americans not encountered it on routine visits to their local library, it might still be there.\n\n\"We are residents of Queens and the neighborhood around the Queens Library,\" Ngawang Tashi, the vice president of the U.S. Tibet Committee, told Breitbart News on Friday. \"So we are used to going there for studying and reading books, etc. Last week, one of our neighbors went there and noticed pictures hanging on the glass walls stating that Tibet is happy and [Tibetans] have the right to learn their languages and all the development China has given Tibet. ... Activists from Students for a Free Tibet visited and realized this was Chinese propaganda\":\n\nMost offensive to the Tibetans was an image of three children holding up scrolls in the Tibetan language, clearly appearing to be learning it. China banned children from learning Tibetan last year and has imposed Mandarin, the language of the Han ethnic majority in the country. Tibetans in the region have self-immolated to protest the erasure of their language.\n\n\"The main focus of the exhibition is to show ... that Tibetans in Tibet are happily enjoying religious, cultural, and language rights under [the] well-developed CCP [Chinese Communist Party] government,\" Tashi explained. \"They exhibited pictures of kids enjoying writing Tibetan scripts, people dancing, and the introduction says that different Tibetan communities are enjoying their religious rights, human rights, and so on.\"\n\nTashi told Breitbart News the exhibit also claimed that parts of India and Nepal were Chinese sovereign territory.\n\nThe New York Tibetan community began protesting the exhibit almost immediately after discovering it, organizing a rally outside of the library two weeks ago. In response, the Chinese consulate in New York insisted that Tibet was part of a sovereign Tibet and happily so. In response to a request for comment from the local outlet Gothamist, the Chinese consulate refused to call Tibet \"Tibet,\" instead using the Mandarin term \"Xizang.\"\n\n\"Xizang has been part of China since ancient times. Xizang affairs are purely China's internal affairs that allow no foreign interference. During the past 60 years or so, Xizang has seen historical progress in economic, social, cultural, ecological and other areas,\" the statement read in part, continuing:\n\nToday, it enjoys sound economic growth, social stability, ethnic solidarity, religious harmony, cultural vitality, well-preserved ecological environment and improving living-standards. People of all ethnic groups in the Xizang Autonomous Region endorse wholeheartedly the policies of China's central government and the regional government.\n\nLast week, Students for a Free Tibet revealed that library officials had rejected their request to take the exhibit down.\n\n\"There are so many young Tibetans who go to this library and now they have to see an exhibition that shows that everything is fine in Tibet, when in reality they know about the plight of their families in Tibet,\" Pema Doma, campaigns director at Students for a Free Tibet, said in a statement after the Queens Public Library rejected their petition. \"Imagine if a library had an exhibit which showed white Americans in blackface. This is how we Tibetans feel when we see photos on display of Chinese people proudly appropriating Tibetan dress.\"\n\nThe Tibetans organized more protests in response and took their grievances directly to Mayor Bill de Blasio. While de Blasio identifies as a far-leftist and has supported communist regimes in the past, he appeared offended at the idea of communist propaganda appearing at a New York library and vowed to remove it.\n\n\"You've got my full attention,\" de Blasio told a Tibetan community member at a town hall on Wednesday. \"I did not hear that one before. I am exceedingly critical of the Chinese government, the way they have oppressed people and taken away their human rights. No one has suffered more than the Tibetan people. So I did not have any reason to believe that any of our library systems would present the Chinese government point of view.\"\n\n\"I would have assumed the other way around, honestly, and I'd be getting the complaint from the Chinese government,\" de Blasio said, adding that he would immediately address the issue with relevant officials:\n\nTwo days later, the Queens Public Library system announced it would remove the exhibit.\n\n\"[T]he Chinese Consulate and its affiliate made the decision to discontinue the exhibit, which will be removed by tomorrow morning,\" the Queens Library said in a statement on Friday. \"We thank the Tibetan community for their ongoing conversations with us, and we look forward to future collaboration with them.\"\n\nTashi told Breitbart News this was the first exhibit of his kind that his group was aware of, in which Chinese government officials peddled communist propaganda in local public institutions in America. China has more publicly focused on academic institutions, founding \"Confucius institutes\" that pressure American academics not to deviate from China's false territorial claims on places like Tibet, Taiwan, and international waters in the South China Sea. Chinese officials also regularly pressure American politicians and academics not to speak up about human rights abuses against ethnic minorities like Tibetans and Uyghurs and not to support protesters in Hong Kong. They also threaten Hollywood movie studios not to tell stories that question the greatness of the Communist Party if they wish to maintain access to the lucrative Chinese theater market.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has branded China a strategic competitor and empowered his State Department to combat Communist Party lies on the dire state of human rights in the country, particularly against ethnic minorities. Chinese officials appear to have recalibrated their propaganda tactics in response, cutting deals with local governments and pressuring them to promote the Party's interests while Washington is not looking.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo warned local governments that China had expanded pressure on them to promote Beijing's interests:\n\nBut sometimes China's activities aren't quite that public, and I want to talk about some of that today. Let me read you an excerpt of a letter from a Chinese diplomat. It was China's Consul General in New York sent a letter last month to the speaker of one of your state legislatures.\n\nHere's what the letter said in part. It said, quote, \"As we all know, Taiwan is part of China ... avoid engaging in any official contact with Taiwan, including sending congratulatory messages to the electeds, introducing bills and proclamations for the election, sending officials and representatives to attend the inauguration ceremony, and inviting officials in Taiwan to visit the United States.\" End of quote from the letter.\n\nThink about that. You had a diplomat from China assigned here to the United States, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party in New York City, sending an official letter urging that an American elected official shouldn't exercise his right to freedom of speech.\n\nLet that sink in for just a minute.\n\nAnd this isn't a one-off event. It's happening all across the country.\n\nChinese consulates in New York, in Illinois, in Texas, and two in California, bound by the diplomatic responsibilities and rights of the Vienna Convention, are very politically active at the state level, as is the embassy right here in Washington, D.C.\n\nMaybe some of you have heard about the time when the Chinese consulate paid the UC-San Diego students to protest the Dalai Lama.\n\nOr last August, when former governor Phil Bryant of Mississippi received a letter from a diplomat in the consul's office in Houston, threatening to cancel a Chinese investment if the governor chose to travel to Taiwan. Phil went anyway.\n\nLast year, a high school - a high school, a high school in Chicago - disinvited a Taiwanese representative to serve on a climate panel after Chinese pressure.\n\nIt's one thing to pressure the Secretary of State of the United States of America. It seems quite something else to go after a high school principal. It shows depth. It shows systemization. It shows intent.\n\nChinese Communist Party officials, too, are cultivating relationships with county school board members and local politicians - often through what are known as sister cities programs.\n\nAcross the Hudson River from New York, China's relationships with local school board members prompted a bitter fight between Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop and his Board of Education in January. Fulop moved to attempt to make school board seats appointed positions, rather than elected ones so that he could remove individuals he considered an \"embarrassment\" to the city:\n\nThe \"member overseas\" is Board Trustee Mussab Ali, currently in China studying under Tsinghua University's Schwarzman Scholars program. Tsinghua is dictator Xi Jinping's alma mater. From China last month, Ali complained that Fulop's attempt to make positions appointed rather than elected was \"nothing short of political greed.\"\n\nIn February, Matt Schapiro, a former Jersey City Board of Education trustee, filed a complaint against Ali with the state's Department of Education, protesting that \"there has been a lawless environment among the Jersey City Board of Education\" and it is impossible for Ali to serve Jersey City students while spending a year in China.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has banned children from learning Tibetan, forcing them to learn Mandarin instead, and banned those under 18 from engaging in religious activities. This keeps Tibetans from passing down their Buddhist beliefs, as it also represses Uyghur Muslims, Falun Gong practitioners, and the ever-growing numbers of Chinese Christians. Beijing regularly detains Tibetans for insufficient loyalty to Beijing and has branded the Tibetan Buddhist religious leader, the Dalai Lama, a terrorist and \"Islamic State sympathizer.\"\n\nChina has also reportedly begun using the ongoing coronavirus outbreak to persecute Tibetans speaking freely, claiming it necessary to prevent the spread of \"misinformation\" and \"rumors.\" Among the banned activity local activists have documented have been prayers for those suffering from the virus.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":

"Two 80+ Passengers Die of Coronavirus on Stranded Cruise Ship", "body": "The government of Japan confirmed on Thursday that two people infected with the Chinese coronavirus died onboard the Diamond Princess, a quarantined cruise ship in which over 600 people have tested positive for the virus.\n\nJapan's Asahi Shimbun reports the two patients were a man and woman in their 80s, both of whom had been relocated out of the ship to a medical facility after falling ill. The newly discovered coronavirus, which has infected upwards of 70,000 people since mid-December, causes respiratory failure and symptoms like fever, body aches, and difficulty breathing. Of those onboard the cruise ship, 29 are reportedly in serious condition.\n\nHealth officials confirmed that the male patient was a coronavirus carrier on February 12, a little over a week before he died. The couple are the first two passengers on the cruise ship to die.\n\nThe cruise ship had been traveling around east Asia when authorities in Hong Kong confirmed that a man who had disembarked in Hong Kong was a coronavirus carrier, according to Japan's Mainichi Shimbun. At the time, on February 2, Japan responded by docking the ship but isolating all those on board. Yokohama was the Diamond Princess's initial point of departure.\n\nJapan docked the cruise ship at the port of Yokohama and has forbidden passengers from leaving, transferring confirmed coronavirus patients to hospitals and monitoring the others for potential infection. The ship was carrying over 3,000 people when the government instituted the isolation measure, which it insists has kept the virus from spreading within Japan itself.\n\nJapan has currently documented over 90 cases nationwide and one death, also a woman in her 80s, not counting the 621 cases on the Diamond Princess. Japanese officials reportedly insisted that the World Health Organization (WHO) not count the Diamond Princess cases as cases within Japan, as it gives the impression that the virus is spreading more rapidly on the island nation than the numbers for just Japan would indicate.\n\nThe cruise ship has confirmed more coronavirus cases on its own than any other country in the world except for China, which has confirmed 74,579 cases at press time.\n\nIn addition to the two deaths, Japan also confirmed seven new coronavirus cases on Thursday outside of the ship. One of the individuals was identified as having received care at a hospital where the woman who died of coronavirus in Japan had also been, suggesting potential issues with protective measures in health facilities nationwide. Adding to the concern was the nature of the new cases on the cruise ship, as well, including government officials who were helping manage to isolate the ship and fell ill.\n\nThe rapidly increasing number of cases on the ship has led to sharp criticism of both the government and the cruise line responsible for the ship. Speaking to Asahi, an unnamed man trapped on the ship complained that it took days for the ship's crew to begin wearing protective gear like gloves and face masks.\n\n\"I got the impression that the passengers and the crew did not take seriously the risks of infection for a while after the ship's arrival at Yokohama,\" he told the newspaper. \"I am afraid that precautions against the infection were not thorough in some respects.\"\n\nCiting eyewitness accounts, Asahi described a chaotic situation for the crew on the ship.\n\n\"Some of the employees could not stop coughing, and other crew members had to be taken to hospitals by ambulance. Crew members share cabins and eat together in a dining hall,\" the newspaper detailed.\n\nThe man added that those with symptoms had to wait on long lines to see medical staff, as there were not enough doctors and other medical professionals to care for the hundreds who fell ill. This caused a delay in treatment that likely exacerbated the spread of the virus, he posited.\n\nHe also noted that there was no indication of officials separating individuals carrying the virus from those still feeling healthy or shutting down parts of the ship where infected people may have been. The virus is believed to spread through aerosol droplets in the air, making it highly contagious.\n\nMainichi relayed the concerns within the government that handling of the cruise ship outbreak will hurt popular sentiment towards Prime Minister Abe Shinzo's administration.\n\n\"Just the return of 100-odd people per chartered flight [from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak] created chaos. There's no facility that can accommodate 30 times as many people,\" an unnamed Abe official told the newspaper.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, central China, and is believed to have been triggered by the consumption of wild game at a meat market in the city. After China alerted the world to the existence of a new, highly contagious virus - 20 days after officially shutting down the market and privately informing WHO officials - many of the world's nations began evacuating citizens from the region. Japan, the official in the Mainichi article contended, was too occupied trying to save its citizens in Wuhan and overextended itself, leaving the Diamond Princess situation understaffed.\n\nEven while admitting this, anonymous officials speaking to the newspaper appeared frustrated over the criticism.\n\n\"Could other countries have dealt with the situation any better?\" one exasperated \"senior prime minister's office figure\" reportedly said.\n\nJapan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) published a study this week rating Abe's response to the outbreak positively, finding that preventing Diamond Princess passengers from landing in Japan likely prevented infections.\n\n\"The decline in the number of confirmed cases, based on reported onset dates, implies that the quarantine intervention was effective in reducing transmission among passengers,\" the report said.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

States did a worse job of controlling the H1N1 virus in 2009:\n\nThe US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 60.8 million Americans contracted the H1N1 virus. From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, the virus led to more than 12,000 deaths in a population of 300 million, a number that is hardly on par with the medical standards of a developed nation.\n\nAdditionally, CDC estimates that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from the H1N1 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.\n\nWell, at least they declared it a public health emergency. However, the US government clearly failed to take enough measures to control it.\n\nThis was followed by the Communist Party's familiar lament that ordinary influenza outbreaks supposedly infect and kill more people than the Wuhan coronavirus, but no one makes a big deal about the flu, plus some carping about the disaster response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nThe People's Daily wrapped up by quoting the same politically useful statements from the World Health Organization (WHO) that Chinese propaganda repeats on a daily basis:\n\nJust like WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said in his speech: \"There is a window of opportunity because of the strong measures China is taking at the epicenter, at the source.\"\n\nFacts and numbers have clearly displayed the truth: China's speed, scale, and efficiency all demonstrate the strengths of its system.\n\nUS politicians should stop pointing figures at others, especially if the US government is unable to act in times of public emergency. At the very least, they can shut their mouths if they cannot provide actual help to the world.\n\nAnother People's Daily article lamented that the U.S. is not doling out foreign aid quickly enough:\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced recently on social media that Washington would offer up to $100 million to China and other countries affected by the coronavirus to combat its spread, saying \"This commitment demonstrates strong U.S. leadership in response to the outbreak.\"\n\nHowever, when asked about the implementation of the fund at a news conference held on Feb.10 in Washington, James Richardson, director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources at the State Department, said the $100 million was just an upper limit.\n\nExcept for some assigned projects to help Laos, he didn't disclose further details about the fund.\n\nAny constructive international cooperation shall be welcomed in this global public health challenge, including the assistance promised by the U.S. for Southeast Asian countries such as Laos.\n\nHowever, people would question that the implementation of the assistance obviously doesn't match what Washington has promised. What's more, the delayed aid is also not convincing enough to back the \"strong leadership\" claimed by the U.S. government.\n\nBut then another state-run Chinese publication, the Global Times, accused the U.S. of racism for insinuating that China needs any help at all, tossing in the same H1Z1 figures quoted by the People's Daily to argue that America has no standing to criticize China's handling of the coronavirus:\n\nThis double standard not only reflects the US stance toward China's efforts in combating the outbreak, but in other domains as well. This is partly related to so-called American exceptionalism, which presumes that US values, political system, and history are worthy of universal admiration. It indicates that the US is both destined and entitled to play a distinct role at the world stage. This provides the US with a pretext to promote its global hegemony, set double standards and meddle in internal affairs of other countries.\n\nWhen dealing with countries like China, whose ideology and political system are totally different from those in the West, the double standards imposed by the US tend to be more severe.\n\nAs the world's only superpower, Washington is supposed to shoulder more responsibility during a global health emergency. It should be providing more health-care material aid and proactively leading or organizing international cooperation. At the very least, the US should maintain neutrality toward the outbreak and show sympathy toward the people suffering from the epidemic, rather than add insult to injury.\n\nThe Global Times theorized that U.S. \"prejudice\" could be why it challenges the accuracy of coronavirus information released by China, speculated that offers of assistance could be a pretext for American troops to conduct \"military missions to detect China's capabilities in biochemical research,\" muttered about links between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the military, and concluded by wondering if Washington isn't delivering all the help it was racist to offer because of President Trump's selfish and xenophobic \"America First\" policy.\n\nThe dangerous thing about all this political spin is that it goes beyond the Chinese Communist Party nursing its wounded pride. The Chinese are desperate to get normal travel and commerce flowing again, no matter the risks posed to foreign populations by the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\nInternational organizations are reluctant to provoke Beijing's ire by openly accusing it of providing false information about the number of infections and deaths. China is trying to leverage that reluctance and force the rest of the world to embrace its political narratives about the epidemic, but the cold, hard truth is that most of the world knows it would be much safer to wait for independent confirmation that the epidemic really is receding.\n\nAt the moment, roughly ten percent of the immense Chinese population is living under some form of quarantine or lockdown. Reports of high-profile deaths continue to accumulate even as Chinese officials insist the situation is under control, and the deaths include a disturbing number of healthy young victims, not the ailing old people that are supposed to be most at risk.\n\nThe latest tragedy is a report on Tuesday that Chinese film director Chang Kai and his entire family in the city of Wuhan were wiped out by the coronavirus. Chang was 55 years old. He lived long enough to see his father and mother die, and write a letter to his friends that said, \"Farewell to those I love, and to those who loved me.\"\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party can hurl all the insults it wants, but the world has good reason to doubt that the full story of the Wuhan coronavirus has been told, and good reason to believe the continued good health of foreigners is not at the top of the Party's list of priorities.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name": "John Hayward",

Devastation", "body": "Eastern Africa is facing a food crisis after a devastating plague of desert locusts, the worst seen in the region for several generations.\n\nA new wave of insects is already spreading across half a dozen African nations and poised to consume new crops that were planted to replace last season's losses. Political instability in the region is adding to the misery as violent insurgencies make it difficult to distribute both locally grown and internationally donated food.\n\nAs Germany's Deutsche Welle (DW) noted in a grim report on Wednesday, food shortages threaten to trigger even more violence as battle lines are drawn over livestock and grazing lands.\n\n\"There is nothing left to harvest. And there is nothing else that I know how to do. It's just this farm. That's where I get food, where I feed my family and friends, all people,\" a Kenyan farmer told DW.\n\nSome of the worst locust rampages are occurring in places like Somalia where the ground is soaked in blood from the atrocities of the al-Shabaab terrorist gang, and South Sudan, where a fragile peace coalition could collapse and rekindle a brutal civil war. Drought and political violence combined to unleash famine in South Sudan even before the locusts arrived.\n\nThe locusts are a formidable adversary, with swarms capable of traveling over a hundred miles a day and devouring as many crops as thousands of humans. Swarms larger than entire cities have been observed in Africa.\n\nAs the locust plague spreads beyond Africa, some are trying to turn the tables by eating the locusts. \"Its taste is delicious. If you eat one locust, you will end up wanting to eat five. I walk every day after breakfast to find locusts for dinner. I have become addicted,\" a Yemeni told the Jerusalem Post.\n\nPoliticians like U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres were quick to link the locust plague to \"climate change,\" although Deutsche Welle quoted scientists who more cautiously explained the extraordinary number of locusts are a result of climate variations, with swarms of equal and larger size reported long before the beginning of the industrial era:\n\nClimate experts have pointed to unusually heavy rains, aided by a powerful cyclone off Somalia in December, as a major factor in the outbreak. Niklas Hagelberg, senior program coordinator at the UN Environment Programme, told DW that scientific data did not yet directly link the current events with climate change, even if he \"personally\" believes in the possibility. \"What we can say is that the likelihood for increasing rainfall, increasing heat, increasing winds, has gone up due to climate change,\" Hagelberg said. \"So the likelihood for a swarm like this has increased.\"\n\nSpraying with pesticides is an emergency measure. In future, other steps need to be taken to improve the response to similar outbreaks. \"I think a key element from a climate change point of view is that we have early warning systems,\" Hagelberg said. \"Because the system is changing, we need to get early warnings on conditions for the formation of swarms as early as possible, which would make a timely and concerted international reaction possible.\"\n\nCNBC on Thursday noted the severe economic damage from the locust plague, such as the destruction of Ethiopia's vital coffee and tea crops, which make up 30 percent of the country's exports. The shortage of crops is applying inflationary pressure to economies that can ill afford it and making it harder for governments and corporations in eastern Africa to obtain credit. Some analysts believe the region could lose one or two percent of its GDP growth this year.\n\nKenya's economic fate may be decided by exactly where those fast-moving locust swarms decide to go next. As analysts explained to CNBC, the locusts have mostly afflicted northern Kenya, far from where its major export crops are grown, resulting in food insecurity for the local population but relatively little financial damage. If the locusts move further south, the economic forecast will grow considerably more pessimistic, with almost a percentage point of GDP on the line.\n\nU.N. experts worry that the locust population could grow by up to 500 times over the summer and spread to 30 countries. One of those countries is China, which is already dealing with a deadly coronavirus epidemic. Locust swarms have already been sighted along the Chinese border.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com",

Coronavirus", "body": "The Chinese communist regime announced the death of Peng Yinhua, a 29-year-old doctor from Wuhan, on Friday after the health professional contracted the novel coronavirus that has infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide.\n\nPeng had made headlines in Chinese state media for postponing his wedding to stay in Wuhan and treat patients as the outbreak became an overt pandemic in the city, Hubei's regional capital and home to 11 million people. His death is extraordinary as most of the upwards of 2,000 people killed by the Wuhan virus are considered either elderly or patients with other chronic diseases.\n\nHe joins two other doctors that Beijing claims died of coronavirus: 34-year-old Li Wenliang, famous as one of the eight people arrested in January for posting safety information about the virus on social media, and 51-year-old Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan's central hospital.\n\nChinese authorities have not provided an explanation for why these young, otherwise healthy men lost their lives while nearly 19,000 people have recovered safely after being diagnosed.\n\nThe novel coronavirus is believed to have jumped from animals to humans at a wild meat market in Wuhan in December. Chinese authorities shut the market down on January 1, but did not make the outbreak public until January 20, allowing mass assemblies throughout Wuhan that likely exacerbated the spread of the virus. Chinese officials also failed to tell health workers that a contagious respiratory infection had been identified, so early coronavirus patients were not quarantined for a month or longer.\n\nWuhan authorities also said that 5 million people left the city before Beijing made the outbreak public, spreading the virus to every province in the nation and a host of nations in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and North America.\n\nThe coronavirus causes a respiratory infection that triggered fevers, difficulty breathing, pneumonia, and death. Doctors believe that it can spread through viral particles in the air, making it highly contagious.\n\nChinese state propaganda eulogized Peng as a hero for choosing not to leave Wuhan during the Lunar New Year, which occurred just days after China made the outbreak public, or get married as he had planned at the time. Peng had set his wedding date for February 1. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua lamented that he \"never got to send out his wedding invitations, which are still in his office drawer.\" Peng specialized in respiratory illnesses and so saw himself as key to helping Wuhan fight the virus.\n\nChina Daily, another government outlet, specified that he died of pneumonia after testing positive for the new coronavirus.\n\nPeng's is the most high-profile case of a medical death since Liu Zhiming's. Liu was a neurologist and in charge of the Wuchang hospital in Wuhan when he died last week. He is believed to be the highest-ranking medical official the coronavirus has killed in China.\n\nShortly before his death, in early February, authorities revealed that of Li Wenliang. Li had only been identified as one of the victims of Wuhan police censorship shortly before authorities reported his death, then claimed the report was false, only to ultimately confirm it.\n\nPrior to his death, he was one of eight people detained and \"handled,\" according to Chinese officials, by Wuhan police for spreading \"falsehoods\" about the virus online. Li had posted in an all-doctors Weibo group that he believed the virus was highly contagious and medical professionals should take care to isolate patients and use precautionary measures, which the government had yet to tell doctors to do. Police detained Li for hours and forced him to sign a humiliating statement vowing to never again \"disturb the public order\" shortly before he was confirmed to be carrying coronavirus and later died.\n\nChina has not made the medical history of any of the three doctors public, suggesting they did not have any chronic conditions that would have worsened the coronavirus infection. This makes them extremely rare cases of young, healthy people dying from the infection.\n\nLi's death, in particular, prompted widespread anger at the Chinese government, which state media attempted to deflect away from Beijing and towards Wuhan local officials. Growing frustration with widespread city lockdowns and minimal information on how to protect from the virus has resulted in a torrent of criticism of the government online, prompting Beijing to invest in over a thousand censors deployed to Weibo, WeChat, and other government social media to delete posts the government does not approve of.\n\nChina is also attempted to generate goodwill from its frustrated people through the alleged construction of nearly two dozen hospitals in Wuhan. Chinese media repeatedly spread propaganda around the construction of one \"hospital\" in Wuhan in barely a week, but has not allowed international media to observe it. On Friday, Wuhan authorities said they would build another 19 medical facilities.\n\n\"Upon their completion, all the makeshift hospitals in Wuhan are expected to offer 30,000 beds on Feb. 25, said Hu Yabo, deputy mayor of Wuhan at a press briefing on epidemic prevention and control,\" according to the state-run Global Times newspaper.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news",

Johnson \"loves China\" and is on board with its imperialist Belt and Road initiative, according to extensive details about a phone call between him and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping released by a Chinese-government controlled news outlet.\n\nThe British prime minister spoke to Xi Jinping by telephone on Tuesday morning, discussing the Coronavirus outbreak and trade. While the tone of the official account of the call from Boris Johnson's office gives little away, reports from Beijing emphasised Mr Johnson's support for Xi and the Belt and Road economic project, a global push by China to distinctly tip the geopolitical landscape in their own favour.\n\nDowning Street confirmed the call had taken place on Wednesday morning, in a vague readout that gave significantly less detail on the conversation and made no mention of the controversial Belt and Road initiative. While the prime minister's office stated he \"offered his sympathies for those affected by the outbreak of coronavirus in China\", a report by the Communist Party-controlled Global Times reports Mr Johnson expressed \"on behalf of the British government and people... admiration\" of the Chinese government's response to the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAccording to the Global Times, the British leader particularly praised China's \"speed and efficiency\" in dealing with Coronavirus, despite claims by global health experts criticising the regime for reacting too slowly to the outbreak, and its insular and secretive instincts hampering a faster global response.\n\nWhile the remarks on Coronavirus may be contested as compliment inflation meant to boost the damaged domestic public standing of Chairman Xi over the Coronavirus epidemic, or even a mistranslation, Boris Johnson's alleged comments on economic integration with China through the One Belt One Road initiative may trigger more concern.\n\nThe South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong-based newspaper owned by Jack Ma, the richest man in China and a member of the Chinese Communist Party, reports Mr Johnson said: \"Britain welcomes investment from Chinese companies... We would like to strengthen our cooperation with China under the Belt and Road Initiative.\"\n\nBreitbart London approached the prime minister's office for further details about Wednesday's call and the prime minister's alleged comments about Belt and Road, but was told by a Downing Street press officer that no comment would be made.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative is an enormous Chinese government project to establish the nation not only as the preeminent manufacturing centre of the world, but one that also controls the means and norms of transport and trade through the 21st century. To this end, the Chinese government is pushing construction -- undertaken by Chinese firms -- of railways, roads, and ports across Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nWhile these projects give China instant influence in the regions they are built in, often they are paid for with massive loans from Beijing which create debt traps -- allowing the Chinese government either an opportunity to repossess critical national infrastructure in foreign nations, or giving Beijing massive influence over foreign governments as a major creditor. In one case, Kenya offered China parts of the Port of Mombassa as collateral on a loan for a $3 billion railway project which it later found it could not afford to repay.\n\nSri Lanka handed over the whole seaport of Hambantota to China in 2017 when it defaulted on a loan repayment. Greece -- a European Union member state -- has also seen its port of Piraeus nationalised by the Chinese state. The United States has called China's approach to offering new infrastructure to nations in Africa and Asia \"predatory\".\n\nThe news that Boris Johnson is allegedly ready to get behind Belt and Road comes amid growing controversy over Britain's tilt towards China, and just days after claims in British newspapers emerged that the United Kingdom was in talks with the Chinese state to build the new High Speed 2 railway linking London with the north of England. Already a decade old and \u00a38 billion down without having built a single mile of railway, the project is tens of billions of pounds over budget and years behind schedule.\n\nBeijing has claimed it could build the railway in years, not decades, for less money, and at higher speeds than the present project promises. The British Department for Transport confirmed that \"preliminary discussions\" were underway.\n\nThe Johnson government's approval of China's Huawei technology firm -- reckoned to be an arm of the Chinese state by critics -- against the advice of the nation's closest allies has also had a seismic impact on Anglo-American relations. As reported earlier this week, President Trump is claimed to have \"slammed\" down the telephone receiver in frustration with Prime Minister Boris Johnson while discussing Britain allowing China to participate building its future data network -- potentially opening the UK and its allies to espionage on a massive scale.\n\nWhile the United Kingdom has never officially signed up to the Belt and Road Initiative before, previous prime ministers have shown real enthusiasm to get close to Beijing. Former Conservative leader David Cameron welcomed Xi Jinping to London in 2015, f\u00eating the Chinese leader, and after he left office became the leader of the United Kingdom's Belt and Road investment fund.\n\nXinhuanet, a news network run by the Chinese government reported in 2018 that Mr Cameron said \"the Belt and Road Initiative will bring new opportunities for bilateral cooperation\", and that Chairman Xi had congratulated the former prime minister on his \"foresight\" in developing closer UK-China ties during his time as leader.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com",

"title": "China Bullies Amazon over 'Coronavirus Made in China' T-Shirt", "body": "The Chinese government on Friday tried using its \"sharp power\" to push online retail colossus Amazon into withdrawing a T-shirt that reads \"Coronavirus Made in China\" and apologize for ever allowing the garment to be sold.\n\nChina's state-run Global Times pulled out the same playbook used successfully against foreign airline companies, hotel chains, and retail outlets in the past, claiming the T-shirt inspired a wave of public outrage that threatens to wash the multi-billion-dollar corporation away:\n\nAmazon is receiving public scorn once again for selling offensive items on its retail platform. The US online retail behemoth has angered many Chinese consumers after they discovered t-shirts and coffee mugs featuring the slogan \"Coronavirus made in China\" were being sold on the platform. If Amazon doesn't want to stand against their Chinese consumers, the company should apologize and punish vendors for selling such items.\n\nAlthough the items in question were not being sold by the company but by platform vendors, Amazon still deserves to be criticized. Listing products with offensive coronavirus slogans exposes the platform's lack of vendor supervision.\n\nThe online company should identify its supervision flaws to avoid social and political issues. Chinese netizens called for an Amazon boycott last year after it was discovered that vendors were selling t-shirts featuring slogans like \"Free Hong Kong, Democracy Now\" in support of the violent protests in Hong Kong. It is clear Amazon has yet to learn anything, nor has it bothered to make management improvements.\n\nWith Amazon allowing vendors to sell items on its platform that feature an offensive slogan about the coronavirus, it could serve a blow to the company's reputation for having a laid-back and playful mindset on a virus that has claimed over 2,000 lives in China.\n\nWe would like to believe that Amazon doesn't want to be known as unsympathetic because of its poor supervisory flaws.\n\nAnother famed online store, eBay, began removing coronavirus merchandise last week on the grounds that it violated company policies against items that \"portray, glorify, or attempt to profit from human tragedy or suffering, or that are insensitive to victims of such events.\"\n\nMany of the items banned by eBay were T-shirts that made fun of the epidemic by comparing the coronavirus to Corona beer, mocked the notion of visiting the outbreak city of Wuhan for fun, or treated surviving the disease as a comical achievement on par with beating a videogame.\n\nIn the course of reporting the eBay bans, the UK Daily Mail noted Amazon still allowed the sale of coronavirus merchandise.\n\nFox Business noted in late January that merchandise satirically referring to the Wuhan virus was appearing on Amazon, eBay, and Etsy, including T-shirts like those described above and items like surgical masks with phony designer logos from fashion houses like Gucci. A brisk trade in actual protective gear was also reported, with prices skyrocketing for the most popular item, medical masks.\n\nAustralia's ABC News on Friday found more examples of profiteering, including books filled with dubious information about the coronavirus and products that made highly questionable claims of offering protection.\n\nABC found coronavirus merchandise high on Google Shopping lists, including at least one item that would probably enrage the Chinese government much more than the rather bland T-shirt it wants Amazon to stop selling:\n\nOne seller, who the website says is based in Turkey, will sell you a coronavirus mason jar -- with a decal that says \"#coronavirus\" over an image of a world map wearing a Chinese flag face mask.\n\nAnd instead of five golden stars, the flag shows five yellow viruses.\n\nMerchants defended their wares to ABC by pointing to their free speech rights and arguing that \"distasteful\" humorous items are not \"hate speech\" or fraudulent efforts to mislead people about the epidemic. ABC countered by noting some countries, including Australia, have as-yet untested laws that could hold online sales platforms responsible for selling products that are deemed unethical.", "source":

Lombardy, Veneto", "body": "Populist Italian Senator Matteo Salvini slammed the leftist government's handling of the coronavirus as 14 new cases were confirmed in Lombardy and two more in Veneto.\n\nSalvini made his statements on Friday, slamming the leftist Italian coalition after the first case of the coronavirus was revealed in Codogno, Lombardy.\n\n\"I think of the controls on who enters and leaves Italy: obviously something is not working,\" Salvini said in comments reported by Il Giornale.\n\nThe League (Lega) leader went on to add that \"it is essential that, from today (if they haven't already done it yesterday), anyone who enters Italy, by any means of transport, from the raft to the aeroplane, be checked. And if it comes from some areas, it will be isolated for fifteen days. As other countries do.\"\n\nSalvini added that he would be returning to Milan stating that he found the situation \"worrying.\"\n\nA total of 14 cases were confirmed in Lombardy and some 30,000 people placed in isolation in various villages in towns in the commune of Lodi.\n\nAccording to Il Giornale, \"patient zero\" in Italy is a 38-year-old from Castiglione d'Adda who works for the company Unilever and is believed to have been infected in late January but did not show up to a local hospital until Thursday evening with severe respiratory symptoms.\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the virus, authorities tested people close to the 38-year-old, including his pregnant wife who also tested positive for the virus.\n\nAlong with the cases in Lombardy, two more cases of the virus were diagnosed in Padua and were identified as two elderly people who live on the Euganean Hills near Padua. Both have been placed in isolation.\n\nWhile most of the infections in Europe have been linked to those travelling from the Wuhan area of China where the coronavirus first originated or elsewhere in the East Asian region, others, like researcher Vittoria Colizza, are concerned with the possibility of the virus spreading in Africa.\n\nSpeaking to Italian media, Colizza said Egypt, South Africa, and Algeria were particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus.\n\nWhile he noted that all three countries were in the best position in Africa to contain the virus due to their relative quality of healthcare, he said that countries like Nigeria, Sudan, Angola, and others could see the virus spread rapidly with less guarantee of containment.\n\n\"The relationship between air flights with China and the possibility of contagion in Africa it is very strong,\" Colizza said.\n\n\"Half of it is insured by Ethiopian Airlines, which has not stopped flights. But it must be said that if they stop 100 per cent, the possibility of importing the virus really stops. If, on the other hand, they are reduced, even by 90 per cent, the possibility of an infection is only delayed.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"},

-- Iran's health ministry raised Sunday the death toll from the new virus to 8 people in the Middle Eastern country, amid concerns that clusters there, as well as in Italy and South Korea, could signal a serious new stage in its global spread.\n\nHealth ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told state TV that there were now 43 confirmed cases of the illness in Iran.\n\nThe outbreak in Iran has centered on the holy city of Qom, where officials say travellers from China brought the new coronavirus.\n\nIran reported its first case of the virus last Wednesday.\n\nJahanpour added that the 15 newly confirmed cases included 7 in Qom, four in the capital, Tehran, two in the northern Gilan province, one in the central Markazi province, and one from town of Tonekabon in the northern Mazandaran province, who died of the illness.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Iran's health minister acknowledged that travel from China brought the new virus to the country.\n\nSaeed Namaki told state TV that the virus came from China to the holy city of Qom in central Iran. He said that one the Iranian dead from the virus was a merchant who regularly shuttled between the two countries using indirect flights in recent weeks, after Iran stopped direct passenger flights to China.\n\nNamaki also defended the government's handling of the outbreak, saying it was being \"transparent.\" He said it would help make face-masks and sanitizers available for Iranians, amid concerns that stocks were running low in the capital's pharmacies.\n\nIran is also producing kits for diagnosis of the infection, he added.\n\nNamaki urged people not to visit Qom, which is a major destination for Shiite pilgrims.\n\n\"We obviously do not recommend traveling to Qom and other pilgrimage cities,\" Namaki said.\n\nSchools and religious seminaries closed\n\nThe government has closed down schools and religious seminaries in the holy city of Qom, where the virus first killed two elderly patients last week. Schools in Tehran and four other cities were closed as well, starting Sunday for two days.\n\nIran has also set up 36 screening stations at different ports of entry to the country to check for possibly infected travellers, he added.\n\nIraq and Pakistan, which share borders with Iran, have already taken preventive measures to limit the spread of the virus from Iranian travellers.\n\nOfficials in the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, which shares a long frontier with Iran, have declared an emergency as they seek to stop the spread of the virus via the Taftan border crossing with Iran.\n\nInfected travellers from Iran already have been discovered in Lebanon and Canada.\n\nLebanon's first case of the new virus was discovered on a flight from the Iranian city of Qom this week.\n\nSaudi Arabia has ordered anyone traveling from Iran to wait at least 14 days before entering the kingdom as it seeks to prevent the spread of the virus to the Muslim pilgrimage sites of Mecca and Medina.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "breitbart_jerusalem@breitbart.com", "name": "Breitbart Jerusalem", "type":

number of cases of the new coronavirus leapt upward, with dozens of new confirmed cases reported in Lombardy, the northern region which includes the country's financial capital, Milan.\n\nThe total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Italy had reached 115 on Sunday, state TV said following an announcement by Lombardy Gov. Attilio Fontana that there are 89 cases in his region. Most of those cases have popped up in small towns in the countryside, although Milan has at least one case.\n\nAlmost all of Italy's cases are clustered in the north, with roughly a dozen towns on lockdown - meaning that people are not allowed to enter or leave the towns' boundaries.\n\nAfter Lombardy, the next hardest-hit region is Veneto, in the northeast, with at least 17 cases.\n\nItalians\u00b4 cherished Sunday routines - from soccer to church-going - were being touched by the spread of the contagion, almost entirely based in the north. Sports events in the affected northern areas, including local kids\u00b4 sports team practices to three Serie A (top major league) soccer matches, were cancelled.\n\nBishops in several dioceses in northern Italy issued directives that holy water fonts be kept empty, that communion wafers be placed in the hands of the faithful and not directly into their mouths by priests celebrating Mass and that congregants refrain from shaking hands or exchanging kisses during the symbolic Sign of the Peace ritual.\n\nIn a coincidence, the Vatican official in charge of the office dealing with propagating the faith hails from one of the hardest-hit towns, Codogno. Archbishop Rino Fisichella, whose siblings live in the town, declined to dramatize the measures. \"It\u00b4s obvious that we need to use all necessary prudence\" to avoid spreading the virus among the faithful, he said.\n\nItaly\u00b4s first cases - that of a married Chinese couple who were on vacation in Rome - surfaced in early February.\n\nTo date, two deaths - of elderly persons in the north - have been reported.\n\nOf those hospitalized in Italy, at least 18 people were in intensive care on Sunday, according to officials.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

"body": "China's year-round legislature will meet next week to discuss postponing the annual session convening every lawmaker in the \"National People's Congress\" (NPC), a body that typically approves laws already decided by senior Communist Party officials.\n\nMembers of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a large committee of prominent Chinese celebrities and businesspeople that offers advice to the NPC, are also considering delaying their meeting, scheduled for March. Rescheduling the meeting would reveal significant fears amid high-level Communist Party officials that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in the country will take more than a month to control. In January, state propaganda outlets claimed that evidence suggested the outbreak was already waning.\n\nThe \"two sessions\" - the Communist Party's largest political gathering and a major event Beijing uses to deceive the world into thinking of it as a democracy - normally convene thousands of people, making it the kind of large assembly that poses a significant public health threat.\n\nThe Communist Party alerted the world to its discovery of a never-before-seen form of coronavirus on January 20, originating in the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. It has since infected over 70,000 people on four continents and killed over 1,000. The outbreak was likely made worse by communist officials hiding its existence between mid-December, when locals first reported becoming aware of a disease spreading, to the date in which the World Health Organization (WHO) spread China's warning that the virus had been identified. During those days, officials in Wuhan allowed several large public gatherings, including a banquet feeding 130,000 people, mostly seniors.\n\nXinhua, a Chinese government news agency, reported on Monday that the Standing Committee - the part of the legislature that convenes year-round, as opposed to the nearly 3,000 people that make up the entire NPC - will meet \"in late February\" to discuss changing the dates of the currently scheduled full session.\n\nAccording to the report, NPC officials are considering canceling the event not because a delegate may spread coronavirus among Communist Party officials, but because many of the delegates invited also hold positions in local government and their absence may delay the government's response in affected communities. About a third of NPC members also hold local positions.\n\n\"Many of the nearly 3,000 NPC deputies, including leading officials at the municipal, provincial levels and other fields, are fighting at the frontlines of the epidemic battle,\" Xinhua noted. \"After careful evaluation, the Council of Chairpersons decided that it is necessary to postpone the annual legislative session to allow efforts to be concentrated on containing the epidemic. This is in line with putting people's lives and health as the top priority.\"\n\nOnly the Standing Committee, however, can make the decision to postpone the meeting, necessitating yet another meeting to postpone the meeting.\n\nThe Global Times, China's more belligerent English-language propaganda outlet, published an article Monday predicting that any delay in holding the \"two sessions\" would only push them later into March, apparently responding to concerns that the delay indicates Beijing has little faith in Party members to swiftly contain the virus.\n\n\"The proposal to delay indicates that the central government puts epidemic prevention and control work as its top priority, showing its highly responsible stance not only to the Chinese people but also to the work,\" a Global Times \"expert\" identified as Zhuang Deshui, said in the article.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported that the CPPCC - which last year included among its members Jackie Chan and Yao Ming - was similarly expecting to cancel its session. A source told the newspaper that, while the public reason for postponing the meetings would be not to take key local officials out of their home provinces while doing important Party work to contain the virus, the real reason was fear that the lawmakers themselves would be infected.\n\n\"The risk of cross infections would be very high for nearly 8,000 people ... as well as staff responsible for administering the meetings, under the same roof of the Great Hall of the People,\" the anonymous \"source who is familiar with the preparations\" said. \"The health risk of convening the annual sessions early next month would be too high when the coronavirus outbreak has not yet been effectively contained.\"\n\nThe \"two sessions\" are pivotal to Communist Party networking, as they bring together senior Party officials from the whole country for a typically two-week affair in Beijing. Dictator Xi Jinping's government has attempted to excite the general public about the meetings through its propaganda wings, urging all to unite in \"building a moderately prosperous society,\" the stated goal of the meeting in a 2018 hip-hop song about the sessions.\n\n\"As is much anticipated, the annual Two Sessions have already opened,\" the rap begins, referring to the two sessions of Congress. \"So many highlights, they shouldn't be missed!\"\n\nAt press time, international health experts have documented 71,902 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide, over 70,500 of them in China. Of these, 1,775 people have died, most within China. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines, and France have documented deaths among their patients.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) began what Xinhua called \"field inspections\" in China on Monday meant to evaluate China's response to the virus. The WHO team will not visit Wuhan or any place in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

to Coronavirus", "body": "Chinese state propaganda outlet Global Times declared on Thursday that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), much of which lacks scientific backing, is showing promise as an effective treatment for the country's ongoing coronavirus outbreak.\n\nInterest in TCM has surged in recent years among alternative health practitioners, with sales of TCM methods such as acupuncture and Tai Chi bringing in around $50 billion in annual revenue to China's economy. Amid the interest, Chinese health authorities recently encouraged TCM practitioners to help find a cure for the coronavirus outbreak, with initials findings allegedly yielding \"optimistic results.\"\n\nChina's National Health Commission on Wednesday included TCM in its latest diagnosis and treatment scheme, demanding \"greater efforts of treatment integrating TCM and Western medicine\" to help contain the virus.\n\nProvincial health authorities in East China's Zhejiang and Shandong, South China's Guangdong and Northwest China's Gansu and Qinghai, also announced further practice of the treatment.\n\nThe Times goes on to claim that TCM doctors and experts have argued that combining it with scientific medicine has proven the ability to shorten the treatment process. It states that, while TCM has been found to have \"significant effects\" in mild and moderate cases of the coronavirus, Western medicine continues to lag behind.\n\nIt specifically cites the \"renowned Chinese respiratory expert\" Zhong Nanshan, who told a press conference in Guangdong on Tuesday that he believes in the \"positive effectiveness of TCM in treating patients in their early and middle stages, including killing the virus, reducing opportunities of the virus entering bodies and decreasing the occurrences of Cytokine storm.\"\n\nThe Times also quotes the deputy director of the Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Lei Genping, who despite noting that TCM fails to provide scientific explanations of its working mechanisms insists that he does solve a range of medical issues.\n\n\"After days of ward rounds, we found that almost every patient has glossy coating on their tongues, which means that they are affected by dampness,\" Lei explained. \"Some patients have cough, and bitter and dry mouth together with fever. We believe the patients lack yang, so we added bupleurum root and cassia twig into their prescriptions.\"\n\nThe article does eventually admit that many qualified doctors and scientists have expressed serious doubts over the validity of TCM given that it has barely any scientific backing. Two molecular genetics studies published in 2012 showed how many of the treatments can be harmful, with many unlisted ingredients known to cause cancer.\n\n\"Some Chinese herbal products have been contaminated with toxic compounds, heavy metals, pesticides, and microorganisms and may have serious side effects,\" notes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in its analysis of the medicine. \"Manufacturing errors, in which one herb is mistakenly replaced with another, also have resulted in serious complications.\"\n\nLast year, the World Health Organization (WHO), the most important global body trying to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus, accepted TCM as a legitimate form of treatment. The decision was criticized by scientists including the editors of the Scientific American magazine, who described it as an \"egregious lapse in evidence-based thinking and practice.\"\n\n\"Data supporting the effectiveness of most traditional remedies are scant, at best,\" the magazine wrote in an editorial. \"An extensive assessment was done in 2009 by researchers at the University of Maryland: they looked at 70 review papers evaluating TCM, including acupuncture. None of the studies proved conclusive because the data were either too paltry or did not meet testing standards.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"},

Spreads in Iran, May Have Infected Canadian Visitor", "body": "The Wuhan coronavirus spread further through Iran on Friday, with a total of 13 new cases reported in several other cities besides Qom, where the first infections were reported this week.\n\nThere may also be an Iranian connection to what Canadian officials described as a \"sentinel event,\" the first confirmed case of infection in a person who has never visited China or had contact with people who did. The Canadian patient did recently travel to Iran.\n\nIranian state media reported on Friday that infections have been detected in Tehran, Babol, Isfahan, Rasht, and other cities in addition to Qom, where four of the first five cases originated. The fifth was an individual from Qom who began displaying symptoms while visiting the city of Arak. A total of 13 new cases were reported, seven of them in Qom.\n\nHealth Ministry official Minou Mohrez said the coronavirus outbreak may have begun in Qom and been spread to other cities by travelers. \"It's possible that it exists in all cities in Iran,\" she warned.\n\nMohrez also gave the first official indication of how the virus reached Iran. \"It's clear that new coronavirus has circulated in the country and probably the source of this illness was Chinese workers who work in the city of Qom and had traveled to China,\" she stated.\n\nVoters in Iran's parliamentary election, already suffering from low turnout because the public views it as rigged in favor of hardline theocrats, were photographed at the polls in Qom wearing protective surgical masks.\n\nCanadian officials on Friday reported that a woman in her 30s who recently returned to British Columbia from a trip to Iran has been tentatively diagnosed with the Wuhan virus, becoming Canada's ninth known infection.\n\nThe case was interpreted as an \"indicators that there's more widespread transmission,\" according to health official Dr. Bonnie Henry. Final results from testing at one of Canada's national laboratories are still pending.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday described the spread of the disease in Iran as \"very worrisome.\" WHO noted that a woman in Lebanon may also have contracted the virus while visiting Iran.\n\nWHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the emergence of the virus in Iran was a sign that the \"window of opportunity is narrowing\" for controlling the epidemic.\n\n\"We need to act quickly before it closes completely. This outbreak could still go in any direction,\" he warned.\n\nWHO officials said Iran has the \"basic capacity\" to diagnose the coronavirus and keep it from spreading rapidly, which is not very reassuring. These officials said they were worried about the virus spreading from Iran into countries even less capable of detecting or controlling it. They were also troubled by the inability of Iranian doctors to determine exactly how the virus reached their country.\n\n\"The concern is that we're seeing a very rapid increase in a matter of days,\" WHO director of infectious hazard preparedness Sylvie Briand said.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com",
