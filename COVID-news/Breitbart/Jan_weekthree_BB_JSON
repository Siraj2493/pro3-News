The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported this weekend it had found evidence of at least two cases not documented in official data, including one in Shanghai, where Chinese officials had claimed the virus had not yet reached.\n\nThose affected by the virus exhibit acute respiratory infection symptoms and many have developed severe pneumonia. The virus's impact on the lungs suggests that it may be airborne; Chinese authorities urged individuals to wear masks to stop it from spreading.\n\nThe government of Hong Kong made face masks illegal last year in response to anti-communist protests; the region's top court decreed the ban unconstitutional, but some police still attempt to enforce it.\n\nOfficials say the virus likely originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million people. According to the CDC, some of those diagnosed with carrying the virus - now identified as a new mutation of coronavirus - had no contact with the seafood market in question, suggesting the virus may spread from person to person, not just animal-to-person. Authorities in the region have implemented screening checks at airports and other ports of entry and local governments in areas like Hong Kong expanded police power to quarantine suspected patients.\n\nLunar New Year, a holiday celebrated throughout Asia and considered one of the heaviest travel seasons on the continent is on Saturday, exacerbating concerns of a regional or global outbreak. Yet the Global Times, an English-language Chinese Communist Party propaganda outlet, insisted on Monday that Chinese \"experts\" were not alarmed.\n\n\"Hospitals and authorities said the spread of the disease is no cause for panic and none was witnessed in the affected cities and hospitals that were visited by reporters has been felt at the scenes,\" the Global Times noted in an article titled, \"Chinese Hospitals Actively Respond to Outbreak of Wuhan Pneumonia; Analysts Suggest No Need to Panic.\" Nurses and other medical staff at various hospitals quoted in the piece, but not identified by name, all insisted that the more immediate concern for them was influenza, not the new virus, as it is \"peak flu season\" and the symptoms are similar.\n\nAccording to the Global Times, the hospitals were using \"new and stronger measures\" to screen potential patients and there was \"no indication of panic\" among health workers.\n\n\"There is no need to overreact. If you haven't been in contact with someone with a fever or haven't been to Wuhan, there is little chance you will get infected,\" an unnamed nurse said.\n\nThe Global Times admitted in passing that the hospital its reporters visited \"is not yet able to screen for the new coronavirus,\" which calls into question what \"new and stronger measures\" it was using to screen for the virus. One of the specific measures identified, at a hospital in Shanghai, was the hanging of \"a large banner showing tips.\" It nonetheless quoted alleged experts praising the government of dictator Xi Jinping.\n\n\"We found the pneumonia virus in a very short time, which illustrates our improved overall ability. We found the new coronavirus independently in about 10 days, but during the SARS epidemic, it was foreign experts who found the virus after three or so months,\" Chinese epidemiologist Zeng Guang told the propaganda outlet.\n\nSudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) originated in China between 2002 and 2003 and killed 774 people before containment measures implemented stopped its spread. The culprit in that outbreak was also a previously unrecognized coronavirus.\n\nIn another article, the state newspaper insisted that \"Chinese society should be vigilant but should not be in panic\" as the Lunar New Year and accompanying Spring Festival approached. The newspaper also mildly scolded Xi's predecessors for their handling of SARS.\n\n\"In the early moments of SARS, there was concealment in China. This must not be repeated,\" the Global Times noted.\n\nChina's state news agency, Xinhua, went out of its way to confirm Xi Jinping - whose tenure has been marred by a series of medical disasters - was personally overseeing China's response to the new virus.\n\n\"President Xi Jinping has ordered resolute efforts to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus that caused cases of pneumonia,\" Xinhua reported. \"Instructing on the work related to the pneumonia situation, Xi ... stressed putting people's safety and health as the top priority.\"\n\nChina's National Health Commission offered little signs of confidence on Sunday, saying in a press statement that \"the source of the new type of coronavirus has not been found, we do not fully understand how the virus is transmitted, and changes in the virus still need to be closely monitored.\"\n\nNews of the virus spreading in Wuhan first surfaced in early January as officials in Hong Kong, whose government is slightly more publicly accessible than communist China's, addressed concerns in the city of travelers bringing the virus with them. Hong Kong is currently in its seventh month of widespread protests against communism that routinely attract crowds of hundreds of thousands and, at its peak, assembled millions. At the time, Hong Kong had identified 30 individuals who showed signs of respiratory illness after traveling to Wuhan.By Monday, the Global Times said that number had tripled to 90 potential cases.\n\nChinese government statistics released Monday did not count any of the suspected Hong Kong cases as confirmed, suggesting other respiratory illnesses in that case. China has confirmed 217 infected patients according to Xinhua - 136 confirmed in the last weekend in Wuhan.\n\nTwo patients in Beijing have also tested positive for the new virus and one in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, according to the Associated Press. All had visited Wuhan.\n\nChinese officials first offered official word on the virus at the national level with a social media post this weekend, the South China Morning Post noted, that insisted that rumors of health workers secretly treating patients not documented as carrying the virus were untrue. On Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang elaborated on how the Communist Party is allegedly working to keep others abroad safe from the outbreak.\n\n\"Here I want to stress that since the outbreak, China has taken proactive measures to handle that in a serious and professional manner,\" Geng told reporters at his regular briefing. \"We have worked to formulate strict prevention and control scheme, spared no effort to treat the patients, properly managed close contacts, carried out in-depth epidemiological investigations, released the information on epidemic prevention and control in time, and launched campaign [sic] to raise the awareness of the disease.\"\n\n\"We have shared with the WHO the information on the genome sequence of the new coronavirus as soon as possible,\" Geng continued. \"After receiving notification of cases from relevant countries, China has taken that seriously and stayed in close communication with all parties through bilateral and multilateral channels, while strengthening cooperation with all-out efforts to deal with them.\"\n\nThe genome sequence is necessary to match patients with suspect symptoms with the virus and confirm they are not carrying a different infection. South Korea confirmed its first case on Monday, a woman who attempted to enter the country through Seoul after visiting Wuhan.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Maricopa County, Arizona, resident is the fifth confirmed coronavirus case in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Sunday.\n\nThe development comes after the federal public health agency said a fourth case was confirmed in Orange County, California. Other cases have been confirmed in Orange County, California, Washington state, and Chicago.\n\nThe virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. It is a member of the coronavirus family that's a close cousin to the deadly SARS and MERS viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past.\n\nDozens of people have died from the virus in China, which has issued massive travel bans in hard-hit sections of that country to try to stem spread of the virus. The U.S. consulate in Wuhan announced Sunday that it would evacuate its personnel and some private citizens aboard a charter flight.\n\nThe CDC expects more Americans to be diagnosed with the newly discovered virus, which is believed to have an incubation period of about two weeks, as worldwide the number of confirmed cases nears 2,000. The CDC is screening passengers on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan at five major airports in Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nGuidance from the CDC advises that people who have had casual contact with the patient are at \"minimal risk\" for developing infection.\n\n\"CDC believes the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this time, but the situation is evolving rapidly,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Friday. \"We have our best people working on this problem.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) urged the Trump administration to consider a travel ban on visitors from China as public health concerns grow.\n\n\"Once again, a deadly virus is emanating from the People's Republic of China. The Wuhan coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China, killing at least seventeen individuals so far. The disease has now spread to Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea,\" Cotton wrote in a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar, which was obtained exclusively by Breitbart News. \"At least one case has been confirmed in the United States. I'm confident that the United States Government is undertaking all possible measures to contain the spread of the disease, but I'm deeply concerned that waging an efficient and successful campaign against this virus depends on the trustworthiness and transparency of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), an organization with a horrendous history in these matters.\"\n\n\"I urge the Department of Health and Human Services to carefully vet any information being passed from its contacts in Beijing. If you have reason to believe that U.S. officials are being provided with false or misleading information about the disease from Chinese government officials, I ask that you notify Congress

Cities, 20 Million People over Virus", "body": "Chinese authorities added four cities to their lockdown of Wuhan, home to a deadly new virus spreading rapidly, on Thursday afternoon, bringing the total population within the transport shutdown zone to about 20 million people.\n\nWuhan itself is home to 11 million people and sits in the heart of central China, making it a major transportation hub where many train connections to various provinces convene. Wuhan also boasts an international airport; Beijing suspended all flights in or out late Wednesday to contain the virus. An estimated 30,000 people flew out of the Wuhan airport daily before the lockdown.\n\nThe sprawling measures are a response to a virus believed to have originated in Wuhan in December that has now been confirmed to infect over 500 people and kill 17. Authorities suspect that the virus first jumped from wild animal meat to humans at a seafood and game market in Wuhan and denied evidence that the virus was capable of human-to-human transmission until this week. On Monday, Chinese health officials announced they had identified the virus as being part of the coronavirus family, a relative of the virus responsible for the Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 that killed nearly 800 people.\n\nScientists in China published a paper on Wednesday revealing findings that link the virus's DNA structure to snakes native to the Wuhan region.\n\nThe virus produces flu-like symptoms including fevers, coughs, and other respiratory ailments before ultimately causing pneumonia.\n\nThe \"Wuhan virus\" outbreak has arrived in time for what is typically one of the highest-travel events of the year in Asia, Lunar New Year, which takes place on Saturday. Beijing and several other large Chinese cities have canceled Lunar New Year celebrations at temples and public plazas to avoid assembling large numbers of people in contained spaces and exacerbating the outbreak.\n\nThe New York Times, citing Chinese officials, reported that the cities of Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi, and Zhijiang joined Wuhan in having all trains into or out of the cities canceled and other travel restrictions imposed; most of the new restrictions took effect at midnight local time. The new travel limitations now affect about 20 million people living in the greater Wuhan area; Wuhan is the regional capital of Hubei province.\n\nAccording to Hong Kong's RTHK broadcaster, in addition to limits on public transportation, authorities set up checkpoints to inspect every vehicle coming into the city for livestock. Huanggang announced it would also shut down bars and movie theaters to prevent large gatherings.\n\nSome global health officials have expressed concern that the measures have come too late, particularly given the documentation of several cases outside of China and reports of Wuhan residents sneaking out of the city before the travel restrictions took effect. Wuhan residents on Weibo, China's heavily censored legal social media site, reportedly began using the hashtag \"escape from Wuhan\" overnight to describe how they evaded police and crossed city limits. Some of them openly admitted to having a fever and taking medication before being tested to avoid being isolated. Among those was a woman who traveled out of Wuhan to France and posted on WeChat, another Chinese censored social media outlet, that she had a fever when she left the city but successfully fooled authorities into letting her into France.\n\n\"I had a fever and a cough before I left - I was so scared. I quickly took some medicine and checked my temperature. Luckily the temperature was controlled and I had a smooth journey through the border,\" she wrote.\n\nWithin Wuhan, reports independent from the communist government report panic and fear.\n\n\"Some residents said they were on the 'verge of tears' as they read news of the lockdown, adding that their families' lives were 'threatened constantly and the target of online abuse,'\" RTHK reported, citing agitated social media posts on Weibo. The Chinese regime also appears to be allowing comments critical of the local Wuhan government to remain online without censorship, but not remarks critical of the central Communist Party powers in Beijing. Authorities revealed that they had \"handled\" eight individuals for posting comments on social media that the Communist Party did not approve of, but did not elaborate on how they \"handled\" these cases or if these individuals retained their freedom.\n\nIn an attempt to boost morale and paint a more positive photo of the situation, the Global Times published a \"salute to Wuhan citizens\" on Thursday for their \"great contribution to stop the uncontrolled spread of the epidemic.\"\n\n\"As a media organization, we want to pay tribute to the city of Wuhan and its over 10 million citizens. We also believe that the entire Chinese nation will pay tribute to Wuhan citizens who think of the big picture at this critical moment,\" the newspaper declared.\n\nResidents' attempts to avoid isolation and containment appear to have resulted in health officials documenting cases in nearly every corner of the country. The Global Times, a Chinese state propaganda outlet, reported on Wednesday that authorities identified patients carrying coronavirus as far from Wuhan as Xinjiang, the largely Uyghur province bordering Afghanistan, threatening the war-torn region of west Asia. Outside of China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States have identified patients carrying the virus.\n\nThe latest estimates from the World Health Organization at press time are that officials have confirmed 581 cases of the new virus and 17 patients have died. Among those still living, doctors have identified 95 people as having \"severe\" cases. The overwhelming majority of cases have been identified within China.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Says Texas Research Physician", "body": "HOUSTON, Texas -- A physician tasked with developing a vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus-type illnesses says this latest virus is the third variant since 2002. The doctor expressed concern about the frequency of new coronavirus contagions.\n\n\"This is the third new coronavirus since the turn of the century,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the Molecular, Virology, and Microbiology Department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston told Breitbart Texas in a phone interview. \"This is serious business.\"\n\nThe doctor referenced the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) discovery in 2002, the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) discovery in 2012, and the Wuhan coronavirus in 2020.\n\n\"It is still very early,\" Dr. Hotez said in reference to a question about what we know about the Wuhan coronavirus. \"What we don't know is much more than what we do know.\"\n\nHe does not believe the virus will be as deadly as SARS, which had about a 10 percent mortality rate. If the information provided by the Chinese government is correct, the current disclosed mortality rate is currently just under two percent. Early on Wednesday, Chinese officials directly reported nine deaths out of 479 reported cases.\n\n\"We will know more in the coming weeks,\" the doctor continued. \"Right now, it appears to be harder to transmit than the previous viruses, the flu, or measles.\"\n\n\"We are now seeing person-to-person spreading of the virus,\" he added. \"We will know more in the coming weeks.\"\n\nTo help prevent the spread of the virus, the doctor suggested prevention methods similar to the common cold or flu. This includes frequent hand washing, covering mouths during a cough or sneeze, and staying away from people who might be infected.\n\nChinese National Health Commission Vice-Minister Li Bin told reporters in a Wednesday (January 22) press conference regarding the Wuhan coronavirus (also known as 2019-nCo) that there is a \"possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease,\" the AFP reported. The news agency reported the number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 440.\n\nDr. Hotez said his researchers have not yet determined if a prototype vaccine developed for SARS will be effective against the new coronavirus.\n\nThe doctor said he is more concerned about this year's flu season. He said at least six children under the age of 16 have died from flu-related symptoms since October 2019.\n\n\"If you're concerned about your health, get a flu vaccine,\" Dr. Hotez urged.", "source":

Tom Cotton (R-AR) is urging President Donald Trump's administration to consider implementing a ban on travelers from China to the United States over the Chinese Communist Party's mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak that has left more than a dozen people dead.\n\nIn a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar obtained exclusively by Breitbart News ahead of its public release, Cotton raises serious public health concerns over the coronavirus and in particular the disease making its way to America's shores through weak screening that could cause an outbreak here.\n\n\"I write to you today about the continued spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, which has now arrived on American soil,\" Cotton wrote in the Wednesday letter, which came after the first U.S. case of coronavirus was confirmed in Washington state earlier this week. \"Once again, a deadly virus is emanating from the People's Republic of China. The Wuhan coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China, killing at least seventeen individuals so far. The disease has now spread to Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea. At least one case has been confirmed in the United States. I'm confident that the United States Government is undertaking all possible measures to contain the spread of the disease, but I'm deeply concerned that waging an efficient and successful campaign against this virus depends on the trustworthiness and transparency of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), an organization with a horrendous history in these matters.\"\n\nA Cotton aide told Breitbart News that the Chinese Communist government's history with such disease outbreaks -- pointing specifically to the SARS outbreak -- is \"terrible,\" especially when it comes to transparency. The outbreak origins of the Wuhan coronavirus, the Cotton aide noted, is \"eerily similar\" to the SARS outbreak -- something even the New York Times agrees with. Cotton, the aide told Breitbart News, wants to be sure that HHS and the whole U.S. government approach the Chinese Communists' handling of this disease scare with \"extreme skepticism\" and \"prepare for the worst.\"\n\n\"The numbers we have now are almost certainly underreported, and in the event that this continues to grow rapidly, we have to prepare the strongest possible measures to protect Americans: screening people arriving from China, and possibly a travel ban,\" the Cotton aide told Breitbart News.\n\nSen. Cotton noted in his letter to Azar that the Chinese Communist Party has a history of providing misleading and false information on public health scares.\n\n\"As you know, in the past the CCP has lied, falsified statistics, and suppressed information about the outbreak of disease in order to protect its political standing and cover for its own incompetence,\" Cotton wrote. \"In 2002 and 2003, the SARS virus killed nearly 800 people and infected over 8,000 worldwide after the CCP denied there was even a health crisis. During the outbreak, CCP officials imposed a months-long blackout on media coverage of the disease. The CCP, with its totalitarian Marxist-Leninistideology, reflexively covers up scandals that could threaten its power.\"\n\nHe urged Secretary Azar to immediately brief Congress if the administration becomes aware of misinformation from the Chinese Communists with regard to the coronavirus.\n\n\"For these reasons, the CCP's calls for transparency about the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus are deeply suspect,\" Cotton wrote. \"I urge the Department of Health and Human Services to carefully vet any information being passed from its contacts in Beijing. If you have reason to believe that U.S. officials are being provided with false or misleading information about the disease from Chinese government officials, I ask that you notify Congress immediately.\"\n\nCotton then noted that the administration should be considering banning travel from China to the United States to prevent spread of the disease to America's shores.\n\n\"Moreover, given China's dismal record on these matters, your Department and all relevant agencies of the U.S. Government must be proactive in planning for scenarios where this infection continues to spread,\" Cotton wrote. \"Measures such as screening all travelers from the People's Republic of China and, if necessary, banning entry to those traveling from China must be contemplated and prepared in order to keep Americans safe. It is imperative that the United States, China, and other relevant governments and international bodies cooperate to prevent this virus from becoming a pandemic. This cooperation must be conducted on the basis of facts, not the CCP's political fiction.\"\n\nPresident Trump's travel ban issued at the beginning of his administration banned travel into the United States from several countries, including North Korea, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. The ban was challenged by Democrats, but the U.S. Supreme Court upheld it. Trump has considered in recent days expanding the travel ban to several other countries, including reportedly Belarus, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, and Myanmar -- also known as Burma.\n\nThe president could expand the travel ban on a temporary basis to China, as Cotton is urging consideration of, if the Chinese cannot get control of the coronavirus.", "source": {"uri":

Scanning Plane Passengers for 'Wuhan' Virus | Breitbart", "body": "Video footage shared on Sunday night of plane passengers reportedly being tested for the deadly \"Wuhan\" virus is amplifying fear of a global pandemic.\n\nSixth Tone - \"a media start-up under party oversight\" according to Foreign Policy - Head of News David Paulk tweeted a video reportedly of passengers on a domestic flight out of Wuhan being scanned by medics in antiviral gear late Sunday night. The footage, already shared over 1,000 times, continues to fuel a rapid increase in concern over the greater threat that the city's eponymous new virus will escape its already limited containment.\n\nThe video remains unverified by U.S. sources, though similar footage was reportedly captured by another user on Chinese social media. The source claimed the scans were being done after the domestic flight from Wuhan landed at its destination after complaints that one of the passengers was suffering from a fever.\n\nThe state-funded \"Beijing News\" recently released similar footage of scans being done on passengers before takeoff on another flight departing Wuhan, submitted by an individual identified only as \"Ms. Cheng.\" The footage was taken on a January 12 trip from Wuhan to Macau, where passengers were checked after landing before being allowed to leave the aircraft. China is insisting there is \"no need to panic\" as they attempt to respond to the illness.\n\nDespite efforts at containment, the SARS-like \"coronavirus\" has already been confirmed in cases across Beijing, Shenzhen, and Shanghai. Worryingly, it has also escaped China: sighting have been reported in Thailand, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nIn response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will begin screening all passengers from China. \"Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation,\" CDC Director Dr. Martin Cetron said in a press release.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_church@breitbart.com", "name": "Nate Church", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Containment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Policy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macau"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Macau"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Sub_Sea_Tours", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Sub Sea Tours", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/china-medics-wuhan-virus-getty.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 62}, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 62, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1420048276", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-23", "time": "01:10:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-23T01:10:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-23T00:09:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/01/22/north-korea-bans-all-foreigners-response-chinese-virus/", "title": "North Korea Bans All Foreigners in Response to Chinese Virus", "body": "North Korea's communist regime banned all foreign visitors from entering the country on Tuesday as a precaution against the recent outbreak of a new coronavirus in China, according to tourist companies who operate in the country.\n\nBeijing-based Koryo Tours told local media outlets that it was contacted by a business partner in North Korea about the measure on Tuesday, confirming that it would apply to all foreign visitors including those traveling on business. Increasing numbers of Chinese have visited North Korea in recent years amid warming relations and an expansion of the state-run tourism industry.\n\nPyongyang's state propaganda newspaper Rodong Sinmun did not mention such measures on Wednesday but did report on the outbreak in China, describing it as having \"spread rapidly,\" while confirming that Chinese health authorities were taking \"corresponding measures.\"\n\nThe bold measure is an indication of the level of concern among North Korean authorities, who are treating it as a precaution against the spread of infectious diseases. The country's population is suspected to be particularly vulnerable because of the chronic food shortages and lack of essential medical supplies, meaning an aggressive outbreak could wipe out huge numbers of people.\n\nThe move is expected to place additional strain on North Korea, with foreign tourism an integral part of maintaining the communist regime's finances. Foreign tourists are estimated to contribute around $45 million USD every year, providing a vital source of income that avoids economic sanctions and allows them access to foreign currency.\n\n\"This is bad news for North Korea, but I suspect the greater concern is the public health risk,\" Daniel Pinkston, a lecturer in international relations at Alabama's Troy University, told the South China Morning Post. \"[The outbreak of] a disease would have a greater impact on its society and pose a greater challenge for it than the lost tourism revenue.\"\n\nAt least nine people have died and a further 481 identified as carrying the virus internationally.

In October 2014, it similarly closed its borders to all foreign tourists for over four months to avoid any exposure to the Ebola virus, despite the fact that no cases had been reported in Asia.

Over Possible Coronavirus Symptoms", "body": "A passenger who landed at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) from Mexico City was immediately quarantined Wednesday evening after showing possible symptoms of the deadly coronavirus, U.S. health officials announced Thursday.\n\nThe traveler arrived at LAX via American Airlines flight 2546 at 6:45 p.m. local time and was swiftly hospitalized by first responders. The Los Angeles Fire Department conducted a \"deep contamination process\" after the patient was removed from the aircraft, according to Fox 5.\n\nU.S. health officials are reiterating the need to take precautions against the deadly virus, especially due to flu season being underway.\n\n\"If you're sick, if you're coughing, if you're sneezing, you need to stay away from other people,\" said Dr. Barbara Ferrer, head of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\n\nThe development comes as an unidentified Washington State man who recently returned from Wuhan, China -- where the illness appears to have originated from -- was confirmed to have caught the disease.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization said Thursday that a viral illness, which has killed 17 people and sickened hundreds, is not yet an international health emergency.\n\nThe decision came after Chinese authorities moved to lock down three cities on Thursday and canceled major events in the capital, Beijing, during the Lunar New Year holiday period to try to contain the new virus.\n\nThe United Nations health agency announced the decision after independent experts spent two days assessing information about the spread of the newly identified coronavirus.\n\nWHO defines a global emergency as an \"extraordinary event\" that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. Previous global emergencies have been declared for the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas, the swine flu pandemic, and polio.\n\nA declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous foreign governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries.

Road' Connects Africa to Deadly Virus", "body": "China's years-long expansion into Africa - and the corresponding flood of Chinese workers establishing themselves there - has left the continent particularly vulnerable to the spread of a new iteration of coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.\n\nAs part of China's international \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" the Communist Party has signed deals worth billions of dollars with some of the continent's largest countries, such as Nigeria and Kenya, and some of its least stable, such as Zimbabwe and Uganda. China established its first overseas permanent military base in Djibouti, on the other side of the mouth of the Red Sea from Yemen, in 2017. In Rwanda, Chinese workers have set up camp to build the Standard Gauge Railway, an expensive international project that Beijing promised would connect Rwanda's capital to Kenya and Uganda.\n\nFacing a lack of trustworthy healthcare infrastructure, prior cases of Chinese citizens evading local immigration authorities, and simmering indigenous outbreaks, the potential arrival of the Wuhan virus presents a disastrous possibility for China's African business partners.\n\nChinese medical experts confirmed on Monday that they had identified the mystery virus as a type of coronavirus, the same type of virus responsible for the 2003 Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that killed nearly 800 people. A team of Chinese scientists posited that the source of the virus may be local snake meat, corresponding to Communist Party claims that the virus likely jumped from animal to human at a popular wild game and seafood market in Wuhan.\n\nWuhan is a city of 11 million in the heart of central China. Chinese authorities have placed it on lockdown along with four other cities in the area, isolating an estimated 20 million people by shutting down flights, public transportation, and inspecting private vehicles.\n\nReports estimate that the virus first began to affect people in December, placing the Chinese regime's moves to contain it about a month later than when residents were first exposed. The result has been a significant dissemination of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) placed the number of infected people at 584 during a press conference Thursday and stated that 575 of these were in China, though the WHO falsely includes the nation of Taiwan and autonomous regions such as Hong Kong in its definition of \"China.\" A total of 17 people have died at press time, all within \"China.\"\n\nOutside of China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, the United States, Taiwan, Macau, and Hong Kong have all confirmed cases of coronavirus.\n\nWhile the virus has not yet hit Africa, some of the nations with the closest ties to Beijing have issued health alerts for their residents.\n\n\"The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is currently coordinating a multisectoral technical group that is assessing and managing the risk of importation to Nigeria,\" the top health agency in the country said in a press alert this week. \"The Port Health Services unit of the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria has been placed on alert and has heightened screening measures at the points of entry.\"\n\n\"Nigerians are advised to remain calm. Travelers from Nigeria to Wuhan, China, are advised to avoid contact with sick people, animals (alive or dead), and animal markets,\" the advisory note suggested. \"Travelers from Wuhan to Nigeria, may be asked questions upon arrival by the Port Health Services unit at points of entry about symptoms of illness and travel history, and are advised to report immediately to NCDC, if they feel ill after a trip to Wuhan.\"\n\nKenyan officials similarly set up heightened security alerts, according to Kenya's the Nation.\n\nSouth Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases also published an alert and assurance that it had briefed the nation's doctors and medical staff on the currently available information on the virus. Local media also reported that points of entry to the country had increased security checks on individuals entering the country from Asia, though it remains unclear if that extends to individuals who had connecting flights outside of Asia but originally traveled from China.\n\nChina has significantly expanded its diplomatic and business footprint in Africa since the time of the SARS outbreak in 2003, when South Africa identified one carrier of the disease, the only one in the continent. The Belt and Road Initiative has entangled nearly every developing economy in Africa. China has signed deals with Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, and others to develop lucrative infrastructure projects - many of them railways to connect cities - in which those countries take out predatory loans to pay for the project, then use that money to pay imported Chinese workers.\n\n\"Africa is increasingly tied into the Chinese orbit that advocates for a new international order and a community of common destiny,\" Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program and director of the China program at the Stimson Center think tank, told Congress in 2018. \"China's economic statecraft in Africa has become one of the most prioritized and effective instruments in China's challenge to the current international order.\"\n\nMore recently, Zimbabwe signed deals with China that granted it $58 million in investment grants for alleged development.\n\nThe deals have alarmed many observers in Africa who see their fate increasingly tied to the authoritarian Communist Party. China has exacerbated tensions by using its technology arms to sell surveillance technology to African dictators and sending business representatives and workers that practice overt racism in front of African partners.\n\nKenyan workers on the Standard Gauge Railway have complained that the Chinese bosses overseeing the construction keep segregated facilities, refusing to eat in the same lunch areas as African workers or use the same vehicles to get to work sites. The Chinese government also refuses to print instructions for the railway construction in English or other local languages and instead only prints them in Chinese, guaranteeing that the Kenyan government will not have the ability to maintain the railway without Chinese supervision and help.\n\nIn one particularly egregious instance of racism, a Chinese businessman was deported from the country after calling all Kenyans and President Uhuru Kenyatta \"monkey people\" on video.\n\nThese close ties to China have caused alarm.\n\nKenya is at high risk of an outbreak caused by a new virus lurking in China, if travel inflows from the Asian country are anything to go by. The coronavirus has put the world on high alert with countries increasing fever checks at airports amid fears of a bigger outbreak,\" the Agence France-Presse (AFP) noted on Tuesday. \"Government statistics show that the number of international visitors through all points of entry in 2019 shot up to 2,048,834 compared to 2018, when arrivals were 2,025,206.\"\n\nKenya also has the dubious distinction of being home to Africa's most prominent immigration mess caused by China. In 2018, the Standard, a Kenyan newspaper, revealed that thousands of Chinese workers were illegally using tourist visas to enter the country and take Standard Gauge Railway jobs - which China had promised Nairobi - from Kenyans.\n\n\"Insiders said besides the official numbers that have applied for work permits, there are hundreds of others behind the walls working using tourist visas who fly back home every six months for a short break, before jetting back in to pick up where they left,\" the newspaper noted.\n\nThe track record of Chinese nationals evading the Kenyan immigration system suggests it is possible for many to avoid screening for coronavirus in the future.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

respiratory problems, though the virus has not yet been confirmed in any of the patients.\n\nThese suspected cases are unlikely to be isolated, with Professor Haas saying that there may be more cases

'Porous Borders' From Fatal Coronavirus", "body": "British citizens are being warned to avoid travelling to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, as airports in Britain have ramped up health screenings to prevent a possible outbreak in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe deadly outbreak of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, which has killed 17 people and has possibly infected thousands, with cases being reported in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, and the United States, has prompted the UK Foreign Office to ramp up security measures.\n\nOn its website, the Foreign Office said that although there are currently no confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, it will increase health screenings at London's Heathrow Airport, which receives three direct flights from Wuhan every week.\n\n\"In light of the latest medical information, including reports of some person-to-person transmission, and the Chinese authorities' own advice, we are now advising against all but essential travel to Wuhan\", said a Foreign Office spokesperson.\n\nUnderscoring the problem of preventing the spread of the virus, Prof Neil Ferguson, Director of the Medical Research Council's Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said that it will be difficult for authorities to spot those infected as there is a five day incubation period in which those affected by the disease will display no symptoms.\n\n\"This sort of measure of trying to identify people who are sick coming off a plane will only identify, if you're lucky, people who will have fever coming off a plane\", told The Telegraph.\n\n\"If somebody was infected two days before they travelled, they will arrive without any symptoms at all. It's understandable countries want to try and reduce the threat by various measures at the border. But the border will still be porous\", Ferguson warned.\n\nIn response to the rising epidemic, the Chinese government has quarantined Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, shutting down airports and train stations for outbound passengers as well as suspending local transport services. Citizens and government employees are now required to wear face masks, as panic has spread throughout the city.\n\n\"When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little too late now. The government's measures are not enough\", a Wuhan primary school teacher told The Guardian.\n\n\"Infected people could be right beside you and you wouldn't know. That is what is scarier\", she added.\n\nThe deadly virus was first discovered in humans in December, however, was only identified as a coronavirus this month. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has said that the virus originated in a seafood market that \"conducted illegal transactions of wild animals\". The market has since been shut down, according to the BBC.\n\nThe disease which affects the respiratory systems of those affected is a similar strain to the SARS virus that killed nearly 800 people in the early 2000s.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kurt_zindulka@breitbart.com", "name": "Kurt Zindulka", "type": "author",

of Wuhan Virus in Environmentalist's Death", "body": "The founder of China's oldest environmental organization and his wife died of \"severe lung disease\" amid the spread of a novel virus that causes pneumonia, but tested neither of them for the virus and failed to isolate any potential contacts, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe \"Wuhan virus,\" a coronavirus mutation that originated in the city of Wuhan and Chinese authorities only identified on Monday, has infected nearly 600 people and killed 17, according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates on Thursday. Scientists believe it originated in a wild game and seafood market and have matched the genome to viruses active in snakes common to the region in central China. The virus causes respiratory illness and triggers pneumonia.\n\nThe Communist Party announced it would cancel all flights out of Wuhan and curtail public transportation in Wuhan and four neighboring cities late Wednesday to prevent people from spreading the virus. The limitations come shortly before the Lunar New Year, during eastern Asia's busiest travel season. The measures did not prevent the virus from spreading internationally, however; Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, and the United States have all documented cases, most of them individuals from Wuhan.\n\nBeijing has conceded that the number of patients who did not have contact with the original source of the virus is growing, meaning person-to-person contact is possible and increasingly common.\n\nNo health authorities have identified Xu Dapeng, the founder of the oldest environmentalist NGO in China Friends of Nature, as a Wuhan virus carrier. According to RFA, the Chinese government confirmed his death on Wednesday, but attributed it to \"pneumonia.\" His wife, who RFA does not name, died of a similar illness ten days before Xu, which would place the date of her infection before China announced it had identified the virus.\n\nBoth died in Wuhan.\n\nAccording to sources close to the couple who spoke with RFA, the hospital did not test either patient for the virus and has done nothing to isolate potential contacts, even those who have come forward and requested quarantine.\n\n\"A group member surnamed Zeng confirmed the news to RFA, saying Xu's remains had been cremated almost immediately after his death,\" RFA reported. \"A friend of Xu's who gave only his surname Liu said neither Xu nor his wife had been tested for the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that has killed 17 people in Wuhan, and that the couple's daughter hadn't been placed in isolation.\"\n\n\"When she took her father to the hospital yesterday afternoon [Jan. 22], the hospital wouldn't take him,\" Liu reportedly told RFA. \"Her father died last night, and she thought that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would help her, but that didn't happen. The authorities didn't care about it at all, and the doctors were no longer bothering with her.\"\n\nThe sources noted that the deaths will soon result in a funeral gathering which could spread the virus further. Xu's daughter appears not to have obvious symptoms of infection, but given the little information available about the virus's behavior, this does not discount the possibility of her being a carrier.\n\nRFA confirmed with Wuhan's disease control center that they were rejected individuals who requested isolation or testing for the virus based on observed symptoms and only taking in those approved by health officials at other hospitals, which are controlled by the communist regime.\n\nFriends of Nature dedicates itself to raising awareness for environmental protection and advocating for protecting endangered species and against pollution. Chinese state media has noted the group in the past for its work in opposing government infrastructure projects that could harm endangered species, placing it at odds with the authoritarian communist regime.\n\nChina is the world's biggest polluter, responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than any other country and 73 percent of the garbage dumped into the Atlantic Ocean. Beijing is also responsible for an outsized amount of global plastic waste and dedicated to building fossil fuel projects around the country that harm locals' air quality. A group protesting China on environmental grounds - particularly given the fate of protests against dictator Xi Jinping from Maoist student groups, factory workers, and alarmed parents - poses a threat to the stability of the regime.\n\nChinese officials have already used the virus to silence individuals on social media. On Tuesday, Wuhan police revealed that they had \"handled\" eight individuals for posting \"rumors\" about the virus on social media, threatening to \"handle\" others who did the same.\n\n\"Anyone posting information and comments online should abide by [China's] laws and regulations,\" police said in a statement. \"The police will investigate and punish anyone fabricating and spreading rumors and disrupting social order.\"\n\nThe police department did not elaborate on how they \"handled\" or \"punished\" the unnamed individuals, or if those individuals remained in police custody at the time of the statement.\n\nIn addition to raising concerns about Beijing using the virus to silence dissent, Xu's death suggests that China is deliberately failing to document viral cases to hide the true scope of the disease's range. The Epoch Times, a newspaper often critical of the communist regime, noted on Wednesday that official government channels have contradicted themselves on the number of cases documented nationally on multiple occasions.\n\nOn Wednesday, for example, the National Health Commission announced 440 documented coronavirus patients nationwide while the national television network claimed 444 confirmed cases in Hubei, the province for which Wuhan serves as capital, alone. Similarly, the official tally out of Huanggang, one of the isolated cities, was 109 cases, compared to the 12 Chinese state television claimed there were.\n\nShocking videos posted by dissidents online and allegedly from a hospital in Wuhan showed unattended patients collapsed in a hallway, suggesting a lack of care on the part of health officials.\n\nVirologists are warning that the exponential growth of the number of cases identified per day suggests that the virus is highly contagious.\n\n\"My conservative estimate is that this epidemic could end up at least 10 times the scale of SARS [severe acute respiratory disease],\"\n\nGuan Yi, director of the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases at Hong Kong University, told China's Caixin magazine, according to the South China Morning Post. Guan argued that the Chinese regime moved too late to isolate Wuhan. The Post noted that nearly 300,000 people left Wuhan on Wednesday before the official lockdown notice on trains.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"},

The health district in the community located northwest of Houston reports they have the patient isolated in his home during testing.\n\nBrazos County Health Authority spokesman Dr. Eric Wilke said the patient is a student at Texas A&M University. The spokesman said the patient exhibited minor symptoms and was examined at an emergency room in the Bryan-College Station area. It is not known at this time what airport the student entered the U.S. through.\n\nTexas A&M officials posted:\n\nEarlier today, Texas A&M University was notified by the Brazos County Health District that a student may have a possible case of novel coronavirus.\n\nTexas A&M continues to work with its Student Health Services and the Brazos County Health District. Officials have described the immediate health risk to the campus community as low.\n\nStudents who have questions or concerns, can contact A&M's Student Health Services at info@shs.tamu.edu or on its Facebook page.\n\nGuidance on the virus is available on the Centers for Disease Control website.\n\nDr. Wilke said the patient is self-isolating but would not say if the student is in a home, apartment, or dormitory. He said is is operating under the assumption that the student, age 20-30, attended classes prior to presenting at a local hospital with symptoms.\n\nHe said the patient went to the hospital out of concern and not because of the severity of the illness.\n\nWilke would not confirm the patient's travel timeline but said he entered the U.S. before screening began earlier this week.\n\nTesting will be accomplished and completed \"as soon as feasible.\" The sample is in transport to CDC labs in Atlanta, Georgia. Results are expected within 24 hours.\n\n\"We are doing routine monitoring with the patient,\" the spokesman said. \"Texas A&M is safe to attend. They are monitoring the situation as well.\"\n\n\"His symptoms are not severe and he is doing well,\" Wilke confirmed. \"We assess the situation as being a low risk for the campus.\"\n\nHealth officials are investigating the travel timeline and what contact the student may have had with others after returning to the U.S. He has been in the U.S. for several days before presenting with symptoms.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_price@breitbart.com", "name": "Bob Price", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas A&M University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazos_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazos County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brazos County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBTX-TV", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KBTX-TV"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bryan, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormitory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dormitory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Community_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Community Health", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 29}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/AP_20009119424109.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5454192", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 12}, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 12, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1424095070", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": true, "date": "2020-01-26", "time": "15:11:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-26T15:11:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-26T15:10:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/01/26/canada-confirms-first-case-of-wuhan-coronavirus/", "title": "Canada Confirms First Case of Wuhan Coronavirus", "body": "TORONTO (AP) - A Toronto hospital said Saturday it has a confirmed case of the deadly virus from China, Canada's first.\n\nSunnybrook Health Sciences Centre said it is \"caring for a patient who has a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.\"\n\nOfficials said the man is his 50s and recently flew from Wuhan, China to Guangzhou, China and then on to Toronto on Jan. 23.\n\n\"He really wasn't in Toronto very long.

The illness will officially be fully confirmed once it completes that testing.\n\nDr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, said they are 95% sure it is the virus.\n\n\"This is the first presumptive confirmed case,\" said Williams. \"While we are convinced our tests do demonstrate positivity there is confirmation at the national medical laboratory in Winnipeg and once that is done is is a fully confirmed case.\"\n\nThe man is now in stable condition in isolation.

from Joining Global Wuhan Virus Response", "body": "Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to reconsider membership for Taiwan, which has long been blocked by Beijing, in light of the virus epidemic spreading from Wuhan.\n\nChina's efforts to isolate and marginalize Taiwan continue unabated, including provocative aerial maneuvers that are keeping Taiwan's defense forces on high alert throughout the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\n\"Political considerations should not surpass protection for the people,\" President Tsai said on Wednesday. \"I want to again urge the WHO not to exclude Taiwan for political reasons. Taiwan is on the front line of global infectious disease prevention. The WHO should have a space for Taiwan's participation.\"\n\nTaiwan reported its first confirmed case of the Wuhan virus on Tuesday. The patient is a Taiwanese businesswoman who was hospitalized after returning from a working trip to Wuhan. Taiwan banned visitors from Wuhan and nearby Chinese cities on Wednesday, followed by the cancellation of all direct flights between Taiwan and Wuhan on Thursday.\n\nU.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) on Thursday supported Tsai's call for Taiwanese membership in WHO, viewing the Wuhan virus as an example of how Chinese obstructionism may have already put lives at risk.\n\nCotton added that the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) continuing efforts to block Taiwanese membership in WHO during an international health crisis \"show yet again that Beijing is a malign actor on the world stage.\"\n\n\"Let's hope their vindictive behavior doesn't raise the death toll any higher,\" he said.\n\nChina has been keeping Taiwan from attending WHO meetings since President Tsai's election in 2016. Beijing portrays Tsai as a dangerous \"secessionist\" whose election (and now re-election) made it necessary to aggressively isolate the country. The Chinese view Taiwan as a semi-autonomous province that will inevitably rejoin the motherland, by force if necessary.\n\n\"We don't have a need to declare ourselves an independent state. We are an independent country already and we call ourselves the Republic of China, Taiwan,\" Tsai told the BBC after she was re-elected in a landslide this month. She argued her sweeping electoral victory demonstrates the Taiwanese people have little interest in China's \"One Country, Two Systems\" arrangement, which they see as a disastrous failure in Hong Kong.\n\nChina is especially keen to prevent Taiwan from joining any organization with connotations of independent national status, including agencies such as WHO and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), where Taiwan's exclusion endangers civilian lives. Keeping Taiwan out of WHO prevents the Taiwanese from receiving vital information about health crises such as the Wuah virus as quickly as possible.\n\nCotton is one of a growing number of voices blaming the Chinese Communist Party for the spread of the Wuhan virus, which could be much more contagious and dangerous than the CCP initially wanted to admit.\n\nChinese citizens themselves widely believe government secrecy and censorship are putting their lives in danger, noting that people have been arrested for trying to warn others about the emergence of the coronavirus, which the Chinese government falsely portrayed as unlikely to pass from human to human. The Chinese public was only told the Wuhan virus is communicable, and advised to wear masks to reduce the danger, two days ago.\n\nA grim running joke on Chinese social media describes the Wuhan bug as a \"patriotic\" disease because, according to government reports nobody believes, it only infected people in one Chinese province before packing its bags and heading overseas to infect Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and the United States.\n\nThe World Health Organization has been officially grateful for Chinese cooperation on the Wuhan virus so far. WHO is still debating whether to declare a rare Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for the outbreak.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Deploys Military to Fight Coronavirus as Infections Approach 1,000", "body": "China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) will deploy to central Wuhan, the metropolis where a previously unidentified coronavirus that has killed at least 26 people originated, to help build medical facilities to fight the virus, the Communist Party confirmed on Friday.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed 902 cases of the Wuhan virus worldwide, the overwhelming majority of them in China. All 26 deaths also occurred in China. Health authorities have isolated confirmed cases of the virus throughout Asia - in Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau - as well as Italy and the United States. The international cases are all Wuhan residents abroad or locals who recently visited Wuhan.\n\nThe People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, noted that the number of suspected cases surpassed 1,000 as of Friday.\n\nThose numbers may be significantly deflated, however, as reports surface from Wuhan and elsewhere in China of doctors refusing to test individuals suffering from and dying of pneumonia, which the virus is known to cause. Individuals who suspect they may be carrying the coronavirus have revealed anonymously that Wuhan hospitals have turned them away when requesting testing.\n\nCoronavirus is a family of viruses that includes the one responsible for the 2003 outbreak of Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people. The Communist Party's refusal to act to publicly contain the virus and repeated denials of the scale of the contagion contributed significantly to the high death toll.\n\nFor this outbreak, the Communist Party has insisted that it has been diligent and transparent in combatting the public health threat since identifying the virus and sharing the genome sequence with global scientists on Monday.\n\n\"Acting with openness, transparency and a high sense of responsibility to global health security, Chinese authorities will continue to share information of the epidemic with the WHO [World Health Organization], relevant nations and China's Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions in a timely manner,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Thursday. \"We believe the WHO Emergency Committee will have fair, fact-based and reasonable evaluation and judgment on the situation.\"\n\nReports indicate that Wuhan residents and doctors were aware of a spreading respiratory infection in December and that Chinese authorities underplayed the virus's potential to spread to health professionals, who subsequently contracted the disease.\n\nOn Friday, the Chinese state propaganda outlet Global Times confirmed the deployment of troops to Wuhan to help health workers contain and treat patients.\n\n\"The Chinese military are being deployed to help control Wuhan Coronavirus. 40 medical personnel of troops in Wuhan have been dispatched to a civilian hospital,\" the newspaper announced. The South China Morning Post specified that the military will be helping Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital's intensive care unit treat patients and organize its treatment centers.\n\nSoldiers will also presumably help keep Wuhan and the other seven impacted cities on lockdown amid reports that Chinese people from the epicenter of the outbreak have used fever-reducing medicines to thwart temperature checks. China has canceled nearly every major Lunar New Year festivity and shut down major tourist attractions like parts of the Great Wall, Beijing's Forbidden City, and Shanghai Disneyland.\n\nThe PLA will also likely help Wuhan police silence any unauthorized anti-communist speech. Wuhan police threatened individuals this week to limit their public discussion of the virus, announcing they had \"handled\" eight individuals for unauthorized speech. They did not elaborate on what \"handling\" the people affected meant.\n\nThe military is arriving in Wuhan as reports grow of Wuhan health officials, blindsided by the virus, increasingly being infected with it. China claims only 15 health workers have contracted the virus - 14 of them allegedly from the same patient - after initially insisting no evidence suggested the virus could jump from person to person and only those exposed to the animal carrier of the new virus could contract it. Anonymous health workers told the South China Morning Post they believe Beijing is not reporting all cases of health workers carrying the virus and refusing to test many who show clear symptoms of being infected.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com", "name": "Frances Martel", "type": "author",

Economy | Breitbart", "body": "The outbreak of a new respiratory virus in China is likely damaging for a Chinese economy struggling to bounce back after experiencing its slowest growth in decades.\n\nThe extent of the economic drag from the coronavirus will not be known for some time but analysts are looking at the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, for clues-and many are concluding that the impact of this year's outbreak could be worse.\n\nThe timing of the outbreak is particularly inauspicious. China is just days away from Lundar New Year celebrations, a time when millions of Chinese typically travel to their familial hometowns, gather for parades, eat out, go to the movies, and shop. Last year, Chinese people spent around $150 billion on restaurants and shopping over the week-long holiday, according to official figures. Spending on domestic travel and tourism for the holiday was around $118 billion.\n\nThat raises the possibility of the virus spreading quickly. This could be avoided through travel restrictions and consumer decisions to stay home but at a potentially very high economic cost. During 2003 epidemic, growth in retail sales plummeted by about half.\n\nChina's consumer spending and services sector are now much bigger, which in most circumstances is a good thing. But it makes the country far more vulnerable to a downturn in consumer spending. And travel and tourism account for 5 percent of GDP, up from around 2 percent in 2003.\n\n\"China's economy is therefore more exposed now than when SARS hit. The key will be how quickly authorities are able to bring the infection's spread under control,\" Nathaniel Taplin wrote recently in the Wall Street Journal's influential \"Heard on the Street\" column.\n\nGlobal oil prices have fallen on concerns that the virus could dampen demand. Analysts at Goldman Sachs have forecast the outbreak lowering demand for oil by around 300,000 barrels a day, worth about $3 off the global price, according to the Financial Times.\n\nChina is also more urbanized than it was in 2003-and dependent on the spending of urban households. That makes it easier for the virus to spread and could heighten the economic impact.\n\nIf Chinese consumers decide to shelter in place, the effects would likely be felt beyond China's borders, diminishing demand for foreign goods at a politically sensitive time when China is attempting to ramp up its purchases of U.S. products.\n\nThe good news is that Chinese authorities, after initially being slow to react, now seem to be taking the threat from the virus seriously. It also appears to be less virulent than SARS, although that could change as the virus mutates.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"title": "First Europe Coronavirus Cases as Beijing Locks Down 56 Million People", "body": "Three cases of the deadly Chinese Coronavirus have been confirmed in France, the first in Europe, as the Chinese government moves to lockdown whole cities impacted by the disease, where an estimated 56 million people are now subjected to travel restrictions.\n\nThe first cases in Europe have been confirmed in France, where a man who travelled from China on Wednesday was diagnosed and is receiving treatment in the city of Bordeaux, and two other individuals are being treated a separate case in Paris. Those two also came to France from China recently and are members of the same family.\n\nFrance has the first cases because its doctors are better equipped to detect the virus than their counterparts in other European nations, health minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said in a strangely dark boast Friday. The comments also imply Coronavirus carrying individuals are already present in other European nations but have yet to be detected.\n\nThese developments come as the second confirmed case of Coronavirus was reported in the United States. Others have been observed in Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and Nepal.\n\nOn Friday, the British health secretary Matt Hancock warned it was \"increasingly likely\" there would be Coronavirus cases in the UK, noting that university towns with large populations of Chinese university students were most at rist.\n\nThe official Chinese government death toll presently stands at 41, with 1,287 infected, with 237 of those in critical condition. Those official numbers may be questioned, with British newspaper The Daily Telegraph noting both concerns of a coverup by authorities, and of civil liberties abuses stemming from the extraordinary scale of the lockdown being imposed by the Chinese government.\n\nIn addition to the quarantine imposed on the city of Wuhan itself where the virus originated, at least 17 other cities are experiencing major travel restrictions, meaning 56 million people -- equivalent to the entire population of England -- have been placed on lockdown by the Chinese government. Difficult to substantiate claims from inside Wuhan itself state locals knew of the spread of the Coronavirus last year, weeks before the Chinese government admitted there was a problem or started to take action.\n\nChinese police have, however, \"handled\" individuals who spoke about the virus on social media. It is not clear what being \"handled\" by Chinese police in this context actually means for the individuals involved.\n\nWhile the Coronavirus has caught headlines worldwide, the World Health Organisation has not declared it a global emergency, noting earlier this week it is instead \"an emergency in China\". By way of contrast, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control notes this winter, 15 million people in the United States were infected with flu, 140,000 of them hospitalised, and 8,200 deaths.\n\nThe approximately 8,200 deaths in the U.S. linked to flu figure comes in a season where deaths have actually fallen, are below epidemic levels, and hospitalisations are at historically normal levels, putting the present spread of Coronavirus so far in areas like the U.S. and Europe into some perspective.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":

Outbreak, China Tried to Hold World's Largest Banquet", "body": "The outbreak of the Wuhan virus has become a major political problem for China's dictator Xi Jinping as accusations of bureaucratic paralysis, reckless policies, and dangerous secrecy fly within China and around the world.\n\nOn Thursday, the mayor of Wuhan noted that a huge banquet with over 130,000 guests was held on Sunday, days before the Chinese government suddenly reversed course and quarantined the city.\n\nChannel News Asia noted Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang has been criticized for handling the virus outbreak badly. He responded by complaining that he and other local officials were not given adequate warning, so they proceeded with events such as a massive banquet in the Baibuting district of Wuhan.\n\n\"The reason why the Baibuting community continued to host the Banquet this year was based on the previous judgment that the spread of the epidemic was limited to humans, so there was not enough warning,\" Zhou said, evidently meaning that early assessments said the Wuhan virus was not spread by human contact.\n\nThe banquet in question was a jaunty event presented as an early celebration of Lunar New Year, which begins this weekend. The annual banquet, now in its 20th year, allegedly featured almost fourteen thousand different dishes prepared by attendees and sponsors, a feat organizers hoped would set a world record for most dishes served at a single meal. Smaller versions of the Baibuting banquet in previous years set Guinness records.\n\n\"Having a big event like this at a time of an epidemic amounts to a lack of basic common sense,\" Shanghai respiratory disease specialist Li Xinzhou remarked dryly to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday.\n\nThe Journal noted that some of China's top epidemiologists arrived in Wuhan on the same day the banquet was held and made the determination that the coronavirus was indeed spreading from humans to humans, instead of being spread entirely by animals as previously believed. In fact, they determined a single Wuhan virus patient was able to infect over a dozen medical staff. While they were reaching this conclusion, thousands of people were sitting shoulder-to-shoulder at the Baibuting banquet and feasting on a wide variety of meats.\n\n\"People close to the Wuhan government, including advisers and business executives with which it consults, said officials remained overly optimistic that the outbreak would be contained while they focused on other priorities, including annual Communist Party meetings there,\" the Journal wrote.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name": "John Hayward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Xianwang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zhou Xianwang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zhou dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paralysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guinness World Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xinzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Xinzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of China"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/banquet-china.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 6}, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 6, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1424314555", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-26", "time": "20:31:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-26T20:31:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-26T20:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4039215743541718, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/border/2020/01/26/china-coronavirus-could-spread-two-weeks-before-symptoms-show/", "title": "CHINA: Coronavirus Could Spread Two Weeks Before Symptoms Show", "body": "A Chinese health official reports the Wuhan novel coronavirus could be contagious for up to two weeks before a patient becomes symptomatic. This means people who are not yet showing symptoms of coronavirus-related illness could be spreading the virus to other contacts.\n\nChina's National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei told reporters during a press briefing on Sunday said the incubation period for the novel coronavirus is one to 14 days, Reuters reported. In a shocking continuation, the health commissioner said the virus is contagious during the incubation period -- before patients exhibit symptoms of illness.\n\nThis is a dramatic difference from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 and 2003 when only patients exhibiting symptoms could spread the disease.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, an advisor to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN, \"This is a game changer.\"\n\nHe said this makes containing the spread of the virus much more difficult when a patient can be spreading the virus for up to two weeks without knowing they have contracted the virus.\n\n\"It means the infection is much more contagious than we originally thought,\" Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, explained. \"This is worse than we anticipated.\"\n\nOther health officials in the U.S. expressed doubt about the Chinese health commissioner's analysis, CNN stated.\n\nAnother CDC advisor, Dr. Paul Offitt told CNN that given Ma's statement, health officials should \"cast a wider net\" in an effort to alert potentially infected patients.\n\nThis makes the coronavirus more like the flu than SARS or even ebola, BBC Health and Science Correspondent Jame Gallagher reported.\n\n\"People with Sars (the last deadly coronavirus outbreak to hit China) and Ebola are contagious only when symptoms appear,\" Gallagher wrote. \"Flu, however, is the most famous example of a virus that you spread before you even know you're ill.\"\n\nHe cautioned we are not yet at the point where officials are saying this could be a global pandemic like the swine flu, but stopping \"symptomless spreaders\" will make containing the spread of the virus much more difficult.\n\nCommissioner Ma also said the virus, which has now infected more than 2,000 people globally and killed 56 in China, is getting stronger in its ability to to move from one person to another. He said infections could continue to rise despite his country's strong efforts to contain it.\n\nMa expressed their knowledge of the virus is still very limited and the risk of possible mutations is unclear.\n\nIn the latest step to contain the spread of the coronavirus, Chinese officials stopped the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms nationwide, Reuters reported.\n\nOn Sunday, California health officials announced two confirmed coronavirus cases bringing the U.S. total to four, CNN reported.\n\n\"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified Orange County health officials Saturday that a potential case of coronavirus tested positive, while Los Angeles County Department of Public Health announced Sunday that the CDC had confirmed

"body": "Pro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong protested against the city's Beijing-controlled government on Thursday over its inadequate response to the Chinese coronavirus.\n\nAt a press briefing at the Legislative Council this afternoon, lawmakers all wearing surgical masks demanded the government halt all flights and high-speed rail journeys from the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated.\n\nThe lawmakers called for the immediate quarantine of anyone arriving from Wuhan and identification of the health status of those entering Hong Kong from elsewhere. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced an expansion of the government's power to isolate or quarantine individuals from the general public if they are deemed a public health hazard this month before China announced it had identified the never-before-seen virus.\n\nTwo people in the region have tested positive for the disease, posing a potentially major risk to protests and any other form of organized activities that are often a hotbed for mass contagion.\n\n\"If we don't do anything at the border, we're actually inviting the disease to come,\" Civic Party lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki told reporters at the protest. \"What we're asking for is border controls as a means of quarantine; it's not to stop people from coming to Hong Kong, but we need to have a health declaration form.\"\n\nDemocrat Party lawmaker Helena Wong described the government's response as \"unacceptable,\" accusing the authorities of failing to learn the lessons of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that killed nearly 300 people in 2003.\n\n\"We can't see this government taking responsibility to protect the health and safety of its people,\" she said. \"They are too scared to offend the mainland, but not too scared to offend Hongkongers.\"\n\nShowing little sign of concern about the outbreak, around 8,000 people reportedly attended another pro-democracy rally on Wednesday evening organized by lawmaker Shiu Ka-Chun to show solidarity with those inside the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre, a maximum-security institution for detainees and judgment respited prisoners.\n\nThe event had been approved by police, although Shiu claimed that officers had threatened to use tear gas if protesters blocked any of the surrounding area. The Correctional Services Department put barriers up outside the facility to stop protesters from gaining access to the building.\n\n\"Support our brothers and sisters until the end!\" protesters were heard chanting. \"Release the righteous! Give us back justice!\" Another chant went, \"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times! Five demands, not one less!\"\n\nVarious speakers were invited to address the crowd, including one who had previously been detained in the facility. He described conditions inside the center as filled with rats and cockroaches, adding that the food was regularly served raw.\n\n\"They could have cooked it well, but they chose to give us raw food,\" he told the crowd. \"They can try to kill us all. But as long as there is one of us left, we will keep fighting.\"\n\nAt one point, the crowd sang \"Happy Birthday\" after learning that it was one of the inmate's birthday, as well as the popular protest song \"Glory to Hong Kong.\"\n\nPolitical tensions in Hong Kong remain sky-high as a result of the ongoing pro-democracy demonstrations, which show no sign of abating ten months after they began. The protests initially broke out as a reaction to a proposed extradition bill by Hong Kong's pro-China CEO Lam that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to China for trial.\n\nThe movement has since morphed into a wider resistance against Beijing's increasing interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs, undermining the \"One Country, Two Systems\" agreement signed with the British Empire following its handover in 1997. Protest leaders have laid out a series of demands, including an investigation into police brutality, the release of all political prisoners, and reforms to their voting system that would allow them to directly elect their leader.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_kew@breitbart.com", "name": "Ben Kew", "type": "author",

Coronavirus Case Confirmed in U.S.  --  60 Suspected Across Nation", "body": "The Centers for Disease Control confirmed a second U.S. case involving the novel coronavirus affecting a 60-year-old woman from Chicago who recently returned from Wuhan, China.\n\nA Chicago woman returned from Wuhan on January 13 and became symptomatic several days later, the Chicago Tribune reported Friday. The woman traveled to the city that is now the epicenter for the outbreak that has left 26 people dead and at least 830 infected. She went to China to care for her sick father.\n\nChicago Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady told the local newspaper the woman is still hospitalized but is stable and is \"clinically doing well.\" She spent more than two weeks in Wuhan.\n\nThe patient in a hospital in Washington state, a 30-year-old man, also contracted the coronavirus after traveling to the same region in China. He became the first confirmed coronavirus case in the U.S. earlier this week.\n\nThe Chicago woman was reportedly not symptomatic during her return flight from China, Dr. Arwady disclosed. She began to feel ill a few days later and called her doctor. The doctor referred her to a hospital that began treatment and testing. The CDC confirmed the illness is from the Wuhan 2019-nCoV coronavirus.\n\nOfficials report 63 other cases are under investigation to determine if they are connected to the coronavirus, according to Fox News. Those cases are spread out across 22 U.S. states.\n\nHealth officials call the situation a \"serious public health threat\" but said the immediate risk to the general public is \"considered low at this time.\" The CDC reports that 11 of the 63 cases tested negative for the virus.\n\nAt least one case is located in Texas where a student at Texas A&M University is being isolated after becoming sick following his return from Wuhan, Breitbart News reported. Brazos County Health Authority officials told Breitbart on Friday that the student is \"recovering.\" While the agency does not expect test results until Monday, officials said, \"at this point, no news about their status is good news.\"\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services reports it is investigating a possible case after a patient reported traveling through Wuhan recently, according to WRAL. The patient is in isolation at Duke University Hospital.\n\n\"Although it is unlikely that this person was infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus, we are conducting testing out of an abundance of caution,\" State Epidemiologist Dr. Zack Moore told the local news outlet. \"If you haven't traveled to Wuhan in the past two weeks, your risk of infection with this virus is very low.\"\n\nElsewhere, health officials in Michigan report they are monitoring three potential coronavirus cases, Bridge (a non-profit Michigan news agency) reported. The three cases were initially reported in Washtenaw and Macomb Counties. Doctors said they expect test results to take several days.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_price@breitbart.com", "name": "Bob

It is expected that medical staff will accompany the passengers to conduct screening and provide medical care if necessary.
