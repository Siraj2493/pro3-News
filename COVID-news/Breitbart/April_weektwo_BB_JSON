Instead, Trump's financial disclosures show that his three family trusts each had investments in a $10.3 billion Dodge & Cox mutual fund that owns shares in Sanofi, the world's fifth-largest drugmaker by prescription sales. As of its latest disclosures, those holdings amount to just 3.3 percent of the fund's holdings.\n\nTrump's most recent financial disclosure forms lists holdings in the Dodge & Cox International Fund valued between $1,001 and $15,000. That means Trump holds a maximum stake in the mutual funds of $45,000, giving him an indirect interest in Sanofi of $1,485 at the most.\n\nHis \"financial interest\" in Sanofi, which has a market capitalization of nearly $58 billion, could be as low as $99.10.\n\nThis was originally reported by independent journalist Mike Cernovich on his website. Cernovich's figures are lower because it appears he was calculating the interest of a single trust rather than combining the three trusts as we have here.\n\nPlaquenil, the company's version of the drug, is not material to Sanofi's stock. It is generically available, not sold in the United States, and has been around since the 1950s.\n\nTrump's indirect interest in Sanofi pales compared with his indirect interest in practically every company in the world through his much larger holdings in basically every big company in the world through broad market index funds.\n\nMarketwatch reports:\n\nTrump has a small stake in basically every big company you can think of.\n\nIn each of the trusts, the biggest fund holding is just the broader SPDR S&P 500 ETF, in which Trump holds between $200,000 and $450,000, according to his financial-disclosure forms.\n\nSo one could say Trump has $22,000 or so invested in Microsoft, and nearly as much in Apple\n\nIt would be accurate to claim that Trump has an interest in the prosperity of businesses around the globe, especially American companies. But it is inaccurate to claim he has a particular interest in the bottom line of Sanofi. Like most diversified investors, Trump's stock portfolio benefits when the broad market rises and is not leveraged to the profits of one company.\n\nIn any case, it is certainly false to claim he directly owns a stake in the French drugmaker.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_carney@breitbart.com", "name": "John Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxychloroquine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydroxychloroquine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanofi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanofi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_&_Cox", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dodge & Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutual fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarketWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MarketWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Index fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portfolio (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Olivier-Douliery_AFP-via-Getty-Images.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5666639", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 39732, "pinterest": 11}, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 39743, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "6026562905", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-09", "time": "18:48:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-09T18:48:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-09T17:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2020/04/09/cbs-news-caught-broadcasting-fake-hospital-footage-second-time/", "title": "CBS News Plays Italy Hospital Footage  --  Again  --  for Report on U.S.", "body": "Far-left CBS has been caught broadcasting misleading hospital footage for a second time during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, on March 22, CBS News used deceptively-edited footage the first time. Breitbart News reported then that \"Far-left CBS News was caught red-handed using chaotic footage from an Italian hospital in a story about New York City hospitals.\"\n\n\"It was an editing mistake. We took immediate steps to remove it from all platforms and shows,\" CBS News explained unconvincingly at the time.\n\nThe establishment media's coronavirus agenda is as sociopathic as it is obvious: up the death count. Why else would the media be actively looking to discourage those suffering from the Chinese virus from taking perfectly safe (as long as it's in consultation with a doctor) anti-malaria drugs?\n\nSimply put, the more Americans who die, the more it hurts President Trump's 2020 reelection chances. And one way to mislead the American people into believing the death count is unnecessarily high is to air chaotic hospital footage from Italy -- a country with socialized medicine, by the way -- and tell us this is an American hospital.\n\nIn the case of the first CBS fake news broadcast, the Italian footage was used to exaggerate and misrepresent a New York hospital.\n\nOver the weekend, CBS News again used this video to mislead its viewers, this time while talking about a Philadelphia hospital:\n\nAs I mentioned in my earlier piece the first time CBS intentionally misled its viewers with this footage:\n\nAm I the only one who's noticed how these so-called \"mistakes\" only ever fall in one direction?\n\n...\n\nAm I saying the media are hoping for death and chaos? Am I saying the media care more about beating Trump in 2020 than they do American lives? You're goddamned right that what's I'm saying.\n\nAnd that's why these mistakes only ever fall one way: in favor of the fake news media's anti-Trump agenda.\n\nHas the media ever made a mistake in Trump's favor?\n\nNo. But you already knew that.\n\nLook at the legion of coronavirus lies we have already caught the establishment media spreading, and now we're supposed to believe this was just -- oopsies! -- an editing error.\n\nWhat's more, and let's never forget this... CBS was also caught lying when it spread the fake news that Trump told those suffering from the coronavirus to go to work.\n\nAfter CBS was busted using this footage the first time, CBS said it \"took immediate steps to remove [the clip] from all platforms and shows.\"\n\nAsk yourself this... Why is CBS News forced to use another country's B-roll to try to fool the American people into believing things are worse than they are?\n\nThe asking of the question answers the question... because CBS cannot get its hands on legitimate footage of U.S. hospital chaos.\n\nAnd don't for a minute believe that's due to a lack of trying.\n\nBut as we have seen over the past few weeks, although things are bad, they are nowhere near as bad as the media hoped. Everyone who has so far needed a ventilator has gotten one. Nearby hospitals have been able to handle any overflow, so our hospitals are not overwhelmed, not even in New York, and coronavirus patients are not stacked one upon the other.\n\nBut just don't call CBS News the enemy of the people.

Yet the rumors persist that, to make room for new patients in Wuhan's overcrowded hospitals, medical staff chose older patients less likely to survive the infection and shipped them to incinerators while they were still alive and conscious.\n\nRFA quoted a source \"close to the funeral industry\" identified only as Ma who said that he had heard reports of \"people restrained and forced into body bags when they were still moving.\"\n\n\"Some people are saying that ... there are video clips of screams coming from funeral homes, from inside the furnaces ... which tells us that some people were taken to the funeral homes while they were still alive,\" Ma added.\n\nMa also noted the existence of video testimony from an anonymous older woman who had been treated at a Wuhan hospital, presumably for Chinese coronavirus.\n\n\"One old lady was saying that they put one guy into ... a body bag when he wasn't even dead yet, and took him off to the crematorium because there was no way of saving him,\" Ma told RFA.\n\nVideo of an older woman speaking anonymously to a camera began circulating on social media in February in which she said she witnessed a patient next to her at a Wuhan hospital stuffed into a body bag while still alive.\n\n\"He's not dead, his feet and hands are still moving,\" the woman says, \"[They] wrapped him in a plastic body bag and zipped it up.\"\n\nAccording to New Tang Dynasty, a broadcaster affiliated with the persecuted Chinese Falun Gong movement, the woman spoke with a Wuhan accent, suggesting she was a native of the central Chinese city.\n\nThe Taiwanese outlet Taiwan News traced the origin of the video to a Chinese student group called \"Youth Production,\" who reportedly uploaded the video on February 24. Taiwan News noted that the woman claimed to have suffered from coronavirus symptoms but, as she was in her 60s, she did not suffer severe symptoms, unlike the man taken away, who she estimated was in his 70s.\n\n\"She said that the man was weak but was still breathing when medical workers 'bound his head' and then his hands and feet, which were 'still moving,'\" Taiwan News reported, noting that she also lamented that the hospital where she received care had no other treatments available for coronavirus patients besides oxygen. In the West, doctors have begun experimenting with several drug mixtures, one of which -- a combination of antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat lupus and malaria -- has generated optimism in American hospitals.\n\nThe woman said she felt older patients at the hospital were treated \"like dead dogs.\"\n\nNeither Taiwan News nor RFA could independently confirm the reports of Wuhan residents being burned alive.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party claims that, as of Tuesday, it has documented 82,718 cases of coronavirus nationwide and 3,335 deaths across the country. The vast majority of these, 3,212 deaths, were recorded in Hubei province. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei.\n\nMultiple reports citing sources in Wuhan's seven funeral homes dispute this claim, estimating that the real death toll in the city is as much as ten times higher than China's official nationwide death toll. Reports of hundreds of bodies cremated in some funeral homes began surfacing in February, at the height of the epidemic in the city. Government officials did not allow residents to pick up the remains of their relatives until late March, however, as the strict lockdown that saw government officials welding Wuhan residents in their homes was still ongoing.\n\nWhen the funeral homes opened to distributed ashes two weekends ago, witnesses estimated that some funeral homes were distributing as many as 5,000 sets of remains a day. Estimates as to the number of sets of remains distributed last week in Wuhan range from 30,000 to 46,000 people.\n\n\"There are suspicions that many people died in their homes without being diagnosed and, at first, there were no kits to do the test,\" an unnamed resident said in a report last week. \"Nobody in Wuhan believes the official numbers. The real one, only they know.\"\n\nMa, the funeral home source speaking to RFA in its report on Monday, said that Wuhan was cremating so many bodies at some point that some incinerators broke down, resulting in cremators placing multiple bodies in one incinerator at a time to keep up with the sheer amount of remains. The result has been several reported incidents of people receiving urns with ashes featuring items they do not recognize that clearly did not belong to their loved ones.\n\n\"A resident of Wuhan's Jiang'an district surnamed Liu said she had found a man's belt clasp in the urn she was given, supposedly containing her mother's ashes,\" RFA noted. \"And a resident of Hongshan district said he had found the remains of ceramic dental crown, denture or implant in the urn labeled with his father's name, even though his father had never had such a thing fitted.\"", "source": {"uri":

state media has been flooding Facebook and Instagram with undisclosed political ads blaming President Donald Trump for the Wuhan coronavirus. Facebook said in a statement that it was an \"error\" that the ads were not classified as political and is correcting them.\n\nThe Telegraph reports that Chinese state media has been posting undisclosed political ads to Facebook and Instagram in an attempt to downplay China's role in the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and blaming President Donald Trump. Three Chinese state media outlets, Xinhua, China Central Television, and the Global Times, have targeted ads towards users across the world in English, Chinese, and Arabic.\n\nThe ads have reportedly been seen millions of times and extol China's efforts to fight the coronavirus while downplaying the countries domestic outbreak. The articles portray President Trump as misguided and racist and suggest that the virus may have originated in the United States. \"[China] has taken stringent and forceful measures, and turned the tide on coronavirus,\" said one ad. Another states: \"Trump's disruption to China has severe consequences.\"\n\nAll of the ads initially ran without a political disclaimer which allowed them to hide information about who the ads were targeting and where they originated from. Several of the articles focused on President Trump's use of the term \"Chinese virus\" to describe the coronavirus while others highlighted statements from Chinese president Xi Jinping.\n\nThe Telegraph reached out to Facebook about the ads, the social media network stated that it was an error that the ads were not classified as political and has since corrected the issue. A spokesperson also stated that many of the ads are running in countries where Facebook requires no disclosure making it difficult to determine how much more propaganda may have gone unnoticed on the site.\n\nThe Facebook spokesperson told the Telegraph that it was choosing to label media outlets instead of banning them because it prefers greater transparency, adding that all Facebook's services

Center for Justice, which is heavily financed by George Soros, is advocating the use of drop boxes to deposit ballots on voting day this November as part of a suggested overhaul of the U.S. voting system due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWith other Soros-financed groups, the Brennan Center has been leading a campaign advocating a \"vote by mail\" system in the upcoming presidential election, citing fears that coronavirus makes it too dangerous to vote in person. Some of the groups are using the coronavirus crisis to push permanent changes to the way Americans vote.\n\nAnalysts have posited that such proposals help the Democratic Party. Republicans specifically fear the prospect of voter fraud, since mail-in voting would be harder to authenticate.\n\nNow Brennan has released a preliminary $2 billion budget that breaks down the costs of a implementing the organization's blueprint for voting reform during the pandemic. The blueprint that has been widely cited by news media as making a central argument for a universal vote-by-mail option, while Democrats have used Brennan's plan to push voter reform legislation.\n\nPart of Brennan's budget calls for jurisdictions to \"offer secure drop boxes in accessible locations for voters to drop off ballots directly.\"\n\nThe estimate allocates $82 million to $117 million for drop box purchase and installation and some $35 million to $47 million for operation and maintenance.\n\n\"Drop boxes must be equipped with adequate security measures, such as cameras,\" the budget states without providing more specifics about security for the boxes.\n\nThe plan doesn't delineate rules for where such drop boxes could be located. Already California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington use drop boxes statewide and have various locations set up that are not located at official in-person balloting stations.\n\nThe Brennan Center's plan calls for a \"universal vote-by-mail option for all voters.\" The budget estimates $54 million to $89 million for increased ballot printing and $413 million to $593 million for extra postage costs.\n\nTo alert the public about changes to the voting method, the Brennan Center wants a $252.1 million public education campaign which \"must include advertising in non-English languages.\"\n\nBrennan also wants $85.9 million to bolster online voter registration and it advocates implementing same-day registration. The Brennan blueprint allows for mail-in ballots to be processed prior to the close of polls on Election Day.\n\nThe document lobbies for polling place modification and preparation including \"same-day registration, real-time address updates, and provisional balloting for certain individuals.\" Brennan doesn't define which \"certain individuals\" should receive same-day registration.\n\nBrennan also advocates expanded early voting, with states offering at least two weeks of early in-person voting or a minimum of five days.\n\n\"This would be a massive undertaking but I think it's absolutely necessary to make sure that we are prepared to run our elections in November, and I think all the problems we have been having in primaries in the last few weeks is evidence we need to start now,\" said Lawrence Norden, the director of Election Reform at the Brennan Center and one of the report's authors.\n\nDemocrat Sens. Amy Klobuchar (MN) and Chris Coons (DE) cited the Brennan Center's coronavirus voting plan in a letter to House and Senate leaders, urging extra funding for the scheme. Klobuchar and Coons are among over a dozen Democrat senators who introduced a bill last month to allow for the widespread mail-in ballots, along with other updated voting measures for the upcoming presidential election. Democrat Reps. Suzan DelBene (WA), Earl Blumenauer (OR), and Jamie Raskin (MD) introduced a companion bill in the House.\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice, located at NYU School of Law, is heavily financed by Soros's Open Society Foundations and is the recipient of numerous Open Society grants.\n\nBreitbart News previously reported the Brennan Center was listed in leaked Open Society Foundations documents as receiving funds specifically earmarked for \"litigation to expand access to registration and improve ease of voting.\"\n\nAlongside the Brennan Center are a slew of progressive groups tied to Soros money that are working overtime to push mail-in voting.\n\nThe Soros-funded Brennan Center's mail-in ballot plan was weaponized by the Stand Up America activist group, which launched a nationwide program urging Americans to nudge Congress to fund the voting changes. The group's activities reportedly resulted in more than 19,000 calls to congressional offices in one day alone.\n\nStand Up America is funded by the Sixteen Thirty Fund, which is managed by the shadowy Arabella Advisors, a for-profit consultancy funded by far-left donors. The Soros-funded Democracy Alliance recommended that donors invest several million dollars into Sixteen Thirty Fund.\n\nThe massively Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which routinely partners with Brennan, has been pumping materials urging coronavirus voting legislation that pushes mail-in voting.\n\nSoros's Open Society Foundations donated $50 million to the ACLU. The Brennan Center has been the recipient of numerous grants from Soros's Open Society Foundations totaling over $7,466,000 from 2000 to 2010.\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of progressive groups are reportedly mounting a multimillion-dollar campaign to not only change the presidential election system to mail-in voting during coronavirus, but to keep the mail-in balloting as part of the permanent way Americans will vote in the future.\n\nThe other groups in the mail-in advocacy coalition include the National Association of Non-Partisan Reformers, Public Citizen, Common Cause, National Vote at Home Institute and the Center for Secure and Modern Elections.\n\nCommon Cause is funded by Soros's Open Society Foundations. So is Public Citizen.\n\nThe Center for Secure and Modern Elections is a project of the left-leaning New Venture Fund, which doesn't disclose its donors.\n\nThe National Vote at Home Institute is partnered with the Soros-funded League of Women Voters, as well as the Soros-funded Common Cause.\n\nThe National Association of Non-Partisan Reformers lists its founding organization members as including FairVote. FairVote is a project of the Soros-funded Center for Voting and Democracy.\n\nA recent Washington Post oped by election experts cited a study finding \"people who vote by mail are significantly more likely to make mistakes than those who vote in person... Of course, people who vote in person may make mistakes -- but they can more easily ask for help in correcting their ballots.\"\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

for Next Coronavirus Stimulus Bill", "body": "Increased abortion funding. Stimulus checks for illegals. Permanent housing guarantees. Mail-in voting for elections. Minimum wage hikes and more union access. The large-scale release of imprisoned criminals. An extensive national disease surveillance program.\n\nThese are just some of the far-left, Big Government proposals being peddled by influential progressive organizations for Democrats to include in the next round of emergency stimulus funding, which the groups say should be at least as large as the $2.2 trillion CARES Act.\n\nThe Center for American Progress (CAP), which functions as an idea factory for the Democratic Party, compiled its wish list for the next round of recovery legislation during the Chinese coronavirus crisis.\n\nReprising the repurposed progressive anthem of never letting a crisis go to waste, the CAP's list of recommendations for the next stimulus package clearly seeks to use the coronavirus crisis to achieve many longstanding progressive policy aims.\n\nThe CAP tells lawmakers that the pandemic \"requires Congress to significantly expand the measures included in the CARES Act and other COVID-19 packages to reflect the expected magnitude and duration of the disruption.\"\n\nThe CAP recommends the construction of a robust surveillance program, including the following (below are direct quotes from the CAP plan):\n\nCAP wants to use the pandemic to fundamentally transform the voting system, requiring all states to \"significantly expand vote-by-mail opportunities; implement at least 14 days of early voting; adopt online and same day voter registration.\"\n\nHere, CAP, which is funded by billionaire activist George Soros, joins a slew of other Soros-funded progressive groups seeking the expanded use of mail-in balloting for elections by citing fears that coronavirus makes it too dangerous to vote in person.\n\nRepublicans specifically fear the prospect of voter fraud, since mail-in voting would be harder to authenticate.\n\nStimulus payments in the next round of legislation must also include \"undocumented individuals and mixed-status families where even just one parent is filing their taxes with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number and the other parent and all children have an SSN,\" CAP writes.\n\nInstead of turning off extra unemployment insurance benefits after the coronavirus pandemic is over, CAP advocates that unemployment insurance \"and other stabilizers\" - ostensibly stimulus checks -- \"should be automatically tied to economic conditions, so that continuing and future crises don't require ad hoc action.\"\n\nThe next stimulus package must ensure that \"permanent stable housing must be connected to wraparound services or a continuum of care that is flexible and tailored to the individual or household's needs.\"\n\nCAP adds: \"In addition to permanent protections for renters to ensure that they aren't pushed out of housing once it is obtained, rental and deposit assistance must also be targeted to currently unhoused people to guarantee their successful transition into longstanding housing.\"\n\nFor the next stimulus bill, CAP wants those defined as essential workers to get paid minimum wages of at least $15 dollars and they must have the ability to join a union.\n\nProgressives have long pushed minimum wage hikes despite warnings that such proposals could lead to disastrous economic consequences.\n\nThe federal minimum wage hike is a progressive plan that in the past was marketed as a \"living wage.\" The living wage scheme, deployed in the past locally, has a history of hurting small businesses, negatively impacting local economies and decreasing employment opportunities for low income workers. Indeed, the living wage has monumentally failed during numerous high profile trials.\n\nCAP, in the meantime, wants to use any upcoming coronavirus legislation to \"protect and expand access to reproductive health care,\" singling out abortion.\n\nThe progressive group states:\n\nReproductive health care is essential health care. Congress must act to expand access to reproductive health services, including abortion and contraception, especially given the unknowns about how pregnancy intersects with the coronavirus.\n\nCAP joins other Soros-funded groups by advocating the release of \"low-risk and elderly incarcerated persons.\"\n\nIt also wants pandemic legislation to \"secure additional resources and funding for currently and formerly incarcerated persons.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Breitbart News reported the Soros-funded Brennan Center for Justice submitted a letter to the governors of all fifty states urging them to use executive action to \"release as many people as possible from incarceration\" due to coronavirus fears \"provided they do not pose serious public safety threats.\"\n\nThe letter cited concerns that the U.S. prison population could face greater risk of illness and death than the general public due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCAP's wish list for the next stimulus bill advocates for funding so \"limited English proficient\" patients can \"access care in their preferred language.\"\n\nThe pandemic legislation should also ensure \"enhance[d] funding for agencies' enforcement of civil rights and anti-discrimination protections,\" CAP argues.\n\nBesides the recommendation document, CAP President Neera Tanden was one of 14 signatories to a \"statement of principles\" by progressive groups urging Congressional leaders to ensure the government massively intervenes to stabilize the U.S. economy.\n\n\"It is clearer than ever that we need major government intervention to stabilize the economy and put us on a long-term path to resiliency,\" the progressive leaders wrote in their missive.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

NY", "body": "The number of people hospitalized across the United States as a result of the novel coronavirus illness (COVID-19) is reportedly only a fraction of what some health experts projected a few days ago.\n\nOn Monday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters that in his state alone, the epicenter of the viral outbreak in the United States, new coronavirus hospitalizations dropped by about 75 percent, from 1,427 four days ago to 358 on Sunday.\n\nHighlighting the drop in new hospitalizations in NY, the state hardest hit (131,239 cases; 4,758 deaths as of Monday) by the coronavirus, Alex Berenson, former New York Times reporter who has been following the U.S. outbreak closely, observed on Twitter on Monday: \"It's over, guys. It's already over.\"\n\nJim Malatras, an aide for Gov. Cuomo, reportedly indicated that projections are now showing that New York is unlikely to need 110,000 hospital beds, as previously thought.\n\nThe new forecasts show \"a much lower demand\" that stands in the estimated 20,000-30,000 range, Jesse McKinley, the New York Times bureau chief in the NY capital of Albany, wrote on Twitter on Monday.\n\nThat means the new projections for the number of hospital beds needed in NY are between about 70 and 80 percent lower than initially estimated.\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Cuomo acknowledged that the drop in hospitalizations in combination with other signs, like the fatalities remaining flat for the second day in a row and a drop in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, suggest a \"possible flattening of the curve.\"\n\nCiting the figures contained in the White House-touted models created by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, the Epoch Times noted on Sunday:\n\nWhile tens of thousands are hospitalized across the United States due to COVID-19, the numbers are a fraction of what experts predicted just a few days ago. The main reason appears to be that the [IHME] projections were already off the day they were released.\n\n...\n\nGiven that states with available data had a current hospitalization rate around 6 to 20 percent, if each of the no-data states had a rate of 20 percent, the hospitalizations for the whole country would add up to some 47,000 as of April 3 to 4.\n\nThe IHME model expected about 114,000 to 181,000 hospital beds would be needed nationwide on April 3, and roughly 120,000 to 430,000 on April 16.\n\nThat means the number of hospitalizations across the United States earlier this month was much less (at most about 40 percent of the forecasted figure) than the number predicted by the IHME model.\n\nAmid the ongoing pandemic, health officials are relying on computer modeling that takes known data and makes predictions to inform and drive the decisions of private businesses and governments across the world.\n\nStatistical models attempting to predict the impact of the Chinese coronavirus, including the ones created by IHME, rely, at least in part, on polluted data from the Chinese Communist Party, Breitbart News confirmed last Friday.\n\nA growing number of experts - including Vice President Mike Pence and members of the Whitehouse Coronavirus Task Force that he leads - have questioned the legitimacy of China's official coronavirus death toll and infection rate.\n\nAnonymous members of the U.S. intelligence community allegedly agree that China has been hiding the severity of the viral outbreak within its borders, under-reporting both total cases and fatalities linked to the disease, Bloomberg reported this week.\n\nThe IHME predictions for New York also reflected a discrepancy between the institute's forecasts and the actual number of hospitalizations.\n\nIHME predicted that NY would need 41,000 to 58,000 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients by April 1.\n\nEven by April 3, New York needed less than 16,000 hospital beds, the Epoch Times noted.\n\nThe IHME model only got its hospitalizations forecasts right for one state -- Missouri, the news outlet found.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

"title": "Nolte: CNN's Chris Cuomo Caught Selectively Editing Trump Comments", "body": "CNN's Chris Cuomo, a proven liar and unstable anti-Trump activist, was caught selectively editing Donald Trump to make it look as though the president did nothing during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAs you will see below, this is something Cuomo has done in the past.\n\nYou have to watch the full video from Tuesday night below; at the end of the clip, the Daily Wire's Ryan Saavedra includes Trump's full remarks, which make it clear the president was taking plenty of action while trying not to cause a premature and unnecessary panic:\n\nAnother important thing Trump did during this time, something even he didn't mention, was the formation of the Coronavirus Task Force as early as January 27.\n\nKeep in mind, Trump was doing all of this while congressional Democrats and their media allies, like Cuomo and CNNLOL, were not only obsessed with distracting the country over that phony impeachment, but hoping to extend impeachment into February and March with the calling of witnesses.\n\nCan you imagine?\n\nMeanwhile, whenever Chris Cuomo has his brother, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), on the air for a chat, he never asks why, as late as March 2, Gov. Cuomo used reassuring language similar to President Trump's when speaking of the coronavirus:\n\n\"Excuse our arrogance as New Yorkers -- I speak for the mayor also on this one -- we think we have the best health care system on the planet right here in New York,\" Mr. Cuomo said on March 2. \"So, when you're saying, what happened in other countries versus what happened here, we don't even think it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries.\"\n\nHow about that.\n\nWhat's more, crack \"journalist\" he is, Fredo Cuomo has never even asked his own colleague at CNNLOL, Anderson Copper, why Cooper told his audience as late as March 4 that they \"should be more concerned about the flu\" than the coronavirus.\n\n\"So if you're freaked out at all about the coronavirus, you should be more concerned about the flu,\" Cooper told his few remaining viewers,\" Cooper said.\n\nOh, and guess who was sitting right there while Cooper said that? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who meekly responded with the suggestion that the \"coronavirus may have a higher fatality rate than the flu does\" and then told everyone to get the flu shot because reasons: \"We have a vaccine for the flu. Half the country doesn't get it. Hopefully that will change because of this.\"\n\nIn other words, the coronavirus might be a good thing because it will encourage people to get a flu shot!\n\nOh, and by the way, Gupta was one of many liars in the corporate media who spread the proven lie about Trump rejecting a coronavirus test from the World Health Organization.\n\nOver the course of his embattled time at CNNLOL, the disgraced Fredo has mocked a rape victim for wanting to protect herself, openly encouraged violence at the hands of left-wing terrorists against his political enemies on the right, encouraged the doxing of private citizens, attempted to exacerbate tensions between police and protesters during the Baltimore riots (then was caught lying about it), and was caught in the recent past misleading his small viewing audience with deceptive edits.\n\nI would offer Cuomo my sincere thoughts and prayers for a full comeback from the coronavirus he's suffering from, but Cuomo rejects \"thoughts and prayers.\"\n\nCuomo still hasn't told us if he's taking any of these anti-malaria drugs Trump (and Gov. Cuomo) are touting.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_nolte@breitbart.com", "name": "John Nolte", "type": "author", "isAgency":

New York City Auctioned Off Ventilator Stockpile", "body": "A new report indicates that New York City auctioned off its emergency stockpile of 500 ventilators several years ago, thanks to budget cuts and attention to other priorities.\n\nThe story, reported by ProPublica on Monday, echoes a similar report by the Los Angeles Times last week about California's stockpile. In both cases, Republican leaders built up emergency supplies, which were later cut for budgetary reasons.\n\nIt is a reminder that the nation's struggle with coronavirus had bipartisan origins.\n\nThe similarities between the New York City and California cases are striking. The Times reported that then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, worried about recent pandemics in Asia, and noting the political fallout of Hurricane Katrina for President George W. Bush, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in ventilators, masks, and mobile hospitals.\n\nSimilarly, and at the same time, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg prepared a stockpile for use in case of a pandemic.\n\nProPublica notes:\n\nIn July 2006, with an aggressive and novel strain of the flu circulating in Asia and the Middle East, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg unveiled a sweeping pandemic preparedness plan.\n\nUsing computer models to calculate how a disease could spread rapidly through the city's five boroughs, experts concluded New York needed a substantial stockpile of both masks and ventilators. If the city confronted a pandemic on the scale of the 1918 Spanish flu, the experts found, it would face a \"projected shortfall of between 2,036 and 9,454 ventilators.\"\n\nThe city's department of health, working with the state, was to begin purchasing ventilators and to \"stockpile a supply of facemasks,\" according to the report. Shortly after it was released, Bloomberg held a pandemic planning summit with top federal officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, now the face of the national coronavirus response.\n\nIn the end, the alarming predictions failed to spur action. In the months that followed, the city acquired just 500 additional ventilators as the effort to create a larger stockpile fizzled amid budget cuts.\n\nEven those extra ventilators are long gone, the health department said on Sunday.

But as her previous efforts demonstrate, Pelosi's prescription to \"save\" the country might do irreparable harm to American democracy.\n\nIn addition to giveaways for climate change, labor unions and student loan forgiveness advocates, the bill contained several election-related measures that would fundamentally change the methods and security of the way our country votes.\n\nBuried on page 643 of the original bill was the \"American Coronavirus/COVID-19 Election Safety and Security\" or ACCESS Act. It included funds for states to conduct elections via mail-in ballots during a declared national emergency, and would permit voters to return absentee ballots by designating another person to return the ballot to the post office or other ballot drop-off location, including an election office.\n\nGiven public warnings to avoid public places and gatherings such as traditional polling stations, the push to expand mail-in balloting makes sense. But it is also true that mail-in ballots are highly susceptible to fraudulent interference and tampering. In fact, Donald Trump closed his press conference last Friday by stating his opposition to national mail-in balloting because \"I think a lot of people cheat.\"\n\nHere, the President enjoys broad agreement. Elections officials from all political stripes acknowledge that mail-in ballots are far more vulnerable to fraud. Stories of political operatives who routinely scam senior citizens out of their absentee ballots are so widespread that the term \"granny farming\" was coined. Even the New York Times, when reporting on suspicions of election fraud in North Carolina last year, noted that \"absentee ballots are especially susceptible to manipulation.\"\n\nAnd allowing third-party ballot delivery would do nothing to reduce that vulnerability. Recent history indicates it would make it worse.\n\nIn Texas, paid political operatives known as politiqueras run rampant in the Rio Grande Valley, collecting ballots and manipulating electoral outcomes. In Florida, an elderly man who was blind swore an affidavit that an operative scammed him out of his absentee ballot.\n\nIn fact, the concept of allowing a third party to deliver or submit a ballot on another's behalf is known by election workers as \"ballot harvesting.\" While it has only been legal in a single state for one election cycle, its impact has already been profound.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to legalize the practice, and it was practiced there during the 2018 midterm election cycle. Following huge gains by California Democrats in those elections, political operatives from both parties agreed that the Democrats' mastery of ballot harvesting led to seven GOP-held congressional districts flipping blue, including every seat in once reliably Republican Orange County. The provision on page 643 of Pelosi's ACCESS Act bill would have extended this practice nationwide.\n\nDemocrats have long argued that collection of ballots by third parties might make it easier for vulnerable populations to cast ballots. These \"vulnerable populations\" typically include those lacking transportation, senior citizens in nursing homes, and people with medical issues. Ironically, these same populations are the ones being told by health and government officials to stay home and avoid contact with the outside world due to their higher risk of COVID-19 infection.\n\nFinally, how accurate are each state's voter registration rolls? When the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Ohio's efforts to clean up its voter rolls in 2012, the court's opinion noted two Pew Center statistics: Twenty-four million voter registrations in the U.S. were either \"invalid or significantly inaccurate,\" and that \"2.75 million people are said to be registered to vote in more than one state.\"\n\nThe provisions expanding mail-in voting and allowing ballot harvesting were ultimately scrapped before the stimulus bill's final passage. But Speaker Pelosi's renewed calls for an expanded federal response to address the growing impact of the COVID-19 virus suggest she may try again. It is vital that whatever legislation Congress might pass to help save the country from the ravages of this virus not infect our democracy with a new disease of its own.", "source": {"uri":

The measure ultimately passed unanimously in the Senate, but it initially did not go without opposition, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) attempted to offer her own version of relief filled with a variety of liberal \"wish list\" items, including major changes to voting methods. While the speaker has signaled support for a bipartisan measure in the same mold as the last, she hinted last week that she is still going to pursue changes to voting methods.\n\n\"Vote-by-mail is essential to protecting the future of our democracy as we confront this public health crisis. There is no legitimate argument against enacting it,\" Pelosi said last week:\n\nThe GOP and Trump administration are gearing up for battle, condemning the left for attempting to use the coronavirus pandemic to push their greater political agendas related to voting methods in U.S. elections.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) is leading the Democrat effort, pushing a bill to provide vote-by-mail and expand early voting. She claims Democrats are getting \"more and more bipartisan support from secretaries of states across the country,\" according to Politico.\n\n\"In a worst case scenario communities may be facing the choice of either voting by mail or not voting at all,\" Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who is spearheading the effort alongside Klobuchar, said.\n\n\"We're already going in this direction and now we're in the middle of a pandemic and I think this is a very different time,\" he added.\n\nThe Phase 3 bill provided $400 million for election security grants, \"which can be used broadly, including to expand vote-by-mail options and early voting, as well as to clean polling facilities and conduct public education campaigns,\" as Politico reported.\n\nDemocrats, however, believe they need more:\n\nCiting the move by some Republicans to delay primaries amid coronavirus concerns, Klobuchar said that she is \"looking at that next package to get the funding included\" as well as some additional reforms, like removing state requirements that voters present an excuse to vote absentee.\n\n\"That's premature. Around the world we've had people in new democracies go to vote when their lives were at risk because the right to vote was so precious,\" Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) said, according to Politico. \"Most Americans would be very skeptical of significant changes in our ability to go cast a ballot in person, certainly at this point.\"\n\n\"States should run state's elections,\" Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) stated. \"Washington D.C. should not run the state's elections. So if a state determines that's the way it wants to go, a state should make that decision.\"\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-TX) took it a step further, stating bluntly that Democrats \"want the federal government to take over elections.\"\n\n\"Our Democratic friends want the federal government to take over elections, but historically those have been handled at the state level,\" Cornyn said, according to Politico.\n\nIf voters \"can go to the grocery store, they can go to the polls,\" he added.\n\nPresident Trump has also cast doubt on the idea of mail-in voting.\n\n\"I think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting,\" Trump said last week. \"I think people should vote with ID, with Voter ID.\"\n\nSeveral Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and her former campaign attorney Marc Elias, however, are continuing to use the pandemic to push major voter changes. Those include mail-in voting, curbside voting, and ballot harvesting:\n\nNonetheless, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has warned Democrats, Pelosi particularly, against \"taking

Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) reportedly said on Thursday that he has fantasized about holding up coronavirus disinfectant from Kentuckians to make Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) pass more Democrat measures.\n\nMalinowski, a Democrat representing New Jersey's seventh congressional district, said in a call that he would threaten McConnell by withholding Lysol for his constituents.\n\n\"Fun fact about Somerset County [New Jersey], we make 100 percent of the national supply of Lysol disinfectant,\" he said in a video obtained by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). \"I've thought about using with Mitch McConnell, like, 'Hey, we're going to hold up the Lysol for Kentucky until you pass her\" bill.\n\n\"I see some thumbs up, but that's a fantasy that I don't think, it's not going to work that way,\" Malinowski said.\n\nMalinowski's comments follow the Senate Majority Leader moving to pass a small business extension to those who are suffering from the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats blocked the motion.\n\nMcConnell said on the Senate floor on Thursday:\n\nThe distinguished Democratic Leader and the Speaker of the House sought to use this crucial program to open broader negotiations on other topics, including parts of the CARES Act where literally no money has gone out the door yet.\n\nThe Democratic leadership has suggested they may hold Americans' paychecks hostage unless we pass another sweeping bill that spends half a trillion dollars doubling down on a number of parts of the CARES Act, including parts that have not even started to work yet.\n\nThe country cannot afford unnecessary wrangling or political maneuvering. Treating this as a normal, partisan negotiation could literally cost Americans their jobs.\n\nMalinowski also said on Thursday, \"We will replenish the small business program.

You don't send it in the mail where people pick up -- all sorts of bad thing can happen ... by the time it gets in and is tabulated. No, it shouldn't be mailed in. You should vote at the booth. And you should have voter ID, because when you have voter ID, that's the real deal.\"\n\nPresident Trump was absolutely right to highlight the dangers of mail-in voting. Compared to in-person voting with photo ID, the opportunities for voter fraud are much greater. Three forms of fraud occur wherever mail-in voting is allowed.\n\n1. Double voting. During my two terms as Kansas Secretary of State, I was the only secretary of state in the country with the power to prosecute election crimes. The most frequent form of voter fraud that my office prosecuted was double-voting -- in which the voter votes in two or more states, usually through mail-in voting. It occurs with shocking frequency. Indeed, a 2017 study looking at just 21 states revealed that approximately 8,400 people had double-voted in the 2016 election.\n\n2. Ballot harvesting. Mail-in voting also facilitates a second form of fraud: ballot harvesting -- a form of fraud whereby someone purporting to deliver the completed ballots on behalf of voters only delivers those ballots believed to favor a particular candidate. The country was introduced to ballot harvesting on the national stage in 2018 when the Mark Harris v. Dan McCready race for North Carolina's 9th Congressional District was in question for months, due to credible allegations that a contractor working for the Harris campaign had engaged in ballot harvesting.\n\nAs I wrote at the time, because the victim of the fraud was the Democrat, Nancy Pelosi suddenly changed her tune on the subject. She went from mocking allegations of voter fraud to describing just how significant the problem of voter fraud is: \"This is bigger than that one seat. This is about undermining the integrity of our elections. ... What was done there was so remarkable, in that that person, those entities, got away with that.\" Now she seems to have forgotten her own words on the subject.\n\n3. Falsely voting another person's ballot. A third form of fraud through mail-in voting occurs when someone fraudulently requests another person's mail-in ballot. The fraudster then intercepts the ballot at the real voter's mailbox, or he has the ballot sent to a phony address. He can then fraudulently vote the ballot and send it in.\n\nAlternatively, this form of fraud can be used without intercepting the ballot. The fraudster simply requests mail-in ballots for others to increase voter turnout in certain neighborhoods. Before I became Kansas Secretary of State, this form of fraud occurred more than 50 times in urban Wyandotte County, Kansas. It stopped when I introduced mail-in ballot security reforms to Kansas law. More on that below.\n\nAll three of these forms of fraud occur in the vast majority of states, which allow voters to choose to vote by mail. All except Kansas, that is, where two out of the three problems have been solved by the security reforms that I drafted and the Kansas Legislature enacted in 2011.\n\n4. Massive fraud in all-mail elections. There is a fourth form of voter fraud that is widespread in the three states that have all-mail voting -- Colorado, Oregon, and Washington state. Those states don't give the voter a choice. Instead, in every election, every registered voter is automatically sent a ballot. The results have been disastrous.\n\nBecause the states' voter rolls include so many invalid names -- deceased voters, people who have moved away, noncitizens, and duplicate registrations -- huge numbers of extra ballots are sent out by the relevant election officials to invalid names on the rolls. In 2012, the Pew Center on the States estimated that the voter rolls nationwide contain 24 million invalid names. As a result, nearly 250 counties have more names on the voter rolls than there are eligible voters living in the county.\n\nAs a result, hundreds of thousands of extra ballots are sent out. As the Colorado Secretary of State told me when Colorado first introduced all-mail balloting, it was a fiasco. Untold numbers of additional ballots arrived at addresses throughout the state. Even one of the Colorado state legislators received two ballots -- she was double-registered under her maiden name and her married name.\n\nWhen these additional ballots arrive in their mail box, many voters will be tempted to fill them out and send them in. It is a massive invitation to fraud.\n\nDemocrats in Congress, including Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have been calling for new federal law that would mandate all-mail balloting in all 50 states as a response to the coronavirus pandemic. Such a law would guarantee voter fraud on a scale never seen before; it should be opposed at all costs. Democrats in states such as Texas and Arizona have been calling for all-mail elections at the state level too.\n\nAssuming this disaster can be avoided, a likely scenario in elections this year will be that state election officials encourage voters to request absentee ballots on their own, under existing state laws. That would be better than an all-mail election mandate coming from Congress, but it would still be vulnerable to first three forms of fraud described above.\n\nThe solution is for state legislatures to take steps now to secure mail-in ballots like we did in Kansas. We added three security elements to mail-in voting that operate to prevent voter fraud. First, we required virtual photo ID; the person requesting the absentee ballot must either send in a photocopy of a qualifying photo ID or write his complete driver's license number on the ballot-request form. Second, we required signature verification. Every voter's signature has to be matched against the signature that the state has on file for that person. If the signature doesn't match, the voter is contacted and allowed to try signing again. If the signature still doesn't match, no ballot is sent out. Third, in a separate law, Kansas also deterred ballot harvesting by requiring the voter of a delivered ballot to sign the envelope and authorize a specific, named person to deliver the ballot on his behalf.\n\nIt is essential that the other states enact these reforms to make mail-in ballots more secure. If all states were to take these three steps, the mail-in ballot fraud that President Trump rightly pointed out could be avoided. But the time to act is now.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kris_w_kobach@breitbart.com", "name": "Kris W.

They \"are not good enough to be worth rolling out in very large scale\", he said.\n\n\"The test developed in China was validated against patients who were severely ill with a very large viral load, generating a large amount of antibodies... whereas we want to use the test in the context of a wider range of levels of infection including people who are quite mildly infected,\" Prof Newton said in comments reported by The Times.\n\n\"So for our purposes, we need a test that performs better than some of these other tests,\" he added.\n\nThis is not the first time that China-made tests for the Chinese coronavirus have proven faulty. Late last month, Spain, the country with the second-highest number of fatalities and the highest number of cases in Europe, bought thousands of faulty antibody testing kits from China's Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology. Chinese authorities claimed that Spain had purchased the tests, which were EU-certified, from a supplier that was not recommended by the Chinese state.\n\nTurkey also found some Chinese testing kits to be substandard, with the margin of error too high and giving false-negatives while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 faulty masks made in China.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage expressed shock that the UK was buying ventilators from China, with 300 sent to the NHS last week. Former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith criticised the business dealing, saying: \"China shouldn't be charging for this stuff. Why are they making money out of COVID-19 when it started in China? They shouldn't be deriving any significant benefit at all.\"\n\nOn Sunday, health secretary Matt Hancock announced that due to the government's strict social distancing measures slowing down the rate of infection, the government downgraded the projected need for 30,000 ventilators by the virus's peak to 18,000. However, the country is still a few thousand short of that figure, with the peak possibly hitting on Easter Sunday.\n\nMr Hancock said on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: \"We need to make sure we have more ventilators than there are people who need ventilation. At the moment, we have between 9,000 and 10,000 ventilators within the NHS right now, and we have the 2,000 spare that are critical care beds with ventilator capacity, ready, should people need to come into them and we're ramping that up.\"\n\n\"Our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming few weeks,\" he said.\n\nStating that another 1,500 would be available in the next week, the health minister said that he hopes the demand will be even lower. \"But the 18,000 is our current goal because we want to be ready with belt and braces for a worst-case scenario\" and that \"we are on track to meet that goal\".\n\nNeoconservative British think tank The Henry Jackson Society published a report on Sunday that recommended Western countries sue communist China for the coronavirus cover-up and failure to contain its disease.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Americans approve of President Donald Trump's handling of the crisis.\n\nApproval of President Trump's handling of the economy rose to 52 percent, the highest level of his presidency, CNBC's \"All America\" survey showed Wednesday. That is up from 49 percent in December.\n\nThe survey of 800 Americans was taken between Friday and Monday.\n\nTrump's overall approval rating jumped as well, to 46 percent from 40 percent. That too is the best ranking of the Trump presidency.\n\nTrump is even scoring higher marks from Democrats. His job approval rating rose to 20 percent among Democrats, a record high and up from 8 percent in December.\n\nThe high marks are all the more notable because the survey also reveals that ten percent of Americans say they lost their jobs because of the outbreak. Another 16 percent have had their pay cut.\n\nForty-five percent of Americans rate the economy as poor. Twenty-two percent rate it as \"fair,\" making for a combined 77 percent taking a dim view of the economy. That's up 20 points from December and the worst of Trump's presidency. Such pessimism was common, however, during Barack Obama's presidency.\n\nThe survey's results show that the economic contraction due to the virus has been severe but Americans remain optimistic. Fifty-one percent say they expect the economy to improve in the next year. Forty-nine percent expect the economy to return to normal in the next few months. Just six percent think the effects of the shutdown will last longer than a year.\n\nOnly one percent of Americans say they expect to lose their job in the next few weeks, suggesting that Americans think the worst of the shutdown's damage to the labor market may be over. A further eight percent expect that they will suffer a pay cut in the next few weeks.\n\nAmericans are not blaming President Donald Trump for Trump's job rating rose in the poll, with more Americans approving of his handling of the presidency than disapproving for the first time in the three years it's been tracked by CNBC.

President Donald Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBarr noted the media efforts to criticize hydroxychloroquine, a drug touted by Trump during appearances with the coronavirus task force.\n\n\"[I]t's very disappointing because I think the president went out at the beginning of this thing and really was statesmanlike, trying to bring people together, working with all the governors, keeping his patience as he got these snarky gotcha questions from the White House media pool,\" Barr said. \"And the stridency of the partisan attacks on him has gotten higher and higher, and it's really disappointing to see. And the politicization of decisions like hydroxychloroquine has been amazing to me.\"\n\n\"Before the president said anything about it, there was fair and balanced coverage of this very promising drug, and the fact that it had such a long track record that the risks were pretty well known,\" he continued. \"And as soon as he said something positive about it, the media has been on a jihad to discredit the drug.
