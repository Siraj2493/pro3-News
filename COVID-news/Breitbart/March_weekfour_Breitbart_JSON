[Emphasis added]\n\nThe provision means that all enrolled DACA illegal aliens would have their status immediately renewed and extended even as the nation's unemployment rate could skyrocket to 20 percent.\n\nLikewise, Pelosi's plan would immediately extend status for the more than 300,000 foreign nationals in the U.S. on Temporary Protected Status (TPS) -- ensuring that American workers are forced to compete for jobs amid an employment crisis against an amnestied population of foreign workers.\n\nAnnually, about 1.2 million legal immigrants are added to the U.S. population, a majority of which compete against America's working and middle class for jobs.

It allows anyone to drop off someone else's mail-in ballot at a polling station. There is no process for vetting or verifying those delivering the ballots -- no background checks or identification requirements. Democrats dropped hundreds of thousands of ballots off at polling stations in 2018, helping Democrats as they flipped seven Republican seats.\n\nThe practice is illegal in most other states, largely because it is susceptible to fraud and intimidation. Republicans were caught flat-footed in 2018; they have experimented with the tactic in recent special elections, only to find the their voters adamantly refuse to give their ballots to strangers. Democrats are more open to the practice -- often became the \"harvester\" also registers the voter, according to Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel.\n\nCalifornia's \"ballot harvesting\" law has yet to be challenged in court.

Instead, Pelosi announced that Democrats will move forward with their own bill.\n\nSubsequently, during a Sunday night vote on the coronavirus package, every Senate Democrat voted against the measure, which includes swing-state senators. Four of these swing-state senators are up for reelection in 2020.\n\nThe four Democrat senators, who have touted their bipartisan credentials but voted against the emergency coronavirus package, include:\n\nThe Senate Democrats' vote was widely condemned by lawmakers and other conservative groups.\n\n\"I want everybody to fully understand if we aren't able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor on Sunday.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) said on Sunday, \"It's unacceptable that my Dem colleagues are holding up immediate relief for workers, families, seniors, & businesses across US. This is a bipartisan package - many sections of the bill were written by/with Dems. This isn't a time for politics; it's a time for leadership & action.\"\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Communications Director Jesse Hunt said on Sunday:\n\nNancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Senate Democrats allowed partisan fervor to thwart a critical coronavirus relief package while our country faces a crippling pandemic. DSCC-backed candidates last weekend had no problem throwing partisan barbs at the same Republican senators working day and night to find solutions to the complex problems facing their constituents at home. Those same candidates should prove they aren't beholden to their chief benefactor Schumer and disavow Senate Democrats' unthinkable decision to filibuster.\n\nCongressional Leadership Fund (CLF) Communications Director Calvin Moore said in a statement on Monday:\n\nEven facing the worst economic and public health crisis of our day, Washington Democrats cannot stop themselves from playing politics with people's lives. Democrats would rather put lives on the line, cause irreparable damage to the American economy, and force small businesses to go belly up than do the right thing. Americans should be appalled.\n\nRetired general and New Hampshire Senate Republican candidate Don Bolduc said in a statement on Sunday that Shaheen's vote against the coronavirus package was \"shameful.\"\n\n\"It finally seemed as if Washington was going to put politics aside to get something done, but Sen. Shaheen couldn't set her partisanship aside. Now, American families and businesses will have to wait for the relief they need. The economy will suffer,\" Bolduc said.\n\nTori Sachs, the executive director for Michigan Rising Action, slammed Peters and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), saying, \"Michigan Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters voted Sunday to delay a bill that would give critical financial resources to American workers and families impacted by the coronavirus crisis.\"\n\n\"During one of her many national television appearances, Gov. Whitmer should ask Stabenow and Peters to support the bipartisan deal that will give much needed financial relief to Michiganders,\" Sachs added.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType":

Months", "body": "The opacity of the Chinese Communist government obliges responsible outside observers to look for clues to the truth of the coronavirus epidemic, instead of merely repeating official information without question.\n\nThe official count from China is 3,277 fatalities from 81,171 infections as of Tuesday, but the Epoch Times noted the troubling disappearance of some 21 million cell phone accounts in China over the past three months - an unprecedented decline that hints at more fatalities than Beijing is prepared to admit.\n\nIt should be stated at the outset that we should not be forced to read tea leaves to figure out what really happened in China, especially in the virus epicenter of Hubei province and the city of Wuhan, where Chinese officials are currently making claims of zero new infections that no one seriously believes. While more responsible governments issue troubling warnings of a second wave of infections, severe enough to prompt the re-imposition of quarantine procedures that were only recently lifted, China claims it has no second wave and all of its new coronavirus cases are imported.\n\nWith that in mind, the Epoch Times thought it was a bit odd for 21 million Chinese cell phones to abruptly disappear, given that cell phone usage has been increasing constantly in China for years, and phones have been touted as an important tool for containing the coronavirus epidemic:\n\nChina's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced on March 19 the number of phone users in each province in February. Compared with the previous announcement, which was released on Dec. 18, 2019, for November 2019 data, both cellphone and landline users dropped dramatically. In the same period the year before, the number of users increased.\n\nThe number of cellphone users decreased from 1.600957 billion to 1.579927 billion, a drop of 21.03 million. The number of landline users decreased from 190.83 million to 189.99 million, a drop of 840,000.\n\nIn the previous February, the number increased. According to MIIT, the number of cellphone users increased in February 2019 from 1.5591 billion to 1.5835 billion, which is 24.37 million more. The number of landline users increased from 183.477 million to 190.118 million, which is 6.641 million more.\n\nAccording to China's National Bureau of Statistics, the country's population at the end of 2019 was 4.67 million larger than in 2018, reaching 1.40005 billion.\n\nThe article went on to postulate that some of the landlines might have been shut down as a consequence of the coronavirus quarantines, particularly lines used by shuttered business operations, but the sheer magnitude of the cell phone user decline makes it more difficult to explain. China Mobile, the nation's largest carrier, reported gaining 3.7 million new accounts in December but then losing over 8 million in January and February, months in which it posted gains of 3.5 million users the previous year.\n\nThe Epoch Times considered several explanations for the loss of users, such as migrant workers who kept different cell phones for their home and work cities - necessary due to some of China's regulations on phone service - abandoning the work phone because it was not needed during the quarantine period, or people generally canceling their phone service because they wanted to save money during the hard months.\n\nOn the other hand, the government is currently requiring citizens to use their cell phones to generate \"health codes\" so their movements can be tracked and permission to travel can be restricted to healthy individuals, so as U.S.-based commentator Tang Jiangyuan put it, it is effectively \"impossible for a person to cancel his cellphone.\"\n\n\"Dealing with the government for pensions and social security, buying train tickets, shopping ... no matter what people want to do, they are required to use cell phones,\" Tang noted.\n\nThe New York Times explained just how heavily Chinese authorities are leaning on those cell phones to monitor their population, and not just for coronavirus infections:\n\nThe Times's analysis found that as soon as a user grants the software access to personal data, a piece of the program labeled \"reportInfoAndLocationToPolice\" sends the person's location, city name and an identifying code number to a server. The software does not make clear to users its connection to the police. But according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency and an official police social media account, law enforcement authorities were a crucial partner in the system's development.\n\nWhile Chinese internet companies often share data with the government, the process is rarely so direct. In the United States, it would be akin to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using apps from Amazon and Facebook to track the coronavirus, then quietly sharing user information with the local sheriff's office.\n\nThe system, which relies on a unit of the immense Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, assigns users a green, yellow, or red \"health code\" in the style of a traffic light. Predictably, Chinese citizens find the opaque system cryptic and frightening, since the government has not explained exactly how it works.\n\n\"In some cities, residents now have to register their phone numbers with an app to take public transportation,\" the Times added.\n\nAt the beginning of March, the so-called Alipay Health Code system had been launched in the city of Hangzhou, expanded to 200 other cities, and was on its way to a complete nationwide rollout. The rollout ran into some hitches over the following weeks, from technical glitches to confusion caused by local governments adding their own health codes to the already intimidating system.\n\nA correspondent writing for Bloomberg News on March 18 reported using the system and said it was in the process of being \"rolled out nationwide at railway stations, restaurants, pharmacies, and more.\" Other reports in China have noted how cell phones are ubiquitous there and are employed for everything from accessing public and commercial resources to telecommuting to school during the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nWith this in mind, it might not be completely impossible to get by in Chinese cities without a cell phone at the moment, but it seems unlikely that a huge number of citizens would choose this moment to get rid of their phones.\n\n\"Lacking data, the real death toll in China is a mystery. The cancellation of 21 million cellphones provides a data point that suggests the real number may be far higher than the official number,\" the Epoch Times concluded.", "source": {"uri":

Bill", "body": "The Hill reported Sunday that one of the reasons bipartisan support for a massive coronavirus stimulus package has fallen apart is, once again, because Democrats want the bill to prop up Planned Parenthood.\n\nAccording to the Hill:\n\nA Democratic aide said that the small business provision was drafted to exclude non-profits who receive Medicaid from being eligible for Small Business Administration assistance offered under the bill. That, according to the aide, would impact Planned Parenthood but also community health centers, rape crisis centers and disability service providers.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is identified as a nonprofit, not a small business.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Sunday she will be moving ahead with her own emergency relief package and ended hopes for an immediate vote in the Senate to further assistance for the nation in the midst of the crisis caused by the virus that originated in China.\n\nBreitbart News reported:\n\nSenate Republicans and the White House have insisted that they will continue to push for the $1.6 trillion economic relief package, which would include $350 billion in support for small businesses and $250 billion for unemployment insurance. The package would also include direct cash payments to individuals around $1,200 per individual, with additional funds going to families with children.\n\nPolitico also reported that Pelosi's announcement is an indication she will not be simply taking up the Senate bill and moving it forward on a unanimous consent basis:\n\nThat also means the House may be forced back into session, even though many lawmakers are concerned about the threat from the coronavirus and the difficulties in reaching Capitol Hill from their home districts.\n\nFox News reported on the impasse:\n\nDemocrats also pushed for add-ons including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers -- saying the three months of unemployment insurance offered under the draft plan was insufficient.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel also weighed in on the stalemate on Twitter:\n\nTwo weeks ago, it was discovered Pelosi attempted to ensure a Hyde Amendment loophole was included in an earlier coronavirus economic stimulus proposal. The Hyde Amendment is a longstanding provision applied to spending bills that states taxpayer monies will not be used to fund abortions.\n\nPelosi, Planned Parenthood, and other members of the abortion lobby accused Republicans of holding up that emergency bill to promote their \"anti-abortion agenda.\"\n\nThe Democrat leader herself criticized Republican leaders, stating \"families have needs,\" and that a decision was needed \"to help families right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

trading curbs in their first hour of trading Sunday night after Democrat pushed back against economic rescue measures on Capitol Hill.\n\nFutures contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell by 5 percent, triggering downside limits that prevent the contracts from trading 5 percent below the prior close. The limits are intended to prevent panicked sell-off and ensure orderly markets but they can obscure market signals by concealing selling pressure until the opening at 9:30 a.m.\n\nThe Nasdaq was down by almost 5 percent.\n\nTraders appeared to be reacting to developments in Washington, D.C. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, said Sunday afternoon that she rejected the idea of working on the plan in the U.S. Senate supported by Republicans and the White House. She said she would instead move forward with her own economic package.\n\nThe Senate on Sunday night failed to advance its economic rescue bill, with lawmakers voting 47 to 47 on a procedural vote that required 60 votes to move the bill forward. Five Senators were not present to cast votes because they are self-quarantined due to coronavirus concerns.\n\nDemocrats have accused Republicans of rushing the process. Roll Call reported:\n\nThe vote had been delayed by three hours Sunday amid deepening rifts over the massive economic stimulus package, with Democrats expressing frustration that GOP leaders were rushing on a measure that they said didn't do enough to help workers and was too generous toward corporate interests.\n\nFew outside of Washington view efforts to pass an economic rescue package as rushed. Many economists have stressed the need for a swift government reaction to the extreme economic stress created by the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news",

Bill Cassidy (R-LA) told Breitbart News that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are obstructing a tentative emergency relief bill to provide financial relief to Americans during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"It's incredibly frustrating,\" said Cassidy in an interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel Pollak. \"Democrats and Republicans broke down into five working groups. They came to agreement on all five areas -- appropriations, for example, tax law changes upon health and welfare issues, etcetera -- we put them into a package, and now we had a vote tonight that would just allow us to continue to debate it for the next 30 hours. Keep in mind, all this negotiation has taken place between Democrats and Republicans. Pelosi came over with Schumer after having agreed to everything, and then said no, they that wanted something different, far different.\"\n\nCassidy continued, \"So when the original package -- which was agreed upon -- was brought up just to allow 30 more hours to debate, Democrats voted against. Now we've got an American economy which is just tanking because we don't have certainty as to the government's response, and Pelosi and Schumer have decided that they are going to obstruct after they helped negotiate the deal.\"\n\nCassidy went on, \"This is something that we don't need at this moment, and we're speaking about a package, which is huge -- which is the biggest package ever put out by the federal government -- to help the American people. And it would provide certainty for those who know that tomorrow they're going to have to make note payments in two weeks.\n\n\"I cannot believe that Pelosi and Schumer are attempting to do this,\" added Cassidy. \"Frankly, I am shocked that Democratic senators are going along with it. I'm not a partisan guy, at this point. I'm so sorry they are.\"\n\nCassidy remarked, \"This is about the American people, not about being a Democrat or Republican.\"\n\nCassidy stated, \"I know what's going through the mind of Americans if

he added. \"We were doing just fine until that intervention.\"\n\nIn contrast, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) blamed Republicans for advancing legislation without an agreement.\n\nSchumer said on the Senate floor:\n\nThe majority leader was well aware of how the vote would go before it happened but he chose to go forward with it anyway even though negotiations are continuing.

DSCC-backed candidates last weekend had no problem throwing partisan barbs at the same Republican senators working day and night to find solutions to the complex problems facing their constituents at home. Those same candidates should prove they aren't beholden to their chief benefactor Schumer and disavow Senate Democrats' unthinkable decision to filibuster.\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said in a statement on Sunday:\n\n\u202aHow pathetic. Tonight's vote was not even on passing a bipartisan plan, it was merely to begin debating it. The American people are hurting, the clock is ticking, but Senate Democrats would rather cave to Speaker Pelosi's eleventh-hour demands. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle should worry more about getting relief to their constituents and less about the House Speaker's partisan wish list.

Around a part of our unified command is the federal government. Homeland Security, as well as the FBI. So in reaching out, meaning my health directors and public safety officials, every step of the way consulted with federal partners as well as the CDC in reference to COVID-19.\"\n\nShe continued, \"The federal government did not issue any red flags and, therefore, we moved forward with federal agents being a part of our unified command on the ground.

So every step of the way, the federal government has been partners with us with Mardi Gras. No red flags were given. So absolutely, we moved forward.\"\n\nBlitzer said, \"Yeah, you certainly did. I'll ask you the same question I asked your governor yesterday with hindsight. We are all obviously a lot smarter with hindsight. Do you think Mardi Gras could or should have been closed this year?\"\n\nCantrell said, \"Well, if red flags were given at the federal level, leadership matters. So while I was the first in the state of Louisiana to stop social gatherings, I had to cancel the St. Patrick's Day Parade. All hell broke loose when I did that. It was necessary, giving the data, allowing science to lead us. It does matter. We rely on the facts to make decisions for the people that we serve. Given no red flags, we moved forward. In hindsight, if we were given clear direction, we would not have had Mardi Gras, and I would have been the leader to cancel.\"\n\nBlitzer said, \"I know, I guess reports are within a week or two after Mardi Gras, all of a sudden the cases started emerging in Louisiana. Obviously, that's very disturbing.\"\n\nHe asked, \"You are saying no one from the federal government came to you and urged you to at least can sell or postpone Mardi Gras?\"\n\nCantrell responded, \"That's absolutely correct. And not only that, it was backed up with the response of our national leader. When it's not taken seriously at the federal level, it's very difficult to transcend down to the local level in making these decisions.

Hearing there was another, younger patient suffering from the disease and who had no ventilator, Father Berardelli gave him his own.\n\n\"Father Giuseppe Berardelli died as a priest,\" said one of the healthcare workers in the Saint Joseph retirement home where the priest lived. \"I am profoundly moved by the fact that he, as archpriest of Casnigo, freely renounced his respirator to give it to someone younger than him.\"\n\nThe priest died during the night of March 15 in the hospital of Lovere, in Bergamo, but his story only began to circulate on Italian media on Monday. Like many others who have succumbed to the disease, Father Berardelli already suffered from severe health complications.\n\nThe deceased priest is being compared to Saint Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish priest who was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II and offered to take the place of another prisoner who had been condemned to death.\n\nIn punishment for an escaped prisoner, guards had randomly chose ten prisoners to be starved to death. One of the men chosen began to plead for his life, insisting that he had a wife and family. At that point Father Kolbe offered to take the man's place, noting that he had no wife, after which the priest was thrown in the starvation bunker, where he died days later.\n\nAt least 50 priests have reportedly died with the coronavirus in Italy, many of whom followed the appeal of Pope Francis to go out and assist others during this difficult time, even at the risk of their own lives.\n\nAs of Monday evening, Italy has reported 6,077 deaths of people with coronavirus, at an average age of 81, almost all of whom suffered from other serious diseases.

Other translations note that the Chinese characters also insult Japan as \"little\" and hope the virus spread \"forever after that [arrival into Japan]\":\n\nThe Times claimed that the business itself profusely apologized on government-run social media and fired the manager that put up the decoration, in addition to police detaining the person. The restaurant claimed owners were not notified or aware of the banner before it went up.\n\nThe newspaper identified the manager as a 30-something worker who had been there for some time and claimed that the banner was only up for about 90 minutes before police arrived at the scene. As China does not allow independent media outlets to operate within its borders, there are no independent reports confirming that this was the case. The news service UPI identified the manager as having the last name \"Hui,\" but not much more is known about the person or his or her fate after being detained by Chinese police.\n\nThe banner appeared to celebrate the growing numbers of deaths in both Japan and America. At press time, Japan has documented 1,307 cases of Chinese coronavirus nationwide and 45 deaths. In the United States, which has a much larger population than Japan, medical experts have logged more than 69,000 coronavirus cases and 1,046 deaths. Both nations are attempting to limit social contact to slow the spread of the highly contagious Chinese virus, though America has currently taken much more extreme measures in banning many American businesses from operating, triggering record numbers of jobless claims nationwide.\n\nWhile the Global Times wrote of the celebration of American deaths on the part of Mother Yang's, it has participated in the evidence-free accusations that Washington is responsible for the pandemic. An article in the state-run publication this month claimed that a U.S. Army facility in Fort Detrick, Maryland, was responsible for engineering a new form of coronavirus to be more contagious and difficult to treat. Chinese government officials also propagated the conspiracy theory. In the United States, Chinese Foreign Ministry official Zhao Lijian wrote on Twitter, \"It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.\"\n\nThe Communist Party bans citizens who are not high-ranking Party members from using Twitter. Twitter has refused to hold Chinese officials to its terms of service about sharing dangerous disinformation.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has repeatedly condemned Beijing for baselessly accusing the United States of fabricating the disease.\n\n\"My concern is that this cover-up, this disinformation that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in, is still denying the world the information it needs so that we can prevent further cases or something like this from recurring again,\" Pompeo said this week. \"The disinformation campaign from Russia and Iran as well as China continues. They're talking about it coming from the U.S. Army, and they're saying maybe it began in Italy, all things to deflect responsibility.\"\n\nThe Chinese coronavirus originated in Wuhan, central China, in November. Chinese officials did nothing about the growing outbreak for months until privately alerting the World Health Organization (WHO) in January and shutting down a wild meat market that it believed was the origin location for the outbreak, as coronaviruses tend to infect humans after living in animals through consumption. Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, is home to 11 million people and to China's Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, which is licensed to handle the world's most dangerous pathogens. The Chinese government boasted that the facility identified the Wuhan virus as a new pathogen at a breakneck pace.\n\nThat month - after January 20, when China finally told the world it had identified a new virus - the WHO told the world that, according to Chinese scientists, the coronavirus was not contagious from human to human. Scientists now know that this was not true, and the Chinese coronavirus is highly contagious, thus allegedly necessitating the shutdown of nearly the entirety of the American economy.\n\nA February study also found evidence that the virus did not originate at the shut-down meat market, also raising questions as to China's initial response to what is now a pandemic.\n\nA study by the University of Southhampton found this month that had the Communist Party not detained doctors warning in December and January about a contagious disease spreading in Wuhan and otherwise silenced evidence about the outbreak, about 95 percent of the world's coronavirus cases could have been prevented.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

be held \"accountable\" for what he sees as their anti-business and anti-capitalist agenda in the face of the global coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHe also called on Pelosi, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and others to stop \"playing politics with our lives.\"\n\nDavi posted a series of videos to Twitter Monday saying that Pelosi and others he described as \"Marxists\" are using the crisis as an opportunity to push a socialist plan on the American people. \"Every plan that the Democrats have is corrupt,\" the License to Kill actor said. \"What they want is what Bernie Sanders wants, which is a revolution... They're using this to collapse the nation.\"\n\nPelosi has been a key force blocking the passage of a $1.6 trillion Congressional stimulus package that would provide much-needed relief to Americans as the global coronavirus pandemic continues to threaten the U.S. economy. Along with Schumer, Pelosi has criticized the bill for being too pro-business.\n\nDavi said in his Twitter video that private businesses form the backbone of the U.S. economy. \"Unless there are businesses there are no workers of the world,\" he said. \"The left will take your freedoms away from you. The left is dangerous.\"\n\nThe conservative Hollywood actor also cautioned people not to trust the mainstream media. \"They're not telling you what's going on,\" he said, adding later: \"We're in a crisis point. We have to work together.

Evidently the protesters are infuriated by how the government has treated them during the crisis - infuriated enough to flip over police cars and swarm past riot control barriers.\n\nAccording to the \"Things China Doesn't Want You to Know\" Twitter account quoted above, there are rumors the riot was kicked off by a fight between Hubei and Jiangxi police officers. The Hubei police were reportedly angered by Jiangxi police crossing into their jurisdiction.\n\nA number of Hubei police officers appear to have joined the civilian demonstrators in their march toward Jiangxi, and evidently raised few objections when the civilians decided to trash a few Jiangxi police cars and club riot police with their own shields.\n\nNoted Chinese dissident Badiucao heard rumors that the fight broke out because Jiangxi police resisted orders to open the border to Hubei after the coronavirus lockdown officially ended on Wednesday. One reason for their reluctance, according to Badiucao, is that \"no one trusts the official numbers\" for reduced coronavirus infections in Hubei, not even the police.\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA) reported the demonstration was still going strong after eight hours of escalating confrontations:\n\nJiangxi police on a checkpoint on the bridge had allowed a group of migrant workers stranded during the lockdown to pass, but had refused to allow Hubei residents through.\n\nAfter angry disputes broke out, Jiangxi police sent in riot police to seal off the entrance to Jiujiang.\n\nVideo footage posted to YouTube showed thousands of people marching up the approach road to the bridge, shoulder to shoulder with uniformed police from Hubei, shouting \"Go Hubei! Go Hubei!\"\n\nA Hubei resident told RFA people from the province feel stigmatized and discriminated against, as they are still unwelcome in some other parts of China and treated poorly even when allowed to enter.\n\nRFA confirmed on Friday morning that the bridge battle broke out after Jiangxi police \"injured Hubei police in the morning.\" The civilian protesters expressed anger at the way they have been treated during the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nCanada's Globe and Mail quoted a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) official yelling at the crowd through a loudspeaker and telling them it was \"dangerous\" to gather on the bridge due to \"the risk of virus infection,\" but the warning did not appear to be widely heeded.\n\nThe Communist Party's People's Daily did report on the bridge conflict even as social media videos were scrubbed, describing it as \"regrettable.\"\n\n\"The people of Hubei have made great efforts and significant contributions to winning the battle against the epidemic. People from all sectors of society have also been calling for the acceptance of Hubei's migrant workers. However, it's undeniable that some individuals of some regions have intentionally or unintentionally discriminated against Hubei people, set up obstacles for them to return to work,\" the People's Daily wrote.\n\nThe Globe and Mail reported growing skepticism of the CCP's claims to have controlled the epidemic, citing health officials who admitted thousands of asymptomatic patients were systematically excluded from the official counts to produce the \"zero local infections\" figure uncritically repeated by the World Health Organization and many American media outlets. Furthermore, the number of cremated remains returned to grieving families by the authorities this week is noticeably larger than the 3,200 deaths officially admitted by the CCP.", "source": {"uri":

SEIU-UHW has 97,000 members who work in hospitals across California.\n\nWithin 48 hours of painstakingly calling leads and potential suppliers, the union discovered a distributor who had the 39 million masks, and has since found another supplier who says his company can produce 20 million more masks a week. The union also has found a supplier who can deliver millions of face shields.\n\nThe union said it will be selling the masks to states, counties and hospitals for $5 apiece and claims it \"has no financial interest in the transactions.\"\n\nSimilar N95 masks are available on the Home Depot website for $23.97 for a box of 20, or about $1.20 apiece.\n\nThe unidentified supplier said it has already sold some of the masks to the state of California, the Greater New York Hospital Association, Dignity Health, Kaiser Permanente, Stanford Health Care, Sutter Health, Los Angeles, Riverside,

Use of Minority Banks", "body": "The bill being pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the Democrat alternative to the White House-backed efforts to rescue the economy includes a requirement that federal agencies maximize their use of minority-owned banks.\n\nThe bill would order the Treasury Secretary to designate certain banks as 'minority banks' and publish a list of approved institutions. This list would be distributed to federal agencies, local and state governments, and interested private sector companies.\n\nThe bill says that each federal agency \"shall develop and implement standards and procedures to ensure, to the maximum extent possible as permitted by law, the use of minority banks and minority credit unions to serve the financial needs of each such department or agency.\"\n\nFederal agencies are required to report within two years of the bill's passage on actions taken to increase the use of minority banks, highlighting just how little connection the provision has to dealing with the acute economic emergency created by the coronavirus. Each agency will have to submit a similar report every year after the initial report.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

from Gallup shows that President Donald Trump's approval rating for his handling of the coronavirus is now at 60 percent.\n\nThe last time Trump earned a 49 percent approval rating was in late January

also independents.\n\nSixty percent of independents favor Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and even 27 percent of Democrats approve of his response.\n\nTrump's approval rating jumped five points from Gallup's earlier poll conducted between March 2-13.\n\nDespite leveling tough restrictions on Americans to fight the spread of the virus, the president signaled he was ready for the country to go back to work in a few weeks.\n\n\"I would love to have the country opened up and rearing to go by Easter,\" he said during a Fox News town hall on Tuesday at the White House.", "source":
