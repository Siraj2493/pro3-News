On December 30, 2019, he wrote a post to a closed group of medical school classmates on the WeChat social media site. In the post called \"Seven cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market\", he warned about an outbreak of undiagnosed pneumonia at his hospital.\n\nA screenshot of his post was leaked and circulated online on December 31, a day before the local health authority made an official announcement saying that 27 cases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause had been detected.\n\nOn January 1, Wuhan police said they were punishing eight people for \"spreading rumours.\"\n\nIt was later revealed that all eight were medical staff.\n\nThe bitter irony is that Li was not trying to be a \"whistleblower\" in the common sense of the word at first. He sent his warning to other doctors - the Chinese government originally portrayed them all as random loudmouths who did not know what they were talking about - and advised them to take sensible precautions. He did not tell them to spread the word. According to Chinese media (always an unreliable source of information about politically sensitive issues) he was actually quite upset when he saw his advisory spreading beyond the half-dozen medical professionals he originally sent it to.\n\nThe Wuhan police accused Li of \"severely disturbing public order\" by \"spreading rumors,\" and forced him to sign a humiliating statement that promised he would keep quiet, but when he realized just how contagious and dangerous the Wuhan virus is, he kept talking. He did a great deal of this talking from a hospital bed because he contracted the disease in early January after contracting it from a glaucoma patient he treated in his role as an ophthalmologist at the Wuhan Central Hospital. At the time, the Chinese Communist Party adamantly insisted the virus could not be spread by casual human contact.\n\nThe Party has never apologized for how Li was abused after issuing his prescient warning about the Wuhan epidemic, but when news of his death broke and the Chinese public mourned him as a fallen hero, the Party moved quickly to cover its tracks and get a piece of the hero-worship action. Various government officials saluted Li and offered lavish condolences for his loss. Beijing's top anti-corruption agency announced it would send a team to Wuhan to investigate how the doctor was mistreated by local officials.\n\nAnd then the Communists did what they always do - silence everyone who did not accept the new political narrative about a heroic Party man wronged by buffoonish local officials:\n\nSince his death was announced, more than half a million internet users have left messages in response to Li's last post on Weibo. The commentaries are a mixture of loss at his death and anger at the authorities. Many declared him an \"ordinary hero\".\n\nOn Thursday night and Friday morning, three rapidly trending social media hashtags - \"The Wuhan government owes Li Wenliang an apology\", \"I want freedom of speech\", and \"We want freedom of speech\" - were seen millions of times before they were censored.\n\nMore angry social media posts accumulated on Friday and were rapidly erased by government censors, as cataloged in another South China Morning Post report:\n\nAngry comments about the official announcement of his death were also deleted, including one that read: \"I've learned two phrases: political rescue and performative rescue.\"\n\nOne social media user wrote: \"I cannot continue to scroll through Weibo, I am so disappointed with the country. Everyone wears a mask and covers their mouth, but can only shed tears secretly at home as they watch the corpses lying everywhere.\"\n\n[...]\n\nSome people shared Do You Hear the People Sing?, a song from the musical Les Miserables adopted as an anthem by protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nCNN collected a few more, including angry posts from people who thought the chaos on Thursday was simply the Communist government trying to delay confirmation of Li's death until after most Chinese citizens had turned in for the night:\n\nTop comments under the Wuhan Central Hospital's statement about Li's death included \"I've learned two words: political rescue & performative rescue\" and \"Countless young people will mature overnight after today: the world is not as beautiful as we imagined. Are you angry? If any of us here is fortunate enough to speak up for the public in the future, please make sure you remember tonight's anger.\"\n\nSeveral comments also marked the timing of the announcement. \"I knew you would post this in the middle of the night,\" wrote one Weibo user.\n\n\"You think we've all gone to sleep? No. We haven't,\" said another.\n\nAlso making the rounds online was an unverified audio recording, purportedly from Li's mother, saying she and her husband survived the coronavirus and emerged from quarantine only to learn of their 34-year-old son's death.\n\nChinese state media labored to refocus all of this public anger on the local officials who are about to be scapegoated.\n\nThe Global Times simply asserted that all public outrage boiled down to a demand for Wuhan officials to apologize to Li for his shabby treatment at their hands. Most remarkably, the state-run paper said the only thing people found objectionable about the propaganda antics on Thursday is that Li was kept on life support for too long:\n\nPeople are grieving and furious, and have begun raising questions about why the hospital gave him emergency treatment for an excessive five hours after his heart had stopped beating.\n\n\"Tonight, social consensus has collapsed,\" a veteran social affairs observer surnamed Huang said in a WeChat post. The public is demanding justice for authorities in Wuhan, including apologies from local authorities for Li and thousands of patients infected with the coronavirus, she said.\n\nThe battle against the deadly virus should be fact-driven and should prioritize the interests of the people. The first thing that should be done is addressing the public outrage, observers said.\n\nThe Global Times concluded by quoting a semi-anonymous Beijing journalist who hoped Li's death would \"make people understand that excessive bureaucracy will eventually lead to public opinion crises or the crises concerning people's livelihood,\" another ominous sentiment for the designated fall guys in Wuhan (which, incidentally, is a city larger than New York, not a backwater village administered by rubes who never talk to the home office in Beijing).\n\nThe official Communist Party newspaper People's Daily did not bother mentioning all that unpleasantness with Li getting arrested as a rumor-monger. It just portrayed Li as a Party hero whose tragic death should serve as an example of service to others:\n\nAlthough it was an individual case, the fact that Li didn't win his fight against the coronavirus has shown the complexity and difficulty of the battle against the epidemic.\n\nAs many of the late Dr. Li's colleagues are fighting on the front line of the battle, trying their best to save lives, people from all walks of life can actively help pass on love to one another.\n\nAt present, China has entered a critical stage of epidemic prevention and control work. The country needs solidarity more than ever to jointly win a battle that it cannot lose, so that its people can be protected against disaster and patients around the country can return to health.\n\nNo one can make an accurate prediction about when the battle will end, but everyone knows that only with sufficient confidence can the people win the battle against the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese dictator Xi Jinping called U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday morning to express his \"full confidence\" that China would win the \"people's war\" against the coronavirus. The WSJ interpreted this language as Xi signaling that China would not request \"large amounts of overseas aid\" to battle the epidemic.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news",

"China Deletes Reports About Death of Wuhan Virus Whistleblower Doctor", "body": "Several Chinese state media outlets reported the death of Dr. Li Wenliang on Thursday, only to delete their reports a few hours later and publish new bulletins indicating he remains in critical condition at Wuhan Central Hospital.\n\nNo explanation was offered for why the death of Li, who was arrested for \"spreading rumors\" after providing one of the earliest warnings about the true danger of the coronavirus epidemic, was incorrectly reported by state-controlled media.\n\nLi was one of eight people notoriously arrested in December for \"rumor-mongering\" by warning colleagues about the highly contagious nature of the Wuhan virus. He went on to contract the virus in January from one of his patients and has been hospitalized for several weeks.\n\nHis death was widely reported on Thursday morning, to the great dismay of the Chinese public, which expressed anger that a heroic whistleblower died from the coronavirus after suffering mistreatment by the authorities, and fear that a 34-year-old man in seemingly good health could die from the disease. According to official Chinese government reports, most of the roughly 560 people who have died from the Wuhan virus to date were elderly or had serious medical conditions before they contracted the disease.\n\nThe first indication of Li's death was a Twitter post from China's state-run Global Times, which would have been intended for an international audience since Twitter is banned in China. The tweet has since been deleted, along with various stories in Chinese media about his death including a post by the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Daily.\n\n\"In the fight against the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection, our hospital's ophthalmologist Li Wenliang was unfortunately infected. He is currently in critical condition and we are trying our best to resuscitate him,\" Wuhan Central Hospital said on Thursday afternoon in a statement quoted by CNN, suggesting he was still alive.\n\nAn earlier statement from the hospital said, \"During the fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak, Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at our hospital, was infected. Efforts to save him were ineffective. He died at 2:58 a.m on Feb. 7. We deeply regret and mourn his death.\" The Global Times later published a tweet with similar language.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Dr Li Wenliang. We all need to celebrate work that he did,\" said the World Health Organization in a tweet that was also subsequently deleted.\n\nForeign Policy anointed Li the \"first virus martyr\" when news of his death was published, noting that a large-scale scrubbing of news and social media posts about him commenced immediately.\n\nFP was skeptical of the subsequent claims that Li is still alive, suspecting Beijing is trying to determine whether it can sell angry citizens on the image of Li as a Party hero who gave his life trying to protect the people:\n\nAs news of his death spread like wildfire on social media, however, previous reports were deleted, as were threads about him -- one of which had recorded 5 million comments -- and the claim was put out that he had been \"resuscitated\" though was still \"in critical condition.\" It may be that Li was truly lingering on the edge of death. Or it may be that the government was terrified of the possibility of making a martyr. There are claims that Li's body was literally strapped back into life support when the extent of public anger online became clear. In the end, his employer stated he had died at 2:58 am Friday.\n\nThe New York Post reported that at least two friends of Li have reported his death, one of them doing so in a post on Weibo (the Twitter-like service that Chinese subjects are allowed to read) that also called for the government of Wuhan to apologize for harassing him.\n\nLi was not just arrested in December, but humiliated by local authorities. The doctor was forced to sign a letter that patronizingly read, \"We solemnly warn you: If you keep being stubborn, with such impertinence, and continue this illegal activity, you will be brought to justice. Is that understood?\"\n\nIt should be noted that while he felt obliged to sign the letter, Li never stopped using his Weibo account to challenge inaccurate government reports about the virus, including persistent false claims that it could not be spread between humans.\n\nThe South China Morning Post sifted through the \"chaotic messaging\" from Wuhan Central Hospital and concluded its last statements indicated Li is dead. According to this report, the last grim declaration from the hospital \"capped several chaotic hours in which Chinese media first reported Li's death, only for the hospital to respond that Li was alive, though in critical condition.\"\n\nIf the confused messaging was an effort by the Chinese Communists to manage public grief and anger over Li's mistreatment, illness, and death, it does not appear to be working - although the good news, from Beijing's point of view, is that much of the outrage has been focused on easily scapegoated Wuhan officials rather than dictator Xi Jinping or the national government.\n\nThe SCMP quoted several furious posts on social media:\n\nChinese social media has been awash with anger over the death of the whistle-blower - some mourning Li's death with candles, some demanding that the authorities apologise for the way they had treated him.\n\n\"None of the police has ever apologised to you. You could have been a national hero, but the dereliction of duty has claimed your life, along with a few hundred innocent lives,\" a user said on Weibo.\n\n\"The reprimand of Doctor Li will be a shame in China's anti-epidemic history. Doctor Li alerted the public at the expense of his life. Wuhan police station still hasn't recalled that reprimand notice even after his death,\" another Weibo user wrote.\n\n\"Dr. Li's fate is a singularly delicate issue for the Chinese government, which has tried to fight back against the coronavirus, while also stifling widespread criticism that officials have delayed and mismanaged the government's response to the initial outbreak in Wuhan,\" observed the New York Times, which thought the reports of Li's death were more poorly sourced than the ones that claimed he was clinging to life.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType":

Massachusetts resident with the virus and the eighth confirmed case in the United States.\n\nAccording to a news release issued by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the man, who is in his 20s and lives in Boston, has been isolated since his diagnosis and will remain isolated until cleared by public health officials.\n\nThe man's close contacts are also being monitored for any signs of symptoms, health officials said.\n\n\"We are grateful that this young man is recovering and sought medical attention immediately,\" said Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel.

Chinese officials alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) of a burgeoning outbreak, however, on December 31, and shut down a wild meat market in Wuhan suspected of being the origin of the outbreak a day later, failing to warn health workers or Wuhan residents to take protective measures against a highly contagious disease.\n\nChina's secrecy, inability to contain the virus, and failure to cooperate with the American Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on virus response have triggered global outrage.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the virus -- which can trigger deadly pneumonia -- has killed nearly 500 people worldwide, all but two within China, and infected over 20,000 people.\n\nThe Global Times celebrated the Communist Party as an ideal vehicle in public health crisis response in its column Monday, calling the coronavirus outbreak a \"chance for the outside world to observe the Chinese system.\"\n\n\"The epidemic is still spreading and the situation is still very grim. To really prevent and control the epidemic, we need to focus on every community and household. In this process, primary-level Party organizations can play an essential role,\" the Times suggested. \"Whether we can resist the attack of the epidemic to a large extent depends on the work of these organizations.\"\n\nThe article, titled \"Response to Virus Shows Strength of Party System,\" applauded the Communist Party for having mobilized and its local cells for having \"formed an effective network to fight the epidemic. For instance, people who come out of the city of Wuhan after the outbreak can be quickly traced and located. These organizations have adopted quite strict quarantine measures to block the input of infectious patients, reducing the risk of local epidemic transmission.\"\n\nThe Party, in other words, is using its extensive surveillance infrastructure -- more commonly used to silence and imprison dissidents -- to track potential virus carriers. Similarly, the Global Times portrays the Party's propaganda mechanisms as beneficial to public health, as local officials in Inner Mongolia \"have made many Putonghua [Mandarin]-Mongolian bilingual short videos\" about the virus.\n\nThe Global Times admitted it is almost entirely unclear if these communist efforts have done anything beneficial for the country, but praised them anyway.\n\n\"It is not yet time to say exactly what role primary-level Party organizations have played in the current fight against the epidemic. However, this may be a good chance for some foreigners and foreign media to learn more about China,\" the newspaper suggested. \"As China is fighting the epidemic, some Western media are badmouthing and blackening the Chinese system. We hope that they can see the efficient operations of China's primary-level Party organizations.\"\n\nThe state newspaper notably omits in its description of the Communist Party as a force for good against the viral outbreak the mounting evidence that the Party and its leader, dictator Xi Jinping, actively conspired to suppress the true number of coronavirus carriers and neglected to properly shut down at-risk events and locations in Wuhan in a timely manner. Reports from within Wuhan suggested in late January that locals were aware of a viral infection spreading as early as mid-December, but had no information regarding it, especially the key detail that the virus causing it was a newly identified one. Health workers have anonymously denounced Wuhan officials for not making them aware, which led to hospitals believing there was no reason to quarantine or otherwise isolate patients with the telltale flu-like symptoms of the new coronavirus. As the virus is now believed to be highly contagious through moisture particles in the area, dozens of health workers and hospital patients are believed to have been infected needlessly due to lack of isolation.\n\nOnce the Chinese government began moving to contain the virus, reports indicated that it was deliberately limiting access to testing kits. Individuals with fevers, coughs, or other potential coronavirus symptoms reported being turned away from hospitals; only patients approved by the Communist Party were allowed to be tested for coronavirus, suggesting that dozens, if not hundreds, of virus carriers were never tested and thus never formed part of the official case tally.\n\nThe rejection of patients at Wuhan hospitals spawned widespread public outrage, perhaps most dramatically illustrated by video published by the South China Morning Post of a man with a fever, rejected for coronavirus testing, coughing in the face of health workers in revenge.\n\nLast week, China's National Health Commission claimed that the number of new cases of the virus per day was declining, suggesting that the outbreak had peaked despite academic and medical experts stating it would take months for the virus to start spreading more slowly. At the time, the Chinese government and the World Health Organization claimed that 6,061 cases of the virus had been documented and 132 people had died.\n\nToday, that number stands at 20,676 cases of confirmed coronavirus infection and 427 deaths, only two of which occurred outside of China (one in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong).", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news",

sacking local officials in Hubei province over the coronavirus outbreak, including two Communist Party officials who left a teenager with cerebral palsy without care for six days while his family was placed in quarantine. The teenager died as a result of this neglect.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported on Thursday that the victim, Yan Cheng, was 16 years of age at the time of his death. The government of Hongan county, where he lived, issued a report on Saturday that said village officials and local doctors \"did not try their hardest to fulfill their duty of care and responsibilities\" for him. The mayor of Huajiahe village and its Communist Party secretary were fired, while a number of other officials were told to expect disciplinary measures.\n\nShortly before Yan Cheng died, his quarantined father Yan Xiaowen was confirmed to be suffering from the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\n\"I have two disabled sons. My older son Yan Cheng has cerebral palsy. He cannot move his body, he cannot speak or look after himself. He has already been at home by himself for six days, with nobody to bathe him or change his clothes and nothing to eat or drink,\" Yan Xiaowen wrote on social media on January 28. His plea for help was later deleted.\n\nAnother post on social media from a support group said Cheng's aunt was struggling to take care of him, but she was too sick to render all of the care he needed. After Cheng died, Chinese internet users expressed fury at the officials who failed to take proper care of him.\n\nHu Lishan, deputy secretary of the Communist Party in the city of Wuhan, apologized on Wednesday for the shortage of treatment options and hospital space.\n\n\"The public has criticized us a lot ... Why? It was because some of our work was not done well. What have we not done well? At present, the contradiction between supply and demand of hospital beds has remained conspicuous,\" Hu conceded at a press conference.\n\n\"Honestly, we are in pain and feel regrettable that a lot of the patients who have been confirmed infected or were suspected to have contracted the coronavirus were unable to receive proper treatment at hospitals. This problem definitely has remained unresolved,\" he added.\n\nThe mayor of Wuhan and its Communist Party chief offered to take responsibility for the virus outbreak and resign last month, prompting speculation they would be the \"obvious fall guys\" for the crisis, as CNN put it.\n\n\"Our names will live in infamy, but as long as it is conducive to the control of the disease and to the people's lives and safety, Comrade Ma Guoqiang and I will bear any responsibility,\" Mayor Zhou Xianwang said, in a spirited audition for fall guy. He was still giving press conferences the following weekend, so he does not seem to have landed the role just yet.\n\nThe Chinese people are not only displeased with the government's handling of the virus outbreak but of the secondary economic crises radiating from it, as quarantines and travel restrictions hammer businesses and leave workers without income.\n\nWhile the central government issues improbably rosy projections about economic resilience and sustained growth, the truth reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP) on Thursday is that small- and medium-sized Chinese businesses are forecasting revenue losses of up to 50 percent in the coming year, while over half of larger firms expect revenue losses of 20 percent or more, and 22 percent of them are already planning to cut payrolls due to the Wuhan virus epidemic.\n\nChinese workers know what that means for their future. The SCMP reported:\n\nOn China's Twitter-like Weibo, a woman living in Shenzhen said her anxiety about her financial future was greater than her worry about contracting the virus. With most people staying home to avoid contracting the virus, her husband, a taxi driver, was no longer able to earn enough money to cover the expense of renting the taxi, let alone make enough to support the family. The rent for their home, though, and the fee for her son's kindergarten tuition were still due, even as food prices had grown more expensive due to supply shortages.\n\n\"Living like this is too difficult. My husband goes out [to work] every day and is worried about getting infected with the virus. Still, he has to go out due to the pressures of life. We didn't return to my hometown for the [Lunar New Year] holiday this year [to stay and] make more money. Now we have to take money from our own [savings] to pay for the taxi rental fee,\" she wrote.\n\nA small-business owner said he lost all his money during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak of 2002-2003, but worked hard for more than a decade to save and was finally able to open a furniture factory in 2018, and his business was beginning to prosper before the coronavirus hit.\n\n\"Do I have to be a loser all my life?\" he lamented.\n\nAnalysts warned the SCMP about the danger of Chinese migrating to urban areas in pursuit of job opportunities, only to find themselves stranded as employers cut back or close down, and coronavirus travel restrictions make it difficult to return home.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"},

in Taiwan.\n\nThe WHO, a United Nations body, refuses to acknowledge the existence of Taiwan or allow it into any of its venues or programs, as the Chinese Communist Party falsely claims it as a rogue province. The WHO has refused to cooperate with the Taiwanese government through the process of responding to the coronavirus crisis that began in China last month and claims to be in contact with Taiwan through the Communist Party, which has no ties to Taipei or control of the island.\n\nAs a result, the WHO published false statistics on the coronavirus outbreak in Taiwan, inflating the actual number of confirmed cases there. It has also referred to Taiwan as \"Taiwan, China,\" which the Taiwanese government has repeatedly condemned as inaccurate and disrespectful.\n\nOn Wednesday, Foreign Minister Wu used the official account of his ministry to address the WHO and demanded to know, \"what's wrong with you\":\n\nThe WHO published a \"situation report\" on the coronavirus outbreak - which at press time is believed to have infected over 28,000 people and killed over 500, nearly all of them in China - on Wednesday that referred to Taiwan as \"Taipei and environs,\" an attempted correction of \"Taiwan, China,\" which prompted global outrage. The day before, the \"Taiwan, China\" case count was listed as 13, three more than the Taiwanese government had actually confirmed. The error is a result of the WHO refusing to communicate with the Taiwanese government. Taiwan's Health and Welfare Ministry referred to the number as \"fake news\" and blamed \"wrong numbers that were provided by China\" for the mistake. Taipei also blamed the WHO for Vietnam and Italy limiting its flights to Taiwan, citing false information from the U.N. organization.\n\nThe ministry account addressed WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus directly on Thursday, demanding a retraction of his effusive praise for China's response to the viral outbreak. China has consistently withheld key information during the outbreak, refusing to acknowledge it for nearly a month in the city of Wuhan, where it originated. The refusal to alert health professionals in the city about the contagious nature of the deadly virus left many exposed to coronavirus patients and resulted in hospitals not adequately isolating potential patients and thus exposing people who were already sick and in a state of compromised health, to the virus.\n\nAdhanom has demanded that the world show \"gratitude and respect\" to the Communist Party for its flawed response to the outbreak.\n\nThe remarks followed a stern rebuke from Foreign Affairs Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou on Thursday, who called the false numbers from the WHO \"absurd.\"\n\n\"We expressed our solemn protest to the WHO after Taiwan's objection with regards to the matter through its representative office in Geneva and several other channels was ignored,\" she said. \"I'd like to ask the WHO, how many times are you going to change Taiwan's name? These are not our correct names. Let me reiterate -- our name is Taiwan, whose formal name is the Republic of China.\"\n\nAt a WHO meeting on Wednesday, the United States urged the group to include Taiwan in the response, insisting that saving lives from a health emergency was not a political endeavor.\n\n\"For the rapidly evolving coronavirus, it is a technical imperative that WHO present visible public health data on Taiwan as an affected area and engage directly with Taiwan public health authorities on actions,\" American Ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva Andrew Bremberg said at a WHO executive board meeting, according to the Taipei Times.\n\n\"I would like to reiterate that Taiwan is part of China, this fact cannot be changed,\" Bremberg's Chinese counterpart at the meeting, Qi Daihai, stated falsely. \"Stop hyping-up about the so-called Taiwan issue. Don't waste our time.\"\n\nThe United States and Japan, which also complained to the WHO about its designation of Taiwan as China, joined eSwatini, Paraguay, and Guatemala, which also demanded Taiwan be included in global outbreak response in a prior WHO meeting. The three are part of the 15 nations that accurately recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state; the list does not include the United States. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen recognized the three states on Twitter.\n\nTsai's vice president, Lai Ching-te, is currently in Washington meeting with congressmen and national security officials. In meeting with the National Security Council on Wednesday, Lai reportedly became the highest-ranking Taiwanese official to meet with them since 1979, when President Jimmy Carter formally established diplomatic relations with the communists in Beijing and abandoned Taipei. Lai also met with a bipartisan group of senators.\n\nTaiwan has implemented travel restrictions and otherwise attempted to prepare to screen travelers for the virus. It has largely relied on the United States to relay key information to identify and treat the virus.\n\nResidents of Wuhan, China, have reported being aware of a disease spreading since December, but Communist Party officials only notified the world on January 20 of the identification of a new virus, 20 days after it shut down a wild meat market suspected of being the source of the virus.",

locate a third of the 1,561 people who travelled to Britain from the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\nAt least 438 people who are still within the incubation period for the coronavirus, are currently unaccounted for in the UK, according to The Times.\n\nEleven British citizens were evacuated from Wuhan last night, joining the 83 who are already in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside, England.\n\nOne of the passengers fell ill during the flight and was separated from the other ten, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\n\"During the flight, one of the passengers started to feel slightly unwell and self-isolated immediately. Upon landing, that passenger remains isolated and was taken to another NHS hospital for tests\" wrote Janelle Holmes, the chief executive of Arrowe Park.\n\nSo far there are two confirmed cases of the deadly virus in Britain. A student at the University of York and his mother, both of whom had travelled from Wuhan, fell ill while staying in a hotel in York. The pair are currently under quarantine at an NHS hospital in Newcastle.\n\nThe university reassured students and parents saying that \"that the risk of infection being passed to others on campus is extremely low\", per The Times.\n\n\"Current information from PHE suggests that the student did not come into contact with anybody on campus whilst they had symptoms, but investigations are ongoing to fully establish this\", said deputy registrar Heidi Fraser-Krauss.\n\nThere are believed to be more than 100,000 Chinese students currently studying in the United Kingdom, and around 30,000 British citizens in China.\n\n\"The challenge that we've got, and the Chinese have got frankly, is to contain the virus but also then to lift out people that want to come back home and we're doing that as

last Friday night in the city of Jingshan, around three hours from Wuhan.\n\nAs he tried to force herself on her, the woman shouted, \"I just returned from Wuhan and have been infected, therefore I am home alone in self-quarantine.\"\n\nThe healthy woman, identified by police as Yi, also pretended to cough as Xiao tried to pin her down by squeezing her neck and covering her mouth. This stunt allegedly frightened Xiao, who stepped back from the assault. He then took 3,080 yuan ($440) in cash before fleeing the scene.\n\nIn a statement posted on Chinese social media, the local police department described the incident in detail, noting how Xiao left his home following an argument with his family in search of things to burgle. The post also included a bizarre cartoon of a man eyeing up someone's valuables through an open window.\n\n\"Xiao was frightened when he heard my claims, and quickly grabbed the bedside phone worth 3,000 yuan and a bag of more than 80 yuan in cash before fleeing the scene,\" the girl told police.\n\nYi contacted the police right away and a manhunt was launched in the town. However, efforts were somewhat hampered by the fact that all locals were wearing face masks to protect themselves from infection. Eventually, Xiao reportedly surrendered himself to police alongside his father and admitted wrongdoing, saying he went out with the intent to commit robbery. He is currently being held in detention.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, Chinese authorities claimed that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus is fast approaching 25,000. Another 494 people have died as a result of the virus, and 980 have made recoveries. There are concerns that China may be lying about the numbers of those infected, as Beijing seeks to protect the country's economic interests as countries around the world urge their citizens to avoid the Chinese mainland.\n\nWith the virus now spreading sporadically around the world, including within the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) last week declared the outbreak as an international health emergency.\n\n\"The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries,\" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on announcing the emergency. \"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_kew@breitbart.com", "name": "Ben Kew", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingshan_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jingshan Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tedros Adhanom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/GettyImages-1197635726.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5489299", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 9}, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 9, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1435299157", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-04", "time": "19:45:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-04T19:45:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-04T18:54:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/02/04/number-coronavirus-cases-passes-20000-427-fatalities-reported/", "title": "Number of Coronavirus Cases Passes 20,000 with 427 Fatalities Reported", "body": "Chinese officials announced the total number of people infected by the Wuhan coronavirus now exceeds 20,000, with 427 fatalities reported worldwide. Officials reported 64 new deaths in China on Tuesday, making it the deadliest day of the epidemic so far.\n\nThe health commission of Hubei, the province at the center of the outbreak, reported 2,345 new infections on Monday, with 1,242 of them in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus was first reported.\n\nThe overall mortality rate for the virus was calculated at 2.1 percent, assuming the data coming from the Chinese government is accurate. However, the mortality rate in Hubei province is much higher at 3.1 percent, and it reached 4.9 percent in Wuhan itself. Most of the people killed by the virus were described as over 60 years of age and usually suffered from another health issue when they contracted the coronavirus.\n\nThe mortality rate from the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic remains much higher, but the Wuhan virus is much more contagious.\n\nDoctors in Wuhan are scrambling to convert civilian structures into treatment centers, including a sports stadium converted into a temporary hospital with 3,400 beds. A new panic-built hospital with 1,000 beds was constructed in only ten days, with another panic-built 1,600-bed hospital due to open on Wednesday.\n\nThe Chinese government is resorting to some unusual measures to control the virus outbreak, including a swarm of drones deployed to monitor citizens who do not follow quarantine rules or observe proper safety measures. The drones are equipped with loudspeakers that can be used to chastise members of the public, which elderly residents of the outbreak zone apparently find weird and confusing.\n\n\"Yes Auntie, this drone is speaking to you. You shouldn't walk about without wearing a mask. You'd better go home, and don't forget to wash your hands,\" a drone told one perplexed older woman in an encounter publicized by Chinese state media. The old woman did as the drone instructed her.\n\nCNN on Tuesday told the story of Dr. Li Wenliang, a Wuhan ophthalmologist punished by the government for accurately warning friends and family in late December that the coronavirus was much more dangerous than authorities were willing to admit. Li was questioned by the police on charges of \"rumor-mongering\" and forced to sign a statement admitting to \"unlawful acts.\" He contracted the virus in January after treating an infected patient, at a time when the Chinese government was still insisting the virus could not be spread by human contact, and has been hospitalized ever since.\n\nEfforts to control the Wuhan virus by restricting travel from China are gaining momentum, even as the World Health Organization struggles in vain to convince airline and tourism companies that travel bans are unnecessary.\n\nHong Kong protesters renewed their demands for a closed border after the first reported coronavirus fatality and first cases of indigenous transmission on their island. Macau on Tuesday ordered its fabled casinos to close for two weeks. Japan is keeping 3,700 passengers quarantined aboard a cruise ship while they are tested for the virus. Taiwan announced that beginning on Friday, foreigners who have visited mainland China in the past 14 days will be denied entry, with an exception for those living in Hong Kong or Macau.\n\nEven Mexico is taking steps to prevent the spread of the Wuhan virus despite having no confirmed cases to date. Over the weekend, the Uber ride-sharing service suspended 240 user accounts in Mexico City to prevent the spread of the virus after learning a potentially infected individual used Uber after arriving from Los Angeles last month.\n\nChinese dictator Xi Jinping held a special meeting of the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee on Monday and emerged to call for a more aggressive anti-virus strategy, making only his second public appearance since the crisis began.\n\nChinese state media quoted Xi describing the coronavirus epidemic as \"a major test of China's system and capacity for governance,\" calling on officials to obey orders from the central government without letting \"bureaucratism and the practice of formalities for formalities' sake\" get in the way.\n\n\"Those who disobey the unified command or shirk off responsibilities will be punished,\" he warned.\n\nXi's more aggressive posture could be an effort to shore up his political standing in China as criticism mounts of his hands-off approach. Residents trapped in the quarantine zone are increasingly bold in accusing Xi of cowardice and prioritizing his political standing above effectively dealing with the crisis. Even his Monday emergency session was viewed with skepticism as a purely political exercise focused primarily on setting up scapegoats and fall guys - hence the lectures about punishment waiting for disobedient local officials and paralyzed bureaucrats.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name": "John

Without a Healthcare System", "body": "The National Assembly of Venezuela - the last remaining democratically elected branch of government - approved a plan on Tuesday to help with coronavirus awareness and distribute a manual on how to contain the outbreak if it reaches the Latin American country.\n\nThanks to the socialist regime of dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela has deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party, which has invested millions in keeping him in power. China is responsible for building a social surveillance system known as the \"Fatherland card\" for Maduro to help track dissidents and deny them food and basic goods. China has also attempted to get Venezuela to sign onto its \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" a sprawling international bid for Beijing to build and control most of the world's transportation infrastructure, but Caracas' ongoing economic crisis has made it impossible for Maduro to sign onto any major project.\n\nThe ties between the Chinese Communist Party and Maduro mean that travel between the two countries occurs regularly, potentially exposing Venezuela to the ongoing outbreak of a newly documented coronavirus in China. The virus, originating in the central city of Wuhan, has infected over 20,000 people and killed nearly 500 since the Communist Party announced the discovery of the virus on January 20.\n\nGiven the potential of a traveler from China bringing the virus into Venezuela - and the state of abandon and collapse that the Venezuelan healthcare system currently finds itself in - the National Assembly approved a measure that would create a protocol for how to handle a potential coronavirus case independent of the Maduro regime.\n\n\"This manual will be distributed in health centers, customs checkpoints, the Maiquet\u00eda International Airport, so that public officials will know what they are facing and what protection they should use,\" Jos\u00e9 Manuel Olivares, a National Assembly member in exile who spearheaded the effort, said after it passed.\n\n\"70 percent of hospitals in the country don't have water and the primary coronavirus prevention measure is washing one's hands,\" the lawmaker added. \"89 percent of hospitals report electricity interruptions and only 49 percent of these institutions have emergency rooms open. 2,602 Venezuelans died in the country because there were no medical supplies to tend to trauma.\"\n\n\"The precarious health situation in the country make us require these alerts because there is the possibility of coronavirus reaching Venezuela,\" he concluded.\n\nThe novel coronavirus is highly contagious through moisture particles ejected while coughing, breathing, or sneezing. Experts believe that it may be contagious even before a carrier has visible symptoms, which tend to include fever, coughing, and body aches. Washing hands, wearing face masks, and staying away from crowded areas are pivotal measures to control the outbreak.\n\nAnother lawmaker, Jos\u00e9 Trujillo, noted on Tuesday that, even if the coronavirus outbreak had reached the country, it would be impossible for Venezuela to know because hospitals do not have testing kits. The World Health Organization (WHO) is organizing the global response; as a United Nations body, it incorrectly identified Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the nation's head of state, excluding legitimate President Juan Guaid\u00f3. It remains unclear how the WHO would be able to distribute humanitarian aid or testing supplies in Venezuela given that it does not recognize Guaid\u00f3 and Maduro's regime refuses to acknowledge that the country has needed humanitarian aid for years.\n\n\"In Venezuela, we don't even have a way to test [someone] to detect coronavirus,\" Trujillo noted. \"Prevention is key and in this country it is almost impossible to do it. International organizations should send aid to deal with this virus and avoid a tragedy.\"\n\nHe added, \"Venezuela will not escape the threat because we have alliances with Asian nations and the virus lives for 14 days before being detected [in someone's body], so it can reach the country. The virus is a genetic alteration, but the truth isn't being told to the world.\"\n\nMaduro's regime has downplayed that threat, claiming that it has implemented the necessary safeguards to prevent the virus from ravaging the country. Maduro's \"health minister\" Carlos Alvarado said on Monday that the WHO's subgroup in the region, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), would be sending testing kits to Venezuela this week. He added that Venezuela has requested that other countries identify coronavirus patients before they board planes to the country. He insisted the regime had yet to identify a coronavirus case in Venezuela.\n\nChina's state-run news service Xinhua highlighted Maduro expressing solidarity with the Communist Party on the outbreak.\n\n\"The entire world looks on in awe at the energetic determination with which the Chinese government has met the sanitary protocols recommended by international organizations specialized in health to control the propagation of the virus,\" a statement from Maduro this week read.\n\nThe Venezuelan Red Cross has expressed panic at Maduro's coronavirus preparedness. Last week, the president of the organization, Mario Villarroel, warned that \"we are not ready to fully combat this disease,\" noting the dire state of Venezuela's socialist healthcare system.\n\n\"We are calling for the prevention of the coronavirus. We are not ready to fully combat this disease. This is something that the Health Ministry has to prepare. Neither the medicines nor the treatment necessary are here,\" Villarroel said.\n\nVenezuela's healthcare system, which Maduro boasts is a prime example of government-run health care and Venezuela's government is constitutionally mandated to run, deals regularly with chronic shortages of medicine, electricity, and water. Amputations became increasingly common as the economy began to rot under Maduro in 2014, as antibiotics ran short, and nearly every medicine on the WHO's list of necessary, basic medicines is no longer available. Vaccines are also in short supply, resulting in outbreaks of diseases Venezuela had eradicated before socialism, like malaria, measles, and diptheria. Patients living with chronic diseases like diabetes or HIV have little to no access to necessary treatment.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":

To ensure that no one violates the 14-day isolation period and puts others in the population at risk, officials will use wristbands to monitor their location.\n\nThe trackers will be tied to the wearer's smartphone via Bluetooth technology. The phone's GPS technology will provide the person's location - if the phone leaves the permitted area, or if the wristband reaches more than a 20-meter distance away from the phone, the government will consider the wearer in breach of the quarantine. Destroying the wristband or taking it off will also count as breaches.\n\nHong Kong's Chief Information Officer Victor Lam debuted the wristbands in a press conference Monday, where he warned that violations found with the wristband could result in up to a six-month prison term or fined the equivalent of U.S. $644. He emphasized that the tags themselves do not have GPS technology, so the government will not monitor the wearer's every move, providing a minimum of privacy. He also noted that the government will soon count on another 1,000 wristbands to use similarly.\n\nThe move is part of a growing response to the coronavirus outbreak currently ravaging China and threatening the rest of the world. The Chinese government revealed on January 20 - nearly a month after secretly alerting the World Health Organization (WHO) - that it had identified a never-before-seen coronavirus spreading in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. China shut down the wild meat market where the virus is believed to have originated on January 1, and local officials instituted a lockdown in Wuhan, preventing entry or exit and stopping mass transit, a week after the announcement of the new virus.\n\nHong Kong has identified 15 cases of novel coronavirus as of Monday, according to the Asian outlet Coconuts. The city has identified potentially hundreds of cases, increasingly running out of spaces to isolate them and prevent the outbreak from growing, hence the introduction of at-home measures.\n\nIsolation is especially important in light of authorities warning on Sunday that they may have identified a case of coronavirus passed from human to human within Hong Kong - rather than the case of a person returning from Wuhan already carrying it.\n\n\"Hong Kong can become another Wuhan,\" Yuen Kwok-yung, a University of Hong Kong microbiologist, said on Sunday, according to local broadcaster RTHK. Yuen suggested increased border controls to keep carriers out of the city, noting that Guangdong, the Chinese province that borders Hong Kong, is one of the most affected by the outbreak.\n\nThe individual identified as a potential human-to-human case is a patient that has reportedly not traveled outside Hong Kong within a time frame that would have made it possible to get the virus from someone abroad.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has limited the flow of travelers from China, but refused to shut down the border completely, triggering widespread protests and a general strike of Hong Kong healthcare workers at a pivotal time in fighting the outbreak. Lam has taken to shutting border crossings piecemeal, and on Monday announced that all but three crossings will remain open. One of them is Hong Kong's international airport, where government officials insist they have installed enough security measures to catch incoming cases.\n\nLam cited a \"genuine and legitimate\" need by many in Hong Kong to travel into and out of China on a regular basis for leaving the border crossings open.\n\nMany in Hong Kong, already protesting Lam's close ties to the Communist Party of China for half a year before the outbreak began, have not accepted her explanation. On Monday, RTHK reported that dozens of Hong Kong residents took to the streets during their lunch breaks from work to demand a complete closure of Hong Kong's borders to China. The crowd, some chanting \"close the border, say no to China,\" sang Hong Kong democracy protest albums and demanded an end to the closures until police threatened them with potential action in light of them being \"suspected of taking part in an unlawful assembly,\" RTHK noted.\n\nAlso on Monday, thousands of healthcare workers began their strike against the government. As they are the first to interact with potential coronavirus cases, an open border is riskiest for them.\n\n\"If there is no full border closure, there won't be enough manpower, protective equipment, or isolation rooms, to combat the outbreak\", Winnie Yu, the chairman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, told reporters. The first day of striking would only include non-essential healthcare workers, though that may change in the near future.\n\n\"We reiterate... we hospital staff are being forced into taking this desperate move of taking industrial action by those in power,\" Yu said. \"We welcome the government at any time, to join in open talks with the Hospital Authority to give concrete responses to our demands, to resolve this current impasse.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com", "name": "Frances

"Russia announced on Tuesday that it will establish a quarantine zone in Siberia for planeloads of Russian nationals evacuated from China's Hubei province, epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nRussia closed its 2,600-mile land border with China last week, before any confirmed cases of coronavirus infection had been reported in Russia. Russia's first cases of the coronavirus, in the form of two Chinese citizens who were quickly isolated, were detected last Friday.\n\nOn Monday, the Russians halted passenger trains to China, severely limited air travel, and announced they would deport any foreign nationals who tested positive for the virus. Tuesday brought school closings and the cancellation of public events in regions close to China, depicted largely as efforts to control another flu outbreak that has nothing to do with the Wuhan virus.\n\nThe Russian government advised people to wear masks on public transportation to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, then told them not to buy too many masks because heavy demand could lead to shortages.\n\nPlans were laid out to send two military aircraft to recover about 130 Russians trapped in Hubei province after the Chinese government imposed a lockdown. The evacuees will be kept at an observation facility in the Tyumen region of Siberia for 14 days, which is generally accepted as the length of time a person who contracts the Wuhan virus can go without displaying symptoms.\n\nTyumen is a regional administrative center and the oldest Russian city in Siberia, located at the intersection of river travel and the Trans-Siberian Railroad.

Coronavirus-Infected Residents in Mass Quarantine Camps", "body": "The Chinese government announced a new policy in Wuhan Friday to isolate individuals testing positive for the novel coronavirus ravaging the city in what the New York Times is calling \"quarantine camps.\"\n\nThe senior Chinese official tasked with coronavirus response reportedly ordered Wuhan authorities to \"set up a 24-hour duty system\" to prevent further spread of the deadly coronavirus.\n\n\"During these wartime conditions, there must be no deserters,\" Sun Chunlan said, \"or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever.\"\n\nThe city has raced to comply with the order, erecting makeshift \"mass quarantine shelters,\" including one in a sports stadium, an exhibition center, and a building complex.\n\nWuhan is a city of 11 million people. It has already been on \"lockdown\" - a shutdown of public transportation, flights, and most usage of roads in and out of the city - for over a week to prevent the virus from spreading in the rest of the country. Local officials in Wuhan enacted the lockdown after an estimated five million people had left the city for the Lunar New Year holiday, according to the city's mayor, so it is not clear if the measures have successfully stopped the virus from spreading. All 31 Chinese provinces have documented coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Wuhan residents on Weibo, the highly censored but legal Chinese social media platform, have denounced the camps as frigid and in \"very poor condition.\"\n\n\"Doctors and nurses were not seen to be taking note of symptoms and distributing medicine,\" a Weibo post claimed.\n\nWuhan's lockdown has already caused a shortage of testing kits, hospital beds, and vital medical supplies. Residents have been forced to walk the streets to reach hospitals, but many have been turned away without so much as a test for the virus ravaging the isolated city.\n\nThe building of camps in another region of China may prove alarming to human rights activists that have already been denouncing the Communist Party for years for its use of concentration camps to eliminate the existence of Muslims, particularly ethnic Uyghur Muslims, in far-west Xinjiang province -- where coronavirus statistics are a \"state secret.\" The Pentagon has estimated that as many as three million people are currently trapped in concentration camps in Xinjiang for being Muslims or otherwise threats to the Han supremacist communist state.

\"hate\" and racism against Chinese people by taking appropriate measures to identify and contain individuals carrying the virus.\n\nThe new form of coronavirus is believed to have originated at a wild meat market in Wuhan, central China, a city of 11 million people, in December. Beijing publicly announced the discovery of the new virus on January 20 and has repeatedly claimed to have the situation under control, despite the virus rapidly spreading to the country's every province and throughout the world.\n\nThe novel coronavirus creates flu-like symptoms that can result in pneumonia and death. As of Wednesday, the Chinese government and World Health Organization (WHO) have identified 24,629 coronavirus cases worldwide and 492 deaths, nearly all of them in China. The Communist Party's secrecy and reports from health workers in Wuhan of hospitals refusing to test symptomatic patients for coronavirus indicate the available numbers are significantly lower than the true number of cases.\n\nThese suspicions have in part led to travel restrictions around the world for Chinese citizens, though more commonly to restrictions against foreign nationals who have been to China. In America, President Donald Trump announced that any foreign citizen who has visited China in the past 14 days would not be allowed to enter the country. Other countries have adopted simialr measures.\n\nThe Global Times described these measures on Tuesday as \"disturbing developments in some corners of the world which are not only counterproductive to containing the virus, but also amount to discrimination and even racism against Chinese nationals and overseas Chinese.\"\n\n\"Despite the World Health Organization's recommendation against limiting trade and travel, some governments have banned Chinese nationals from entering their borders,\" the Times noted, and continued:\n\nWithout proper knowledge of the virus, some foreign individuals and groups have spread rumors and conspiracy theories with racist connotations about China, and have discriminated against Chinese nationals by barring them from stores, restaurants and other establishments.\n\n\"While necessary measures taken by foreign governments, groups and individuals to protect themselves from the virus are understandable, China should be alarmed by any malicious actions and prepare to take countermeasures if necessary,\" the newspaper concluded, going on to blame America for setting \"a poor example for other countries.\"\n\n\"It is crucial that China is aware of the importance of protecting its national interests and citizens overseas and takes concrete steps to respond by rewarding good deeds and punishing ill-intentioned actions,\" the state propaganda outlet declared.\n\nThe article did not specify the punishment for \"malicious actions,\" nor did it define any such actions worth punishing.\n\nIn another article, the Global Times claimed that Western media was \"fueling ... racist sentiment against the Chinese\" by \"smearing China's system,\" noting the extreme secrecy and shortage of key medical supplies that has hindered the response since China revealed the existence of the virus.\n\n\"As China ascends as a major power, developing countries view China with both admiration and caution, while developed ones, especially those in the West, viewing it through critical lens,\" the article claimed. \"If China were to become a country accepted by the West, it has to be subject to the West ideologically, plus, its national strength cannot unnerve the Western countries. But this is not the path China has chosen.\"\n\nThe adversarial tenor of the articles match what much of English-language Chinese propaganda has been publishing in the past two weeks as the outbreak has grown. The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, declared that \"hatovirus\" - the virus of racism against Chinese people - is more dangerous than the coronavirus that has killed nearly 500 people. On Wednesday, the People's Daily condemned Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross for various comments about China; the attack on Pompeo was particularly confusing because his remark, that China is a top global threat, was about the spread of surveillance technology through Huawei. It then went on to cite an \"expert\" who claimed that guns, not coronavirus, were the real threat to Americans.\n\n\"While there will be tests along the way, including this new coronavirus outbreak, the ultimate victory must be China's,\" the People's Daily concluded. \"To borrow a phrase, the only thing to fear is fear itself. As for the American politicians with evil intentions, time will see their defeat, and history will record their ugliness.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

"body": "Governments across Asia are increasing censorship efforts and media controls to suppress \"fake news\" about the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic, a problem the World Health Organization (WHO) also expressed concerns about on Tuesday.\n\nFree speech advocates are worried about rising censorship levels in a region that already had serious problems with authoritarianism.\n\nWHO Global Infections Hazard Preparedness director Sylvie Briand said on Tuesday that misinformation about the epidemic could spread panic and interfere with serious efforts to control the coronavirus.\n\n\"A few centuries ago, this phenomenon existed as well. But at that time there was no social media and so the information was spreading as well, but much slower than now. Now, the information is spreading very fast and is amplified immediately in every corner of the world, basically. This speed is very difficult to address in a timely manner,\" Briand told Voice of America News.\n\n\"I think it is a challenge of the 21st century because we are all beneficiaries of those extremely intense and fast communications, but also we could be the victims of it,\" she said, arguing that efforts to suppress false information during a fast-moving crisis are not \"censorship\" as the term is traditionally understood.\n\nThe big problem, as always, is defining \"fake news\" and setting reasonable terms for refuting it. Every censorship regime in the world, including hardcore speech control fanatics like the Communist Chinese, justifies authoritarian speech restrictions as a crusade against disinformation. \"Fake news\" is a concept that can be easily stretched to include political dissent and accurate information the regime disapproves of.\n\nIn the case of the Wuhan coronavirus, the Chinese government deserves much of the blame for the atmosphere of paranoia and disinformation, since it suppressed valid lifesaving information about the virus for so long, and is widely suspected of continuing to do so.\n\nReuters on Tuesday noted censorship crusades flaring up across Asia, with quite a few arrests:\n\nAt least 16 people have been arrested over coronavirus posts in Malaysia, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong, while Singapore has used its controversial new \"fake news\" law, POFMA, to force media outlets and social media users to carry government warnings on their posts and articles saying they contain falsehoods.\n\n\"Fortunately, we now have POFMA to deal with these fake news,\" said Lawrence Wong, one of the ministers heading a Singapore government task force to halt the spread of the virus.\n\n[...]\n\nAt least five people were arrested and released on bail in India's southwestern state of Kerala over WhatsApp messages, said Aadhithya R, District Police Chief of Thrissur. Six people were arrested in Malaysia on suspicion of spreading false news.\n\nIn Vietnam, where an army of cyber-censors tracks social media comment for the communist government, at least nine people have been fined and three celebrities asked to explain their actions over posts about coronavirus.\n\nThailand hailed the success of an \"anti-fake news center\" it set up last year. Dozens of staff reviewed nearly 7,600 posts in four days from Jan. 25 - leading to 22 posts being highlighted as false on its website and two arrests under computer crimes laws.\n\n\"The anti-fake news center is working intensively to verify these rumors and communicating truth to the people,\" said Digital Minister Puttipong Punnakanta.\n\nTaiwan and South Korea are also taking steps to block misinformation while, in the United States, Facebook has announced plans to remove posts that spread false information about the virus.\n\nAs Reuters pointed out, the first major act of coronavirus-related speech control was of course perpetrated by China, which arrested eight people for \"spreading rumors\" early in the outbreak but has since changed course and hailed the detainees as heroes for trying to sound an early warning about the Wuhan epidemic.\n\nCritics of coronavirus censorship warned that not only is speech control problematic from the standpoint of human rights and individual liberty, but it can interfere with the spread of information that can help people at risk of the disease. The eight Wuhan detainees would serve as an example since some of the material they circulated was incorrect - some of them thought SARS was making a comeback - but they were essentially right that a dangerous epidemic was spreading.\n\nThe MIT Technology Review on Sunday looked at coronavirus censorship from the other direction, telling the story of Chinese citizens working to bypass government news blackouts with crowdsourced campaigns. Some of these operations overlap with networks created to support the Hong Kong protest movement, which has produced a generation of activists who know how to get around China's notorious Internet blockades.\n\nParticipants in the project noted that Chinese censors are aggressively blocking posts that criticize or embarrass the government, whether or not the statements they make about the Wuhan virus are accurate. They also expressed healthy skepticism of the more dramatic \"underground videos\" of people collapsing in the streets of Wuhan.\n\nThe L.A. Times on Monday related the ordeal of a Wuhan resident named Fang Bin, an aspiring \"citizen journalist\" who found himself dragged off in the middle of the night by a squad of police in hazmat suits because he posted videos of corpses at public hospitals.\n\nFang was treated like a potential plague carrier even though he was perfectly healthy and was never interviewed by a doctor. His interrogators accused him of being a mercenary subversive paid by foreigners to make videos embarrassing to the Chinese government. At no point was the authenticity of his videos seriously challenged.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com",

Bad, and the Ugly", "body": "Dr. Tom Price, former U.S. Secretary of HHS, writes for Fox News, breaking down his analysis of the novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) into the good (such as localization of the source), the bad (a vaccine won't be available for many months), and the ugly (China):\n\nThe Good\n\nSo far there have been only eight cases of infection in the U.S. by this new bug It appears that all but one of those have occurred in people who had traveled to Wuhan, China before coming to the states and therefore contracted their illness outside of our borders. The spouse of one of these patients - who had not traveled to China - contracted the disease, which is evidence for the human to human transmission. This raises the greatest concern of all. However, it appears that close contact with an infected person is needed in order to become infected yourself.\n\n. . .\n\nThe Bad\n\nIn addition, because viruses are not able to be treated with antibiotics, the care available for those infected is primarily supportive. Treatment consists of mitigating the symptoms with fluids, anti-viral agents and medications for fever and aches. A vaccine is the best form of care to stop the spread and prevent greater numbers of infections from occurring or spreading. With a new virus, however, developing a vaccine that is safe and effective takes some time. The gene sequence of 2019-nCoV was determined very quickly and the CDC has made that information available to all so that manufacturers can work as rapidly as possible to develop that new vaccine. It is likely that we'll not have this protection available until late summer or early fall at the very earliest.\n\nThe Ugly\n\n. . .\n\nChina, however, is China. If the past is prologue, there is little confidence that China is sharing all the needed information, especially the number of cases and deaths.

Three previous tests had indicated he did not carry the Wuhan virus, but the fourth test confirmed he did.\n\nThe South China Morning Post (SCMP) on Monday quoted China's health commission stating that up to three tests are often needed to confirm the presence of the Wuhan virus in patients. A dismaying number of Chinese travelers have been arriving at airports around the world with Wuhan infections that are caught during airport screening for the infection.\n\nThe patient described by the SCMP is a railroad worker who lives in Tianjin, a huge city close to Beijing. A total of 28 coronavirus cases have now been detected in Tianjin. The man was reportedly quarantined in his home after he first checked into a local hospital with a fever on January 19, even though the first tests for the Wuhan virus came back negative, thus minimizing his contact with other people.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the coronavirus has been detected in 17,491 patients and is believed responsible for 362 deaths. The SARS outbreak of 2002-2003, to which the Wuhan virus is frequently compared, infected 5,327 people in mainland China and killed 349 of them. As these numbers suggest, the Wuhan virus is much more infectious than SARS but also much less likely to kill its victims.\n\nThe Wuhan virus is particularly insidious because infected people can be contagious for up to two weeks without displaying any outward symptoms. The SCMP recounted the case of a German businessman who got sick on a flight back from China, seemingly recovered after a few days, but then tested positive for the Wuhan virus after one of the people he met with in China grew ill and tested positive.\n\nWired reported on Saturday that epidemiologists are worried about \"super-spreaders,\" people who carry the Wuhan virus and can infect others while going for exceptionally long periods without experiencing any sign of illness. Super-spreading is difficult to monitor because the spreaders do not feel sick, so they might not seek medical treatment, making it difficult to trace chains of infection back to them. A larger number of people who carry the virus without any symptoms of illness could be one reason why the Wuhan virus is spreading so much more rapidly than SARS.\n\nPolitics could be another reason. Al-Jazeera noted on Monday that people in Wuhan are furious at the Chinese government for downplaying the severity of the viral outbreak and giving false assurances that the situation was under control.\n\nAs recently as last week, incredulous residents of Wuhan reported seeing propaganda from the Chinese Communist Party that hailed the government for a \"transparent and swift\" response that \"highly impressed\" international observers and supposedly contained the epidemic. Angry people in the outbreak area used social media to complain about slow medical responses, overwhelmed hospitals, and a media blackout that lasted until just a few days before the entire province was placed on lockdown.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name": "John Hayward", "type": "author",

"title": "Hong Kong Health Workers Strike as Government Refuses to Close Border", "body": "Hong Kong healthcare workers launched a five-day strike as threatened on Monday to protest their government's refusal to completely seal the border with China until the coronavirus epidemic is under control.\n\nHong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam responded by announcing more travel restrictions, closing down all land crossings except the bridges to Shenzhen and Zhuhai.\n\nLam implemented increasing travel restrictions as protests from both the medical community and the general public intensified. On Monday, she announced the border checkpoints at Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau, as well as the port of Huang Gang and the Hong Kong-Macau ferry. Six other checkpoints were closed last week.\n\nThis leaves only the Shenzhen Bay Bridge and the bridge connecting Hong Kong to Zhuhai and Macau still in operation, but critics remain adamant on a complete shutdown of the border, so hospital workers went on strike as planned.\n\nLam said the four checkpoints shuttered on Monday were not closed in response to what she deemed \"political\" threats and \"extreme action\" from protesters.\n\n\"These measures are consistent with the initiatives rolled out earlier. They are completely irrelevant to the strike,\" she said at a press conference on Monday.\n\nLam insisted it would be \"inappropriate and impractical\" to completely close the border with China as demanded by protesters, citing recommendations against a travel ban by the World Health Organization (WHO), whose praise the Chinese Communist Party enthusiastically cites at every opportunity.\n\nLam decided not to attend a meeting between representatives of the HAEA and Hong Kong's Hospital Authority over the weekend, angering the union and causing negotiations to break down.\n\nHong Kong's new Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) said 2,500 of its roughly 18,000 members participated in the strike on day one. Hundreds of them demonstrated outside hospitals, while organizers said a march would be held in the afternoon.\n\nThe HAEA posted a list of five demands, echoing the storied Five Demands of the massive Hong Kong protest movement - an homage that probably will not amuse anyone in Carrie Lam's administration.\n\nThe five HAEA demands are for Lam's government to seal the border with China, distribute medical masks to the public, ensure healthcare workers have the supplies they need, establish isolation wards for Wuhan virus patients, and promise not to retaliate against striking medical workers.\n\n\"If there is no full border closure, there won't be enough manpower, protective equipment, or isolation rooms, to combat the outbreak,\" HAEA chairwoman Winnie Yu warned on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the union, the first round of striking employees are mostly \"non-essential\" staff, but a second and larger phase of walkouts will begin if the group's demands are not met by Monday night, including frontline doctors and nurses. The Hospital Authority warned the strike could cause many scheduled procedures to be postponed but should not interfere with emergency services.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType":

"body": "The UK Foreign Office has issued a warning to all British citizens currently within China to leave the communist nation, as the official death toll of the deadly coronavirus has reached 425, with an additional 20,000 estimated cases.\n\nThe British government, which previously advised against all but essential travel to China, has now warned all of the estimated 30,000 Britons currently in China to leave the country if they are able to.\n\n\"We now advise British nationals in China to leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus,\" said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab per the BBC.\n\n\"Where there are still British nationals in Hubei province who wish to be evacuated, we will continue to work around the clock to facilitate this,\" he

The elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be at heightened risk,\" Raab warned.\n\nAccording to the BBC's China correspondent, Robin Brant, the updated advice from the Foreign Office was \"not because we've seen a sudden increase in the severity of the outbreak of the virus\", but rather due to increased difficulties in travelling from China and that the Foreign Office is organising its \"last flight\" evacuation from Wuhan.\n\nLast week the UK evacuated 94 citizens, one of whom fell ill on the flight back to the UK from Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak of the coronavirus.\n\nThere are currently two confirmed cases of the deadly virus in the UK, a student at the University of York and his mother, both of whom recently travelled from Wuhan.\n\nThe UK is still trying to locate 239 people who travelled to the UK from Wuhan before the city was quarantined. The travellers are still believed to be within the incubation period of the virus, which lasts between two and 14 days.\n\nOn Monday, 57 people died in China, marking the deadliest day since the virus was discovered, prompting the Chinese Communist Party to admit that there were \"shortcomings and difficulties\" in its handling of the epidemic.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kurt_zindulka@breitbart.com", "name": "Kurt Zindulka", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foreign and Commonwealth Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Raab", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Raab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incubation period"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of China"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 20}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/coronavirus-1.png", "eventUri": "eng-5486625", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 5}, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 5, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1434221653", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-04", "time": "01:39:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-04T01:39:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-04T01:39:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/news/11-coronavirus-cases-in-u-s-2nd-person-to-person-transmission-confirmed/", "title": "11 coronavirus cases in U.S., 2nd person-to-person transmission confirmed - Breitbart", "body": "Feb. 3 (UPI) -- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials Monday revealed that the total number of confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States has risen to 11.\n\nThe new cases include a Massachusetts resident and four Californians. Four of the five had traveled to Wuhan, China -- epicenter for the outbreak of the virus, known as 2019 n-CoV -- while the fifth involved a \"close contact\" with one of the travelers.\n\nThat last case is the second involving person-to-person transmission that has been confirmed in the United States, officials.\n\nSo far, 167 Americans who have undergone screening for the virus have tested negative, while results are pending on an additional 82, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, said at a press briefing.\n\nAlthough Messonnier noted that the 11 confirmed cases are being monitored by public health officials in the affected states, she said reports to the CDC so far have suggested that \"a few of them\" are suffering from \"mild illness,\" while others have more severe disease.\n\n\"There have been ups and downs in the courses\" of a few of these patients, and \"some have required oxygen,\" she added.\n\nOn Monday, Messonnier also responded to criticism from leaders in China and from the World Health Organization, both of which have called into question the merits of measures the U.S. government put into place over the weekend. The moves included restricting travel to and from China and implementing mandatory quarantining for some foreign travelers coming into the country.\n\nShe emphasized that the government's response has been \"science-based,\" while acknowledging that this is an \"unprecedented situation and because it is moving so quickly, we don't have the information base we want.\" She added that the U.S. is taking \"aggressive measures. We are preparing as if this is the next pandemic. We hope that strong measures now may blunt the impact on the United States.\"\n\nThe primary concern of health officials at this point is emerging data suggesting that those sickened with 2019 n-CoV may be able to pass along the virus to others even before they experience symptoms themselves.\n\nScreening of travelers from mainland China continues at 11 U.S. airports this week, and quarantine measures for each are still being determined, the CDC said. Quarantined travelers could be housed at military bases, like those 195 Americans evacuated last week from Hubei province in China, or at hospitals or even hotels.\n\nMessonnier said the CDC and other agencies are also \"putting a lot of resources into finding new infections\" both here and abroad. She noted that the virus has been isolated, and samples have been forwarded to the National Institutes of Health to further research efforts into potential vaccines and drug treatments.\n\nThe CDC has also developed an RRT-PCR test that can successfully diagnose 2019 n-CoV, and it has applied for an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration so that the protocol can be distributed to laboratories in the 50 states as well as the agency's international partners.\n\nAlthough the test is accurate, Messonnier said, people who may have tested negatively on initial screening could still get sick, because the virus may remain undetectable for a time following transmission. As a result, those placed in quarantine may need to be tested multiple times.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Union", "body": "Florida's senators will use their guest spots at the State of the Union Tuesday night to highlight activists fighting against the repressive Chinese Communist Party. Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) has invited Nathan Law, founder of one of Hong Kong's most influential pro-democracy groups; Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) invited Uyghur human rights advocate Rushan Abbas.\n\nMembers of Congress traditionally invite individuals as guests to accompany them to the State of the Union to highlight causes near to them. President Donald Trump will also highlight several distinguished guests of his during the speech.\n\nNathan Law, the 26-year-old founder of the anti-communist group Demosisto, acknowledged his invitation to the address on Twitter. Law has been actively protesting China's increasingly belligerent attempts to shut down the traditional freedoms common in Hong Kong -- and absent in China -- since 2013, when he was 20 years old, and was elected to the Hong Kong legislature three years later, the youngest elected lawmaker in Hong Kong history. The Beijing-controlled Hong Kong government swiftly moved to remove him from power, however. He is currently the co-leader of Demosisto alongside fellow founder and Hong Kong democracy leader Joshua Wong and a graduate student at Yale University, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\n\"Hong Kong is crucial - it represents the spirit of freedom and democracy in the era of democratic recession,\" Law noted on Twitter, announcing his presence at the State of the Union address. \"The case of Hong Kong continues to remind us how precious freedom is. I hope that the President could be vigilant to China's expansionist aggression and uphold the liberal values in his speech.\"\n\n\"I am honored to have Nathan as my guest,\" Scott said in a statement. \"Nathan is an inspiration in the fight for freedom and democracy, and he has sent a powerful message to Communist China that the people of Hong Kong will not back down or be silenced.\"\n\nHong Kong has endured over six months of protests against the Chinese communist regime, generally demanding more autonomy but specifically urging the government to cede to four demands: freedom for political prisoners, the right to directly elect all lawmakers, an investigation into police brutality, and an end to calling peaceful protesters \"rioters.\" The protests began on the back of a fifth demand, which the government conceded: the full withdrawal of a proposed bill that would have allowed the government to extradite anyone Chinese Communist Party officials accused of violating Chinese law into the Chinese prison system. Unlike Hong Kong, China does not respect the right to free speech and often imprisons pro-democracy activists, religious minorities, and human rights lawyers for \"crimes\" such as \"disturbing the public order.\" The law the protest movement successfully fought would have applied to all persons present in Hong Kong, not just Hong Kong residents.\n\nThe ongoing Hong Kong democracy movement routinely attracts tens of thousands, and sometimes millions, to near-weekly protests. Hong Kong residents have recently limited public assemblies in the face of the growing novel coronavirus outbreak originating in central China, which has killed one person in Hong Kong so far.\n\nThe U.S. Congress, through the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, nominated the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement for a Nobel Peace Prize in an official letter to the nominating committee on Monday.\n\n\"The decision to nominate the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize was based on the fact that this year's protests were 'impressively organized and coherent, yet notably leaderless and flexible,'\" the commission said in a statement. \"The Commissioners urged the Nobel Peace Prize committee to recognize the 'countless and often anonymous individuals [who] risked their lives, their health, their jobs, and their education to support a better future for Hong Kong.'\"\n\nWhile Scott's guest will highlight the fight against communism in Hong Kong, Rubio's will highlight the ongoing plight of China's ethnic Uyghurs, a majority Muslim ethnic group indigenous to far-west Xinjiang, China. The Communist Party, dominated by China's Han ethnic majority, has waged an unceasing campaign to eliminate the existence of Uyghurs, primarily through the use of concentration camps to indoctrinate, enslave, sterilize, and kill them. Estimates of the number of Uyghurs -- and Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims minorities in Xinjiang -- in these camps extends into the millions.\n\nRubio's guest, Rushan Abbas, began her career of activism as a student at Xinjiang University in the 1980s and has since founded the Campaign for Uyghurs, a humanitarian activist group.\n\n\"Rushan is a leading voice in the defense of Uyghurs' human rights. As a result of her work, her sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was believed to have been forcibly disappeared and detained in a camp in Xinjiang,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"As the Founder and Executive Director of Campaign for Uyghurs, Rushan has tirelessly raised awareness of the atrocities taking place in Xinjiang at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.\"\n\nAbbas thanked Rubio in her own statement on Twitter, describing the mass incarceration, killing, and erasure of Uyghurs and their culture in China as a \"genocide.\"\n\nPresident Trump is expected to discuss his China policy in his speech tonight, among a wide variety of topics including border security, the war in Afghanistan, paid family leave, and healthcare. According to NPR, the White House has revealed two of the guests President Trump will highlight during the address: \"Tony Rankins, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan who got a job working on a project in an Opportunity Zone in Cincinnati; and Raul Ortiz, the deputy chief of U.S. Border Patrol.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":
