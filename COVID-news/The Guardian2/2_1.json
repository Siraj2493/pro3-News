Two consecutive negative tests are required before a patient may be discharged.\n\n\"This shows the novel coronavirus is not uniformly fatal and that recovery is more likely than dying from the disease,\" said Dr Edsel Salvana, director of the University of the Philippines' Institute of Molecular Biology. \"Please don't panic and don't share fake news.\"\n\nSalvana has been active on social media leading efforts to fight misinformation about the outbreak.\n\nThe government is also managing public concerns over the return of 30 Filipinos, including an infant, from Hubei province in China. They arrived on a chartered plane early on Sunday and were brought to an isolated facility near Manila to begin a 14-day quarantine.\n\nThe first case was the \"travelling companion\" - reported to be the girlfriend - of the 44-year old Wuhan man who died from the virus on 1 February. It is the first and only death from coronavirus outside China and Hong Kong.\n\nThe Philippines reported three cases. The third, a 60-year-old woman also from Wuhan, was belatedly confirmed after she had left the country. The health department said she appeared to have recovered from the coronavirus. She was discharged after samples sent to Australia tested negative.

The death of one doctor has shaken that claim\n\nSoon after Li Wenliang succumbed to the coronavirus in Wuhan early on Friday morning, a drawing of the Chinese doctor appeared on the internet, sleeping and being hoisted gently into heaven by an angel.\n\nFrom late in the evening until dawn yesterday, Chinese citizens stayed up, posting emotional tributes and venting their fury at the government over the treatment of the 34-year-old ophthalmologist, who had tried to warn the authorities about the virus in late December, only to be told by the police to shut up.\n\nThe authorities, seemingly in a panic at the outpouring of grief and anger, announced that Li was still being treated before reposting confirmation of his death hours later. \"You think we've all gone to sleep?\" posted one netizen? \"No. We haven't.\"\n\nIn an interview with Chinese magazine Caixin before his death, Li delivered his own verdict on the government's handling of the issue: \"I think there should be more than one voice in a healthy society.\"\n\nIt is wise to be cautious about the political impact of a single event or, in this case, one person's death, especially in China, which is ruled by an opaque Communist party. After all, can a virus that has so far claimed more than 700 lives, fewer than in a normal flu season in many countries, really hold the future of China in its thrall?\n\nHowever, the fallout from the spread of the potentially deadly coronavirus is already grim, most immediately in the form of a reeling Chinese economy that is having to temporarily sever supply lines to factories and retail outlets around the world. China has been responsible for about one-third of global growth in recent years, a greater share than the US, and any slowdown in its economy will be felt across the world.\n\nBut the greatest focus is on what Li alluded to when he complained about the country being ruled by \"one voice\", which Chinese people would immediately recognise as a barb directed at Xi Jinping. Xi has swept all enemies, real and imagined, aside since taking over as Communist party chief in late 2012 and made many more along the way.\n\nPowerful families and moneyed interests toppled by his relentless anti-corruption campaign will never forgive him and are lying in wait for revenge. Equally, many of the technocratic elite have been alienated by his illiberal economic policies and his assertiveness overseas, which they blame for triggering a concerted pushback in Washington.\n\nMuch of their anger was captured in a single moment that embodied their fears that Xi is taking the country backwards - his decision in early 2018 to do away with term limits and make himself leader in perpetuity.\n\nDifficult as it is to measure public opinion in China, it is doubtless true that for many Chinese, the anti-corruption campaign - Xi's key initiative - has been highly popular. With the economy growing steadily before the virus hit, most Chinese are also still seeing their living standards rise.\n\nBut Li's death and the mismanagement of the crisis have done more than just crystallise the elite's dislike of Xi. Over time, they could direct the anger of the wider populace against him as well.\n\n\"In previous crises, like the Wenchuan earthquake [in Sichuan in 2008], the vast majority of Chinese citizens were spectators commenting on an event that angered them but was far away,\" said Bill Bishop, of Sinocism, a Washington-based China newsletter. \"In this epidemic, no one is just a spectator - everyone is directly impacted.\"\n\nThe spread of the virus, most likely starting from live animals in the Wuhan wet market late last year, has showcased both the party state's formidable strengths and corrosive weaknesses.\n\nThe initial coverage of the virus focused on the authorities' abrupt order, issued at 2am on January 23, to quarantine Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central Hubei province.\n\n\"To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million is new to science,\" said Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization official, who seemed both in awe at the order and wryly unsure whether it would work.\n\nOnce areas surrounding Wuhan were pulled inside the sealed-off zone days later, a total of 35 million people had been effectively put into lockdown with the stroke of an administrative pen.\n\nThe power of the Chinese state and its ability to mobilise resources overnight has long been admired by foreigners, be it in building a hospital in barely a week, as in Wuhan, or enforcing a cordon sanitaire containing tens of millions of people. But it is the chronic weaknesses in the political system that exacerbated the spread of the virus in the first place.\n\nThe authoritarian strictures of the Chinese party state place a premium on the control of information in the name of maintaining stability. In such a system, lower-level officials have no incentive to report bad news up the line. Under Xi, such restrictions have grown tighter.\n\nIn Wuhan, Li and seven of his fellow doctors had been talking among themselves in an internet chat group about a new cluster of viral infections. They stopped after being warned by police. By the time the authorities reacted and quarantined the city, it was too late.\n\nLi was neither a dissident nor a pro-democracy activist seeking to overthrow the Communist party. But he was risking jail to even discuss the virus. For in Xi's China, the professional classes - doctors, lawyers, journalists and the like - all must subsume their skills and ethics to the political directives of the moment.\n\nDuring the crisis, Xi has maintained an unusually low profile, perhaps because he doesn't want to step in publicly until it is clear the health authorities have gained control of the situation and new infections start to fall.\n\nFor a man whose propaganda apparatus has recently begun to promote him as the \"people's leader\", it has been a humbling moment.\n\nRichard McGregor is a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney.

Chinese doctor, who was among the first to raise concerns about the spread of the new coronavirus in Wuhan, has died from the disease.\n\nLi Wenliang, 34, had been targeted by Chinese police for \"spreading rumours\" after posting a warning on social media in late December 2019 about a cluster of cases of a flu-like disease that had been treated at his hospital.\n\nSeven patients were in quarantine and the disease symptoms reminded him of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome). He urged colleagues to wear protective clothing at work.\n\nFour days later he was summoned to the local public security bureau, accused of \"making false comments\" and disturbing the social order. He was told that if he continued to talk about the disease, he would be \"brought to justice\".\n\nLi was one of eight people targeted by authorities for \"sharing false information\", in a heavy-handed approach that was later criticised by China's supreme court. He agreed not to discuss his concerns in public again.\n\nBut in early January he treated a woman with glaucoma without realising she was also a coronavirus patient; he appears to have been infected during the operation.\n\nOn the 10 January, when China was still insisting there had been no new cases for a week, he started coughing then developed a fever. Two days later he was in hospital; his parents also fell ill.\n\nThe Global Times, a state-owned tabloid newspaper, tweeted on Thursday that Li had died from the virus nearly a month after he fell ill.\n\nBefore he died, Li, who had a child and was expecting a second this summer, had broken his silence to give interviews from his hospital bed.\n\n\"If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency,\" he told the New York Times.\n\nLi's relative youth and the slow development of his infection may add to medical concerns about the fatality of the coronavirus.\n\nMost of the dead have been older, with underlying health conditions. It is not clear whether Li had any previous health problems.\n\nLi's fate has echoes of Carlo Urbani, an Italian doctor who played a crucial role in identifying Sars and raising the international alarm but was eventually killed by it.\n\nWorking for the World Health Organization (WHO) in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2003, he was called to a hospital when a patient arrived from Hong Kong with unusual pneumonia symptoms.\n\nHe recognised the disease was highly contagious, brought in strict controls and called in international health authorities. His action led to the WHO raising a worldwide alert about the disease and halted its spread in Vietnam.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

"Colleges must close until next month, while UK firms in the country face dramatic losses\n\nBritish universities are braced for a long shutdown of their Chinese campuses after Beijing said it would extend the closure of China's higher education sector into March to combat the spread of coronavirus.\n\nNottingham, Birmingham City and Leeds universities were among the many UK higher education providers told they must delay the return of academics and students until 2 March, after they were initially told to keep their Chinese offshoots closed until 24 February.\n\nThe decision to extend the shutdown of higher education throughout China until next month is expected to be a clear signal to other parts of the country's education system to prolong the winter break, which started in December and includes the lunar new year, until the virus is under control.\n\nBeijing has allowed local authorities to use their own judgment about when to open schools and locally controlled universities later this month, but the move to extend the closure of centrally funded and regulated universities, which includes foreign-owned campuses, is expected to persuade most local officials to follow Beijing's lead.\n\nMore than 35,000 people in China and 24 other countries have contracted the virus, and hundreds have died. The Beijing authorities have effectively quarantined a string of cities stretching from Wuhan, where the outbreak started, to the east coast and asked anyone who suspects they have flu-like symptoms to seek medical attention.\n\nMost major airlines have suspended flights to China, and governments in the region have blocked Chinese nationals from leaving the country. The US, Australia and Singapore have blocked all foreign visitors who have recently been to China. Some 30,000 Britons in mainland China have been advised to leave, although it is unclear whether they will be allowed to travel with their spouses. The last government-chartered repatriation flight out of Wuhan is due to depart on Sunday.\n\nCity streets and shopping malls in China have largely been deserted for the last two weeks, leading western retailers to shut their stores. Apple, which relies on China for about a fifth of its store sales, has closed its shops and offices until further notice. Starbucks closed almost half of its 4,300 outlets in China, leading to a dramatic fall in the price of coffee on international markets.\n\nThe upmarket fashion retailer Burberry said wealthy Chinese consumers were staying away from its Chinese shops and travel restrictions had curbed overseas shopping sprees, leading to a dramatic loss of business.\n\nCuts in factory production across the country's industrial heartland have also pushed down the price of oil from almost $70 for a barrel of Brent crude a month ago to $54 last week.\n\nIn the last week, the car firm Fiat Chrysler has warned that it will need to shut one of its European factories unless the virus is brought under control and shipments of vital parts and electronic components are restarted from Chinese ports.\n\nNottingham University runs a campus for almost 8,000 students in the city of Ningbo, 25 miles south of Shanghai. A spokeswoman said: \"Our overriding priority is for the health of our students, staff and community. However, our aim will be to ensure that none of our students are academically or economically disadvantaged. Along with other universities in China, [the campus] is observing all advice from the health authorities and has extended the lunar new year holiday. The new semester is now planned to start on 2 March.\"\n\nShe said the university would be able to cope with a degree of disruption over the coming months. \"The university has longstanding contingency arrangements to amend semester dates and provide additional learning resources and support through online methods.\"\n\nBirmingham City University has 1,000 Chinese students at its joint venture with Wuhan Textile University - the Birmingham Institute of Fashion and Creative Art. A spokesman said: \"Wuhan Textile University was closed for the lunar new year, and its reopening will be a matter for our Chinese partners. We are in close communication with our partners and the UK government to understand the impact on our students.\"\n\nLiverpool University has a joint venture with Xi'an Jiaotong University, which has 32,000 students and is based north-east of Wuhan.\n\nThe university sector alone contributes about \u00a322bn or 1.2% to the UK's annual \u00a32 trillion GDP and is considered one of the UK's most successful export industries. Newcastle, Reading, Southampton and Heriot-Watt universities also have outposts in Malaysia, which announced its first person-to-person transmission of the virus on Friday.", "source": {"uri":

evacuation flight delayed", "body": "Australians who had been due to leave Wuhan on Friday night remain stranded in the city where the coronavirus outbreak began after the flight was delayed until at least Saturday.\n\nThe second Qantas coronavirus evacuation flight had been scheduled to fly overnight on Friday from locked down Wuhan to a quarantine site outside of Darwin.\n\nBut as they waited to board on Friday passengers were informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that the flight had been delayed because Australia had \"not received official clearance\" from Chinese authorities to land in the city.\n\n\"You should return to your homes or places of accommodation and we will send you more information when it is available,\" am email sent to passengers from Dfat read.\n\n\"We are working with Chinese authorities in order to reschedule the flight for tomorrow.\n\n\"As you had a previously confirmed seat/s on the aircraft this evening, your seat is confirmed for the next flight departing Wuhan which we anticipate will depart on Saturday February 8.\n\n\"We know that this unexpected delay will cause stress and inconvenience, which we regret.\"\n\nIn a statement Dfat confirmed the flight had been \"prepositioned\" in Hong Kong and was \"awaiting approval from the Chinese authorities to fly to Wuhan\".\n\n\"Many flights out of Wuhan have been delayed. We are engaging closely with the Chinese authorities to ensure our flight can proceed as soon as possible,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We are in contact with all passengers on the manifest about the status of the flight.\n\n\"The assisted departure is a complex operation under difficult circumstances. Any such departure is always subject to operational requirements and to Chinese government final approval.\"\n\nScott Morrison confirmed on Friday that a vacated former construction workers' village outside Darwin would be used as the quarantine site for the evacuees. More than 300 Australians remain trapped in Wuhan - which has been quarantined by Chinese authorities - and the flight was expected to be the last out of the city that the Australian government would be able to charter.\n\nGlobally, the outbreak has infected more than 31,000 people and killed 636, the vast majority of those in Hubei province.\n\nThe first Qantas flight evacuated 243 Australian citizens and permanent residents to Christmas Island on Monday. Thirty-six Australians who left Wuhan on a NZ-government chartered flight on Wednesday were also eventually taken to Christmas Island.\n\nThe chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, declared the Christmas Island quarantine site full after the arrival of that flight. The centre can house more than 1,000 people, but the capacity of the centre is significantly reduced because of the medical necessity to isolate coronavirus evacuees from each other to minimise the impact of any possible outbreak.\n\nThe Manigurr-ma village, 30km outside Darwin\u00ad, was built in 2012 by Japanese energy giant Inpex as accommodation for its workers. At the peak of construction work on Inpex's $55bn gas plant on Darwin Harbour it housed around 3,500 workers.\n\nThe facility has swimming, cycling and indoor cricket facilities, as well as a medical centre, industrial kitchen, dining hall, cinema, library and gym.\n\nMurphy said those staying at the Howard Springs facility were unlikely to become infectious and their health would be closely monitored.\n\n\"It is important people living in and around Howard Springs know the novel coronavirus can only be transmitted by close contact with an infectious person and cannot be spread through the air,\" he said.\n\n\"The health and safety of the Howard Springs community is of paramount importance and I am confident the security and public health measures put in place will prevent any risk to the community's health.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_mcgowan@theguardian.com", "name": "Michael McGowan",

flight carrying more than 200 Australian evacuees from Wuhan has landed in Darwin, after being granted delayed clearance to fly from Chinese authorities who locked down the city in response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe travellers will disembark through the RAAF base rather than the main airport terminal and will be taken by bus to the disused Manigurr-Ma work camp 30km from Darwin to be monitored for the virus.\n\nThe Qantas flight was scheduled to leave the city in China's central Hubei on Friday but take-off was delayed until late on Saturday.\n\nEvacuees were initially expected to be quarantined for 14 days on Christmas Island, before a decision was made on Friday to take them to Darwin.\n\nForeign minister Marise Payne confirmed the flight had left Wuhan on Sunday morning.\n\n\"My thanks to Qantas and all Australian officials involved,\" Payne said on twitter. \"We appreciate the cooperative approach of the Chinese Government.\"\n\nIt comes as the number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus outbreak reached 813, overtaking the global death toll from the 2002-2003 Sars epidemic.\n\nA further 81 people have died since Friday, the Hubei province health commission said. About 780 of those who have died were from Hubei province and only two -- a Chinese man who died in the Philippines and a 39-year-old in Hong Kong -- have died outside mainland China.\n\nMore than 37,100 people are confirmed to have been infected worldwide, including 15 in Australia.\n\nPrime minister Scott Morrison confirmed on Friday that the mining camp had been set up as a second quarantine site, and said the government was working with local communities on the \"implications of those arrangements\".\n\nThe flight was reportedly over-subscribed. It's unlikely Australia will be able to organise a third charter flight with China tightening travel restrictions.\n\nIt was the second evacuation flight, after a Qantas flight on Monday ferried 243 Australian citizens and permanent residents to Christmas Island. A further 36 Australians were taken to Christmas Island after catching an evacuation flight from Wuhan to New Zealand.\n\nEducation minister Dan Tehan said Richmond air base in NSW was initially considered as a quarantine point for Australians evacuated from China.\n\nBut he says it was turned down because it it is a working air base and Christmas Island was chosen instead.\n\nNine newspapers say the NSW government offered screening by medical personnel at the RAAF Richmond base and quarantine facilities in hospitals under a NSW health plan.\n\n\"We had to take a number of considerations into account, but the fact that it is a working air base was one of those factors,\" Tehan told Sky News on Sunday. \"The government ... I think made the right choice in going to Christmas Island. Now we are looking at other facilities.\"\n\nTehan said the financial impact of the virus on Australia's university sector, which is heavily reliant on international students from China, could be \"significant\".\n\n\"The next two to three weeks I think is going to be absolutely crucial as to where we go and what the ultimate impact will be,\" he said. If Chinese students missed the whole of the first semester, Tehan said there could be a \"significant impact\".\n\nCredit rating agency Standard & Poor's estimates Australia's university sector risks suffering $3.1bn in lost fees in the first semester.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "calla_wahlquist@theguardian.com", "name":

"British farmers are not often called hysterical. For Boris Johnson to dismiss their concerns over food imports post-Brexit seems to show he is willing to see an influx of cheap, low-quality food that British farmers will not be able to compete with. That would hasten the decline of family-run farms, and open up the countryside further to the sort of \"megafarms\" common in the US.\n\nCheap food sounds good, but Johnson has glossed over the dangers. Chlorine-washing chicken is partly an issue of animal welfare - poultry in the US are kept in filthy conditions that would be illegal here, then the carcasses are dipped in bleach. But it is one of food safety too, contrary to Johnson's claims.\n\nIf the UK's food standards are to be science-based, as he claims, they will have to account for science that shows the washing of chicken in chlorine only masks the presence of pathogens, rather than eliminating them. That leaves the harmful germs able to carry on infecting humans after the bleach treatment.\n\nJohnson's scientists will also have to explain why serious food poisoning is a greater problem in the US than the UK. For instance, the US reports about 420 deaths each year from salmonella, while Public Health England found none in its most recent labs data. \"We would like some clarity from the prime minister about how exactly he intends to keep the UK population safe from food imported from countries with lower standards than our own,\" said Kath Dalmeny, the chief executive of Sustain, the food and farming alliance.\n\nThen there are the indirect impacts on human health, arguably much more alarming than food poisoning. Though the coronavirus may have come from wild animals, others such as swine flu and bird flu were associated with intensive livestock rearing.\n\nIntensive farming also requires huge inputs of antibiotics, which are leading to the rapid evolution of antibiotic-resistant superbugs of the kind that may soon make even routine operations life-threatening.\n\nLet the prime minister examine the science of intensive farming and food production: he will find little mumbo-jumbo and a lot to be worried about.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

newborn", "body": "News that a 30-hour-old newborn baby had become the youngest person to have been diagnosed with coronavirus has prompted speculation that the potentially lethal illness could potentially be passed from a mother to a fetus.\n\nBut medical experts have warned against drawing conclusions so early in investigation of the virus, which has infected 24,500 people mostly in China.\n\n\"We're still in the deep learning curve about this virus,\" said Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Hotez developed a vaccine for Sars, another coronavirus which spread in China in 2003. \"There's more we don't know than we do know\" about the new coronavirus, he said.\n\nSome viruses can be passed from mother to child through breastmilk or through the placenta during pregnancy. Such cases of maternal transmission are called \"vertical transmission\" by researchers.\n\nSuch transmission does happens in rubella - also known as German measles or three-day measles - and in some cases in HIV. But such behavior in viruses is uncommon, said Hotez, especially among respiratory illnesses such as the coronavirus.\n\nViruses that can be transmitted through the placenta, or intrauterine, are even more uncommon.\n\n\"We know it happens for instance in HIV-Aids, but even there in the pre-retroviral drug era when I was taking care of infants with Aids, even in untreated mothers it was still only about 25% [of cases],\" said Hotez.\n\nA doctor in Wuhan, the city in Hubei province, China at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, set off speculation after he mentioned doctors needed to be on the lookout for vertical transmission in a report on Chinese state media.\n\nZeng Lingkong, chief physician of Wuhan children hospital's neonatal medicine department, said, \"This reminds us to pay attention to mother-to-child being a possible route of coronavirus transmission,\" according to AFP.\n\nPaul Hunter, professor in medicine, at the University of East Anglia in the UK, said that when women give birth vaginally, babies are exposed to microbes present in the the mother's body.\n\n\"As far as I am aware there is currently no evidence that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted in the womb,\" he said. \"If a baby does get infected with coronavirus a few days after birth we currently cannot tell if the baby was infected in the womb or during birth.\"\n\nHunter said that one study showed that coronaviruses (which include Mers and Sars) are more likely to increase risk of a miscarriage than be passed on in the womb.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

"Late-night hosts unpack the State of the Union address and Trump's (false) promise to protect pre-existing conditions\n\nTrevor Noah\n\n\"Why does the president get to give his own job evaluation?\" Trevor Noah wondered on the Daily Show of Donald Trump's State of the Union address, delivered on Tuesday night. \"It's strange - it's like you're in the middle of firing someone who's belligerent at work but then you get interrupted by their birthday party.\"\n\nTrump mostly stuck to the script, said Noah, which included plenty of falsities. \"No Trump speech would be complete without an absolute, blatant lie,\" he said. \"And for tonight's address, Trump went with an old classic: that he's the champion of healthcare.\"\n\nAt one point, Trump promised an \"ironclad pledge\" to \"always protect patients with pre-existing conditions\".\n\n\"Really?\" said Noah. \"That lie is so extreme that if he was Pinocchio he would've impaled Mitch McConnell in his seat.\n\n\"Here's the truth: Trump tried to kill protections for pre-existing conditions when he went after Obamacare, and right now - right now! - his administration is in court trying to kill it again,\" Noah continued. \"So him claiming to be the champion of protecting pre-existing conditions is like the coronavirus being like: 'I love Chinese people, I really do.'\"\n\nFinally, Noah addressed one of the night's most viral moments: Nancy Pelosi ripping her copy of Trump's speech in half after he concluded. \"I feel like every year she finds a new way to show Trump just how little she thinks of him and his speech,\" said Noah. Last year was the sideways clap, this year, the speech rip. \"Trump better pray he doesn't get another State of the Union,\" Noah said, \"because at this rate, next time she's just going to show up and throw vegetables at him during the speech.\"\n\nStephen Colbert\n\nStephen Colbert responded live to Trump's State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, in an updated version of his Don and the Giant Imspeech segment. The theme of Trump's address was the Great American Comeback, which is a \"nice title\", said Colbert, \"but I want to point out: tonight he never actually said the great American comeback: I know you are, but what am I?\"\n\nColbert surveyed the night's attendees, including Melania Trump, Mike Pence and Chief Justice John Roberts, who is currently presiding over Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate - \"yet another American forced to work two jobs in Trump's economy\", Colbert said.\n\nTrump declared that \"the years of economic decay are over\". \"But the years of mental decay have just begun,\" Colbert continued, imitating the president. \"Where is Kansas City? Where is Missouri? I'll never know.\"\n\n\"A record number of young Americans are now employed,\" said Trump, boasting of the economy. \"Mostly campaigning for Bernie,\" Colbert added.\n\nIn sum, Trump \"made up a lot of stuff, like saying that he was trying to protect pre-existing conditions\", said Colbert. \"I think he assumes that our pre-existing condition is amnesia that he tried to destroy protections for pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nAt the end of his speech, Trump tried to strike an uplifting tone, recalling America's ancestors who \"vanquished tyranny and fascism\". \"And in just three years,\" Colbert imitated, \"I've brought those last two back.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nIn Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel reacted to the many self-aggrandizing exaggerations and lies in Trump's State of the Union, though \"in fairness to the president, why should we expect him to deliver the State of the Union when he doesn't even know the state of Kansas City?\" he said, referencing Trump's Super Bowl blunder.\n\nTrump's theme was the Great American Comeback, focusing on the economy and stock market, \"which is a little like the captain of the Titanic going: 'Yeah, have you tried the shrimp?'\" Kimmel said.\n\nKimmel also picked apart Trump's promise to protect those with pre-existing conditions, \"which is something I will definitely remind him of when he most certainly does exactly the opposite of that. It really is brazen, how he just says things and then does the opposite of them.\"\n\nKimmel took particular issue with Trump awarding the nation's highest civilian honor, the presidential medal of freedom, to conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. \"Today is Rosa Parks Day, and this is a medal they gave Rosa Parks - tonight, Rush Limbaugh got it,\" said Kimmel. \"And then, Trump turned his plan to cripple public schools into what was basically a gameshow,\" as he surprise-awarded one African American student the opportunity to go \"to the school of your choice\".\n\nThe gameshow theatrics - Trump also surprise-reunited a soldier and his wife - \"was like an Oprah's favorite things show, but without Oprah\", said Kimmel.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

growing concern that the new coronavirus may be going undetected in Indonesia, where officials have not confirmed a single case of infection in the country of 272 million people which has close links to China.\n\nAs of Thursday, Indonesia said it had no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and that 238 people evacuated from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, had not shown symptoms or been tested.\n\nMore than 630 people have been killed by the virus in China, while confirmed infections have passed 30,000 globally. Most cases are concentrated in China, though the virus has been recorded in countries across Asia, as well as Europe, Australia and the US.\n\nA study by academics from Harvard university analysed the number of passengers taking flights from Wuhan to destinations around the world, and found that the number of cases identified in both Indonesia and Cambodia appeared below what might be expected. The study, published quickly to improve scientists' understanding of the outbreak, has not been peer reviewed, but adds to mounting fears that cases are not being identified.\n\nIt also suggested that cases recorded in Thailand, where 25 cases have been identified so far, were also below the number scientists might expect to see. Cambodia has so far confirmed one case of coronavirus.\n\nProfessor Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, said that if cases were not being spotted, then there was a risk of further infection and new outbreaks emerging. \"You'd be thinking close contacts - family, close friends maybe business meetings - could be then infected by these cases and this could set up a little hotspot of infection.\"\n\nScientists do not believe the disease is airborne, he said. \"So it's not really simple to pick up - you do have to have some face-to-face time with someone in order to pass that virus on.\"\n\nHopefully, Mackay added, people will report to a doctor if they are sick, and they will then be quarantined accordingly once their travel history is observed.\n\nReports have questioned the ability of Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, to test for the virus, though the Indonesian health ministry said on Wednesday that it has all the necessary resources.\n\nIndonesia, which receives significant Chinese investment, relies heavily on Chinese tourism. The country's Chinese-Indonesians are estimated to make up around 3% of the population.\n\nThere is also concern over the thousands of Chinese tourists, including 200 people from Wuhan, who are reportedly stranded in Bali after direct flights to mainland China were banned by Indonesia. None of the tourists were showing symptoms, according to officials, but they are not in quarantine.\n\nCitizens evacuated evacuated from Wuhan, however, remain under observation at a military base on the remote Natuna island, where residents have protested against their presence.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Queensland treasurer says", "body": "Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg has told his state counterparts to wait until April to discuss the economic impact from coronavirus, despite confirming it will be bigger than the Sars pandemic.\n\nImpacted states are pushing to have the discussion much earlier, with Queensland, considered to have one of the most exposed economies, particularly critical of the Morrison government's handling of the expanding health crisis.\n\nQueensland deputy premier and treasurer Jackie Trad told the Guardian the \"let's chat about it in a couple of months\" response from the federal government, in the wake of warnings from the RBA and industry stakeholders of potential impact was \"simply not good enough\".\n\n\"This on the day the Reserve Bank has revised down national economic growth because of bushfires, drought and coronavirus,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm calling on the federal treasurer to convene an urgent meeting of treasurers from every jurisdiction to discuss and plan a response to the impact of the coronavirus on the Australian economy.\"\n\nIn his letter to the states, Frydenberg outlined why the coronavirus spread was a threat to the economy, but proposed waiting until the next scheduled council of federal financial relations meeting in two months to discuss it.\n\nFrydenberg also said the treasury would be able to give a briefing on the \"scenario analysis conducted to date\", while reiterating why the coronavirus was expected to have a bigger impact than the Sars pandemic of 2003.\n\n\"China's share of Australia's tourism export value has increased by nearly seven-fold since 2002-2003. In 2018-2019, China accounted for 19% of total Australian tourism export value, worth $4.3bn.\"\n\n\"After the Sars virus was contained, China, the region and Australia all saw significant bounce backs. Once we succeed in containing coronavirus, we would expect a similar recovery. The key question is how long this may take.\"\n\nQueensland has previously called for industries expected to be impacted by the coronavirus, such as tourism and trade, to be compensated under the federal government's disaster relief payments, but has so far been rebuffed.\n\nChanges to the funding would require negotiations between the commonwealth and the states and territories, and state governments want the treasurers' meeting brought forward to respond to the economic impact of coronavirus and the bushfires.\n\nIn the wake of China cancelling international group tours late last month, and then Australia banning travel for non-Australian citizens and residents from China, Australia's economy is likely to take a hit from coronavirus, from tourism to education and resources.\n\nRatings agency S&P slashed its forecast of China's economic growth for this year by 0.75 percentage points, saying the coronavirus will deliver a big temporary hit to the country's economy that will spill over to the whole world.\n\n\"The global impact will be felt through four real economy channels: sharply reduced tourism revenues, lower exports of consumer and capital goods, lower commodity prices, and industrial supply-chain disruptions,\" it said.\n\nReserve bank chair Philip Lowe has already warned that the coronavirus could do more damage to the Australian economy than the 2003 Sars outbreak.\n\nQueensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told the state parliament on Thursday the Cairns region alone had already lost $200m in bookings, and Gold Coast operators are expecting to lose $400m.\n\n\"Farmers, fishers, tourism operators and universities all told of lost business impacting now,\" Palaszczuk said.\n\n\"There are trawlers unable to fish because the market for coral trout and premium mud crab has evaporated overnight.\"\n\nTrad said the state was attempting to get ahead of a potential economic disaster, brought on as a secondary impact of the virus's spread.\n\n\"What we are trying to avoid is a situation where literally hundreds of workers are being displaced on a daily basis because we aren't getting the tourists or the students or for example, the cancellation in agricultural or safety products to Chinese markets,\" she said.\n\n\"These are all things that are happening right now. And we don't know how long it will go and how far it will go.\n\nAnd what the Australian government needs to do, is be a bit more responsive and empathetic, rather than being dismissive.\"\n\nGuardian

"Here's one anniversary I won't be celebrating: 10 years ago this week, the Lancet retracted an article published in 1998 that linked the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. The retraction followed a General Medical Council (GMC) ruling that lead author Andrew Wakefield had been dishonest.\n\nAfter the original paper, and despite the immediate objections raised by the medical community, there was a significant drop in MMR rates in the UK. In my GP surgery, rational people expressed concerns along the lines of \"There's no smoke without fire\", \"I'll wait until my child is older so that I can be sure they're not autistic\", \"My friend's child was diagnosed with autism a few months after his MMR\" and \"I'll get the jabs done privately so they can be given separately\".\n\nThe success of vaccination programmes means that we get complacent and forget that these childhood infections can kill. Parents of babies born today in the UK are unlikely to ever come across measles or meningitis, and there hasn't been a naturally occurring case of polio in the UK since 1984. A mother told me recently that she was against vaccination and didn't believe the illnesses were a threat nowadays. She's right - because most of the other children in her baby's cohort will be vaccinated, hers is likely to be safe because of herd immunity. I sent her some links and asked her to reconsider. As GPs we're not supposed to get cross so I didn't say what I really thought.\n\nOn the whole, MMR rates have improved over the past 10 years although they remain just below the WHO recommended coverage of 95% or more. At its lowest ebb, in 2003-04, only 80% of under-twos in the UK were given MMR. Reasons for the improvement in uptake probably include the passage of time, detailed rebuttals of Wakefield's work, the discovery of his possible conflicts of interest and the absence of further studies to validate his claims. The public appears to have recognised that sometimes there is smoke without fire.\n\nFear has also played a part in improving uptake. There have been measles outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities in the US and Europe. Local rabbis have responded by urging their followers to vaccinate their kids and there is some evidence that this has been effective.\n\nBut on a global scale, attitudes and wariness of officialdom can be harder to shift. The WHO is concerned that there were more cases of measles in 2019 than in any year since 2006 and that multiple countries have declared outbreaks. Inevitably, children in the lowest-income countries are most at risk. A measles outbreak late last year killed more than 6,000 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone. But measles isn't Sars or a new coronavirus, so the deaths attracted relatively little international attention.\n\nWe live in paradoxical times. We buy more unproven, expensive \"healthcare\" products and treatments than ever before. Wellness products, such as those seen in Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Lab on Netflix, enjoy enormous success, even as they are criticised by figures like the head of the NHS. Many seem willing, even happy, to suspend disbelief to buy into fake science. But among the enthusiasm for unproven therapies rests a profound scepticism to orthodox, evidence-based healthcare.\n\nCommitted anti-vaxxers sometimes display a sort of religious zealotry that makes attempts at dialogue deeply frustrating. But there is no reason to dismiss the concerns of parents and caregivers who worry about autism, the effects of vaccines and the interventions of the medical profession. Putting pressure on people, shaming them or forcing them to do something that they are scared of is never a good idea. Most people are reasonable: give them the data and they are only too pleased that their child has access to life-saving vaccinations.\n\n* Ann Robinson is a GP", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

Raab has urged all British nationals in China to leave the country if they can following the outbreak of the coronavirus, which has spread to two dozen countries.\n\nThe foreign secretary said in statement: \"The safety and security of British people will always be our top priority. As such, we now advise British nationals in China to leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus.\n\n\"Where there are still British nationals in Hubei province who wish to be evacuated, we will continue to work around the clock to facilitate this.\"\n\nThe Foreign Office in its latest travel advice warned that elderly people and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be at heightened risk.\n\nThere are an estimated 30,000 British nationals in China, according to the health secretary, Matt Hancock.\n\nBritish citizens have been gradually evacuated from Wuhan, the Chinese city in Hubei province at the centre of the outbreak. The UK government has been allocated 14 places on an Air New Zealand flight on Tuesday for British nationals and their dependants. Those already evacuated from Wuhan have been taken to a quarantine facility at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral.\n\nTwo people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK. The patients, who are members of the same family and believed to be Chinese nationals, are receiving specialist care at the Airborne High Consequence Infectious Diseases Centre in Newcastle's Royal Victoria infirmary.\n\nHancock, said he expected further cases as the global community worked to stop the rapid spread of the virus. Speaking before a meeting with the German health minister, Jens Spahn, on Tuesday, Hancock said the UK was working with other countries to research a vaccine.\n\n\"We haven't seen the peak of the coronavirus by a long stretch and we expect more cases in the UK,\" Hancock said. \"We have a full plan in place to treat all those who have symptoms and test positively for coronavirus and we are working with international partners both to slow the spread and also to do the research that we need to do to find a vaccine.\"\n\nSpahn added it was important the UK and EU continue to co-operate regardless of their future relationship. He said: \"The virus obviously knows no borders and is a threat to all our citizens. What's important for the international community is to join forces when it comes to research, when it comes to detecting the virus and combating it.\"\n\nChina's national mortality rate of coronavirus is running at 2.1%, while in Hubei province, which accounts for 97% of all fatalities, the rate is 3%. China's national health commission said 80% of deaths were of people over the age of 60 and 75% had underlying conditions.\n\nTens of thousands of British nationals in China work across professions from business and consultancy to academia and medicine.\n\nThey include executives at international companies and entrepreneurs who have set up their own companies in the country, teachers at prestigious international schools and English-language teachers at Chinese schools.\n\nThere are also academics, journalists, doctors working at international hospitals, many language students and some university students studying at Chinese institutions.\n\nIf they want to leave, many will have to break contracts, leave behind businesses abandon studies, and take children out of school.\n\nIt will also have inevitable knock-on effects for Chinese citizens who work for or with British nationals, take classes from them, or rely on them for medical care or other services.\n\nIt is not clear how Chinese authorities or individual institutions will react to the UK government's call for its nationals to leave. Their angry response to the US government's ban on most travellers from China suggests they are unlikely to be sympathetic.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

on Instagram", "body": "In a forest in Siberia, more than 140 Russians and others evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, have been confined to a sanatorium patrolled by members of Russia's National Guard instructed to let no one enter or exit.\n\nInside, many have taken to Instagram to blog their time in quarantine, snapping photos of their dinner and exercise routines, or even holding live Q&A sessions from the rooms they will be confined to for the next two weeks.\n\nWhat would in the past have been a solitary affair, a fortnight fighting fear and boredom in quarantine during an international health emergency, has been transformed through wifi and social media into Russia's strangest reality show.\n\n\"I'm making a style from pyjamas for prisoners (in the quarantine zone),\" wrote one young woman, posing on her bed in the green-and-white striped robes issued to the evacuees.\n\nPavel Lichman, a model who was evacuated from Wuhan, published a video of himself working out, a circuit of planks, sit-ups and leg lifts. \"My health is in order, thanks to my workout,\" he joked in a caption.\n\n\"We're in a guest house about 30 kilometres from Tyumen,\" a city in western Siberia, Lichman told The Guardian. \"The quarantine is pretty hands-off and easy. The only thing is that we're not allowed to come into contact with the people who are in the neighbouring rooms. We don't leave our rooms. They bring us food. Doctors come in to test us: check our temperatures, inspect our throats, and measure the amount of oxygen in our blood.\"\n\n\"We're going to do sport,\" he said of his plans for the next two weeks. \"I'm going to have a blog on TikTok, read books, watch TV shows, answer questions for journalists. We've got dominos. We're going to talk, develop ourselves, and look after our health.\"\n\nIf the evacuees leave their rooms, doctors warned, the two-week countdown starts again.\n\nIn blog posts, some thanked the Russian government for their evacuation, while others asked why they'd been transported to the middle of Siberia, roomed in groups of two or three, and relieved of all their personal belongings.\n\nThe online posts have also provided a counterpoint to official Russian information about the quarantine. Although government officials said on Thursday that no one at the Tyumen facility had showed signs of illness, one woman wrote that an evacuee had taken by doctors during the night after showing a slight temperature.\n\nIn the other rooms, Russians took stock of the bizarre turn of events that had left them without their luggage, confined to their rooms at a sanatorium usually reserved for convalescents. There, they fielded a slew of requests from journalists and well-wishers, as well as some criticism from locals angry that the quarantine had been established in their region.\n\n\"I can imagine the displeasure of people from Tyumen due to our arrival,\" wrote Nadezhda, another evacuee from Wuhan. \"But I remind you: we were taken directly from the plane to the sanatorium, everyone was in masks, there was no contact with other people. Now we are going to sit in quarantine for two weeks without leaving our rooms.\"\n\n\"I don't understand where all the hate and panic comes from,\" she continued. \"I feel like the holy inquisition is waiting for us at night. \ud83d\ude01\"\n\nMost planned out their time in lockdown. \"Plans for the next two weeks,\" one young woman wrote, while firing up a Netflix documentary about the rapper Travis Scott. Another said she planned to use the time to study languages.\n\nMarina Zaitseva, a student who was visiting Wuhan when the outbreak occurred, gave a video tour of a guest room provided with a travel chessboard, two books (My Name is Ophelia and That Perfect Someone), tea, bananas and a jar of pickles.\n\nIn earlier remarks to the Fontanka.ru website, she described a difficult evacuation from China aboard a military airplane with little idea of where they were headed when they reached Russia. When they arrived at the sanatorium, they were told to give up their clothing for disinfection.\n\n\"In the hall we were met by people not just in masks, but in full bodysuits,\" she said. \"They met us as though we were radiating this virus.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_roth@theguardian.com", "name": "Andrew

death toll passes 490 as UK urges citizens to leave - latest news", "body": "The latest figures show that 490 people have died in mainland China from the virus. According to the very reliable Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are now 23,680 confirmed cases in the mainland meaning the mortality rate from the virus is 2.07% nationally.\n\nOf the deaths, 479 have now occurred in Hubei province where the capital, Wuhan, is the eipicentre of the deadly outbreak. There have been 16,678 confirmed cases in the province making for a death rate of 2.87% in the province.\n\nThe next highest number of deaths is two in the provinces of Henan, Chongqing and Heliongjiang, showing how concentrated the outbreak has been.\n\nWelcome to our rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. I'm Martin Farrer and I'll start by outlining the main developments today:\n\nThe death toll in the Chinese province of Hubei has risen to 479 as of the end of Tuesday local time. There have been 3,156 new cases reported in the epicentre making 16,678 in the province. The mainland China total is now 490 deaths, with 23,680 recorded cases. There has also been one death in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines, bringing the global total to 492. Almost a dozen people on a cruise liner at the Japanese port of Yokohama have tested positive for coronavirus, Reuters is reporting. All British nationals have been advised to leave China in a move criticised as leaving people to fend for themselves. An eight-year-old boy has become Australia's 13th confirmed case. He is isolation in a hospital in Queensland. An Air New Zealand evacuation has left Wuhan carrying 193 passengers, including 100 New Zealanders, 23 Australians and 70 people from Pacific countries such as Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Kiribati, Tonga, Fiji and the Federated States of Micronesia. Hyundai is suspending production in South Korea because the outbreak has disrupted the supply of parts from China. Nike became the latest multinational company to warns that it expects its business to be damaged by the outbreak. Global financial markets rallied for the second day in a row on Tuesday as invesorts shrugged off concerns that the virus could damage the world economy.\n\nBeforeI bring you more details on all these developments, here is a roundup some of the precautions being taken by countries around the world:", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

of UK evacuees from the city at the centre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak has not been formally told that one of the other passengers on their flight has since been tested positive for the virus, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nBelgium's health agency announced on Tuesday that a Belgian woman was found to be carrying the virus after travelling back from Wuhan on a French repatriation flight on Sunday.\n\nConfirmation of the case has caused concerned among a group of 11 British residents who were on the flight with her and are now in quarantine in Arrowe Park in Wirral. They said they had not been given any information about it from the UK authorities.\n\nJeff Siddle, his wife, Sindy, and their nine-year-old daughter, Jasmine, read about the Belgian case in media reports.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, he said: \"It's given us concern again. We're now back to worrying.\"\n\nHe is anxious that the woman, who displayed no flu symptoms, may have passed on the virus to other passengers. Siddle, a 54-year-old software developer, said: \"Especially on an airplane, you always get colds and stuff because everyone's packed so tightly together. So we've got stress on that again.\"\n\nAdam Bridgeman, who was evacuated with his Chinese wife and one-month-old baby son, said he did not know about the Belgian case. He said: \"I understand the authorities might not have wanted to further stress us out. I don't mind having not been formally notified.\"\n\nThe group of 11 UK nationals and their families were among more than 250 people who were flown back from Wuhan. The French chartered flight, which included evacuees from 30 different countires, landed at a military airbase in Istres, southern France. The non-French evacuees were then flown to their respective countries.\n\nTwenty evacuees presented some coronavirus symptoms and stayed at the military airbase to allow tests to be carried out.\n\nNone of the 83 British people and 27 foreign nationals onboard the first UK-chartered evacuation flight, which left last Friday, have since been tested positive.\n\nSiddle believes that confirmation of the positive test for one of the passengers on the second flight may make treatment more complicated for the 11 UK evacuees who were onboard.\n\nHe said: \"The staff here know this is going to add an extra dimension on us compared to the first flight in terms of medical tests and screening and things, but we don't know exact details on that yet, it's still to be decided.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was aware that a Belgian woman on the flight had since tested positive. He said: \"Public Health England were notified that the Belgian national had tested positive. As far as we are concerned, all those who were on the flight are in supervised isolation and are being monitored for any symptoms. It has not been made clear to us that there are any other cases.\"\n\nPublic Health England has yet to comment on why the UK evacuees were not formally informed about the Belgian case.", "source":

need a more effective measure than GDP", "body": "In the face of the bushfire and the coronavirus, the Reserve Bank has taken a fairly upbeat view of the economy. When announcing that the cash rate would remain at 0.75%, the RBA suggested that the bushfires and the coronavirus would \"temporarily weigh on domestic growth\" but that overall things were doing OK. With luck this will be the case, but given the speed of events we should make sure we do not wait for GDP growth to determine whether or not we are likely to have a recession.\n\nTo be fair to the RBA, the central bank can hardly come out and say things are stuffed and a recession is on the way - that would be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nBut the RBA was perhaps somewhat more optimistic than it needed to be arguing that the current low level of interest rates, the tax refunds of last year and infrastructure spending were helping keep the economy afloat. It also noted \"a brighter outlook for the resources sector and, later this year, an expected recovery in residential construction\", something I noted on Tuesday with regards to the latest building approvals figures.\n\nIn November the bank estimated annual GDP growth in June this year of 2.8% - up from the latest growth of 1.7%. Speaking before the national press club on Wednesday, the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, suggested: \"The bushfires will reduce GDP growth by around 0.2 percentage points across the two quarters.\"\n\nBut, he argued, because of the rebuilding efforts, and insurance payments, \"GDP growth for 2020 as a whole will be largely unaffected\".\n\nThe market reacted to the RBA's outlook by pricing in a rate cut to occur by May and a better than two-thirds chance of a further cut to 0.25% by the end of this year.\n\nOn Tuesday I took a somewhat similar view to the RBA. I was not exactly positive (I am more of an economic glass-half-empty kind of guy), but I believe we should just be a bit cautious before declaring a recession is on the way.\n\nBut this talk of a recession also brought with it a bit of a debate over just how we should calculate it.\n\nAs I noted on Tuesday, the standard (and misnamed) \"technical\" recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.\n\nThat measure is not only rather simplistic, it is also a pretty high bar to reach. Such a measure for example allows us to boast that we have not had a recession since the early 1990s despite pretty good evidence that we did have a small recession during the GFC.\n\nWe could perhaps use per capita GDP growth, as that would remove the impact of population growth. But such a measure would have had us in a recession in 2006, when we were decidedly not, and even during the GFC we did not have two consecutive periods of negative GDP per capita growth, and yet we did last year.\n\nWe could measure the growth of the private sector. This would remove government spending that might artificially keep GDP growing.\n\nAgain, such a measure is useful, but does not produce two quarters of consecutive negative growth during the GFC (although there were three out of five such quarters), while last year there were two such consecutive quarters.\n\nThat is a good way of showing that last year the economy was performing poorly; however, any measure that suggests last year was a recession, but the GFC was not, is a failure.\n\nWe could also look at the private domestic economy - in effect GDP minus government spending and exports - to give us private sector \"gross national expenditure\".\n\nThis measure suggests we had a recession in 2001, 2009, 2014 and have also been in one since the end of 2018.\n\nThat again highlights just how poorly the economy is currently performing, but perhaps suffers from the bar of a \"recession\" being set too low. It also means we are discounting exports which is not particularly useful when wishing to examine the entire economy.\n\nAll these measures also suffer from a time lag. We will only find out the GDP growth of the March quarter on 3 June, and for the following quarter on 2 September.\n\nThus we might be in a recession now, but will only have it confirmed in seven months time.\n\nThe Grattan Institute's Matt Cowgill and a number of other commenters on Twitter suggested using a measure devised by an economist from the US Federal Reserve, Claudia Sahm.\n\nHer measure focuses purely on unemployment. This has the benefit of looking at the measure we most care about (do we give a damn if GDP shrinks, but unemployment doesn't rise?), and because unemployment figures come out each month, it is faster than GDP.\n\nShe suggests comparing a rolling three month average of the unemployment rate with the lowest rate in the past 12 months. She argues when this goes above 0.5% pts, we are in a recession.\n\nTherefore, if the current three month average of the unemployment rate is 5.6%, and at some point in the past 12 months the rate was 5%, that would mean a gap of 0.6% pts and indicate a recession.\n\nThis measure is similar to my ready guide of looking at the 12 months change in the unemployment rate.\n\nIndeed both measures have very similar \"peaks\", and both would indicate that we had recessions in 2001, during the GFC, and also went close to one from 2013-2015.\n\nYou could quibble and argue a 0.5% pt change is too small for a recession, but the reality is most times when the gap goes above 0.5% pt, it then rises to 1% pt.\n\nWe could also measure instead underutilisation and suggest a 1% pt increase is a recession. In that case we also did have a recession in 2014 and 2015.\n\nAnd what the Sahm measure also highlights is that when a recession occurs, it occurs quickly.\n\nOn average the unemployment rate does not move at all each month - a 0.1% pt move one month will be cancelled out soon after by a 0.1% pt move in the opposite direction.\n\nBut in the months before we hit a recession, the move is up, and up fast.\n\nThis is again why relying on GDP to decide if we are in a recession is silly - not only does it miss out on the important aspects of the economy, it comes too late for policy maker to do anything about it.\n\nThe good news is the current \"Sahm rule\" measure of recession is just 0.22% pts, and it has improved recently.\n\nThe bad news is things can change very quickly. This is why rather than waiting for the GDP to tell us if the bushfires and coronavirus have put us into a recession we, the government and the RBA should be watching the unemployment rate.\n\n* Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_jericho@theguardian.com", "name": "Greg Jericho", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007\u20132008", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushfires_in_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bushfires in Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guardian Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Metrology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Metrology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Growth_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Growth and Development", "wgt": 7}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a4d58f8d1833bca371685cf8dbc15560eb5583a/0_0_5176_3106/master/5176.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=87b4ebd70307436a1de0a3daea1b55c8", "eventUri": "eng-5485443", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 9}, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 9, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1435773364", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-05", "time": "05:37:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-05T05:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-05T04:48:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/05/pandemic-netflixs-new-series-about-global-outbreaks-is-eerily-timed-and-moved-me-to-tears", "title": "Pandemic: Netflix's new series about global outbreaks is eerily timed, and moved me to tears", "body": "The documentary questions our readiness for fast-moving viruses like coronavirus. It is informative, inspiring - and terrifying\n\nNetflix's new, terrifying docuseries Pandemic has dropped just as a new, terrifying virus has landed in real life.\n\nWhile coronavirus dominates news headlines, Netflix is streaming its six-part series on how prepared (or not) the world is to deal with a new pandemic.\n\nPandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak starts with a theory: that we're due for a new, fast-moving deadly virus. It's been 100 years since a deadly influenza virus killed 50 to 100 million people, at a time when the global population was just two billion (cue black and white footage of people in old timey face masks, with loads of mass graves being dug).\n\nNow there are nearly eight billion people in the world, as expert Dr. Dennis Carroll, director of USAID's Emerging Threats Unit, warns in Pandemic: \"When we talk about another flu pandemic happening, it's not a matter of if, but when.\"\n\nCould the \"when\" that haunts this scary series be now?\n\nAs of writing, the death toll of coronavirus is nearly 500 people; it has spread to 28 countries, and the global number of confirmed cases is well over 24,000.\n\nAs well as loss of life, the virus has caused widespread disruption to financial markets, workplaces, flight patterns and food production - effects predicted and examined with great flair, detail and drama in Pandemic.\n\nOne of the executive producers, Sheri Fink, is a journalist, doctor and author of the brilliant Five Days at Memorial, about unpreparedness for Hurricane Katrina. Tweeting about the uncanny timing of the series this week, she said, \"We hoped to inform before, not after, another dangerous pathogen emerged.\"\n\nAs a result of coronavirus, viewers will come to the series with an extra level of awareness of the risks of a fast-moving, mysterious virus. But don't let the fear factor put you off. Pandemic is also informative, inspiring, visually stunning and a great piece of storytelling.\n\nProduced by Zero Point Zero Productions, who also created Anthony Bourdain's shows, it introduces viewers to a range of characters whose stories unfold as the series gallops across the globe.\n\nThe heroes are the scientists, doctors and disaster experts. We follow Dr Syra Madad as she tries to get the New York City hospital system ready for a deadly pandemic, despite budget cuts. We meet Jake Glanville and Sarah Ives, two scientists who are trying to create a global one-shot flu vaccine that they can make available for free to people in developing countries. We go to Jaipur and tour the wards of an overcrowded hospital with Dr. Dinesh Vijay, and head to the poultry markets of Vietnam with Dennis Carroll.\n\nIf there is a villain here, it's not just the virus itself but misinformation that often spreads in tandem with a pandemic.\n\nUsing a similar technique to the film Contagion, the show jumps around the world - from ICE holding camps on the US border, to an underfunded county hospital in Oklahoma, to protests by anti-vaxxers in Oregon, to the fight in the Congo to contain the Ebola virus.\n\nI was moved to tears multiple times - not from fear of what might be coming for us, but from the kindness and dedication of those who work in the field.\n\nHealth care workers die and get murdered while treating the Ebola virus in Africa. Indian doctors in overcrowded hospitals for the poor face 1,000 patients a day presenting with serious swine flu symptoms.\n\nThere are volunteers giving flu shots at the border, the overworked doctors who rarely see their own kids, the ambitious scientists looking for vaccines while working outside big pharma - all of it shows that people working in strong systems, with decent funding and the cooperation of governments and citizens, can make significant advances.\n\nAnd when the worst happens? According to Carroll, \"Every epidemic is an opportunity to learn.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

will not be quarantined", "body": "Qantas flight crew have raised concerns that the 14-member cabin crew responsible for bringing evacuated Australians out of China's Wuhan province will return to work staffing commercial flights around the country without a period of quarantine.\n\nA crew member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they and their colleagues were concerned about the health protocols surrounding the cabin crew, who will board domestic flights to return to their home cities and return to working on flights around the country and the world without being placed in quarantine.\n\n\"The breaking straw really for me is their response that the jumbo crew returning from Wuhan with the potentially infected passengers will not themselves be subject to any kind of quarantine, and will be back online flying with the rest of us as per usual as soon as possible, as Qantas do not deem them to be of any risk to the rest of us,\" the staff member said.\n\nThose passengers being evacuated from Wuhan will be required to spend 14 days in quarantine on Christmas Island, before being allowed to return home.\n\nQantas has said it would never have launched the evacuation operation if it was not safe for all involved and the broader public.\n\nIt said a number of additional health precautions had been put in place to manage the risk of transmission of coronavirus among passengers and crew on the flight, including health checks for passengers before boarding, masks for all onboard to be changed hourly, limited interaction between passengers and crew, and medical-grade air filters on board.\n\nThe airline said it was acting on the advice of the commonwealth chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy, that a quarantine period for flight crew was unnecessary.\n\nMurphy said Sunday: \"We think that if air crew are wearing personal protective equipment, which is probably just a mask and gloves when they're in close contact, that that would prevent them from any material exposure, and we wouldn't want them to be quarantined. But we would want them to be wearing personal protective equipment when they're in contact with passengers.\"\n\nQantas conducted two webinars where cabin crew were able to dial in to ask questions of senior management and medical officers. But several staff have reportedly said their concerns were minimised or dismissed.\n\n\"The company, in my opinion and also the opinion of most of my cabin crew colleagues, are taking an extremely negligent approach to dealing with the WHO-declared emergency, to the detriment of all of us who fly, as well as to the general public,\" the cabin crew member said.\n\nThe crew member said they were not seeking to act \"like some kind of scare-monger ... but I am deeply concerned not only for my own health and safety and that of my loved ones but also for the greater impact this can have on the Australian public, and for that matter, the global impact of this virus\".\n\nThe 14-person cabin crew and four pilots left Sydney on a Boeing 747 on Sunday afternoon. The flight travelled to Hong Kong before landing in Wuhan overnight on Sunday.\n\nThe plane left Wuhan airport at 8.03am local time. It landed at RAAF base Learmonth in Exmouth, Western Australia, about 4pm WA time. About 270 passengers and crew were on board, including significant numbers of children and the elderly, who were prioritised for the evacuation mission.\n\nThe Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, said the airline had worked closely with the Australian government, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on the \"complicated logistics\" and health protocols for the flight.\n\nJoyce told ABC radio that the additional precautions put in place to manage the coronavirus transmission risk on the flight including the crew remaining on the aircraft's upper deck. \"They are there for safety requirements, manning doors on departure and arrival. All the passengers and the crew have been given masks and hand sanitisers, and the crew have gloves.\"\n\nFood and drinks would be laid out on seats for passengers before boarding to minimise crew interaction with passengers, he said. Officials from the Department of Health would also be on board the flight.\n\nJoyce said medical-grade air filters put new air into the cabin every five minutes, making it cleaner than a restaurant or public transport. \"There is a lot of medical assistance on board, passengers are checked before they get on board, we've put in the maximum amount of protection that we can.\"\n\nJoyce said the crew had volunteered to get Australians out of Wuhan. \"There are a lot of children, a lot of elderly passengers, we need to get them home and out of Wuhan. I'm so proud of our crew that they volunteered to do this. They know there's a slight risk but the captain told me this is so rewarding that they are helping Australians in need.\"\n\nAfter flying to Exmouth, the 747 is set to fly empty to Sydney, where it would undergo \"two to three days of deep cleaning\" before returning to service, Joyce said. \"There is a specialist team that gets on the aircraft, even the cushions in every seat are taken off and cleaned. It's quite extensive and we believe more than meets the needs to make sure that the aircraft is safe.\"\n\nAfter initially saying Australian citizens and permanent residents would be charged $1,000 each by the government for transport and accommodation, those evacuated from Wuhan will not be charged at all. The Australian government is covering the majority of the cost of the charter, which will be operated at a loss by Qantas.\n\nQantas has said it will also bear the costs of flying Australians back to their home cities after they have finished their period of quarantine on Christmas Island.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"body": "Wednesday's top story: Nancy Pelosi tears up Trump's divisive State of the Union speech. Plus, what happened when a firm published its salaries online\n\nGood morning, I'm Tim Walker with today's essential stories.\n\nTrump brags of 'great American comeback' amid walkouts\n\nHours before his near-inevitable acquittal by the US Senate, Donald Trump on Tuesday delivered a State of the Union address so divisive and bullish that it prompted House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to tear up the text, saying she could not find \"one page with truth on it\". Having snubbed Pelosi's handshake before the speech, Trump bragged of a \"great American comeback\", touting the economy and fanning the flames of the culture wars, to which Democrats responded with heckles and walkouts.\n\nRush Limbaugh. Trump awarded the controversial conservative \"shock jock\" the Presidential Medal of Freedom during his address, a day after Limbaugh announced he had advanced lung cancer.\n\nRhetorical flourish? In the absence of facts, says Richard Wolffe, Trump's speechwriters turned to nonsensical rhetorical flourishes, such as \"Freedom unifies the soul\". What?\n\nSusan Collins says she will vote for president's acquittal\n\nAny lingering hope that Trump might yet be convicted in his impeachment trial was all but dashed on Tuesday when Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who had last week voted in vain to hear from witnesses, said she would choose to acquit the president on both articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of congress. Senators continued making speeches on the matter before a final vote scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPast presidents. Trump looks set to be the third president to remain in office following an impeachment trial. Tom McCarthy looks back to the previous examples for signs of what the near future might hold.\n\nButtigieg claims victory in Iowa as partial results released\n\nPete Buttigieg, the previously little-known 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, held a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders in the Iowa Democratic caucuses on Tuesday night, with 71% of precincts reporting. The partial results put Elizabeth Warren in third place, trailed by the erstwhile frontrunner, Joe Biden. The chaos of this year's caucus, apparently caused by a smartphone app, could see Iowa lose its long-held position as the nation's first primary state - and the outsize political influence that comes with it.\n\nTech mishaps. In fact, Iowa is far from the first state to see its election day disrupted by untested new technology and administrative incompetence, as Andrew Gumbel reports.\n\nCruise ship carrying quarantined in Japan over coronavirus\n\nA cruise ship carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew has been quarantined off the coast of Japan after 10 people onboard tested positive for the coronavirus. In Hong Kong, anyone arriving from mainland China faces compulsory quarantine amid efforts to prevent the further spread of the outbreak, which has killed 490 people in China and infected more than 23,000. On Wednesday morning, markets and oil prices jumped following unconfirmed reports of an effective treatment for the virus.\n\nEscape from Wuhan. Australian Daniel Ou Yang shares his experience of being onboard an evacuation flight out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak.\n\nCheat sheet\n\nAt least 138 Salvadoran migrants and asylum seekers have been murdered and dozens more raped and tortured after being deported back to El Salvador by the US between 2013 and 2019, according to a report by Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe number of homeless public school students in the US has gone up by 15% in the past three years, with more than 1.5 million students reported experiencing homelessness during the 2017-18 school year - the highest number in a decade.\n\nTwitter has said it will start to label and even remove doctored or manipulated content designed to mislead people, amid fears that partisan so-called \"deepfake\" videos could be used to interfere with the 2020 election.\n\nPolice in the Indian metropolis of Mumbai, describing their city as \"the honking capital of the world\", are trialling a new traffic light system designed to encourage patient driving by resetting the lights to red if the noise from car horns tops 85 decibels.\n\nMust-reads\n\nThe obstacles US women face under capitalism\n\nFor the Guardian's new series, Feminist Economics, Charlotte XC Sullivan explains how she made the difficult decision to give up a pregnancy for lack of paid parental leave, while Sophie Stuber finds out what happened when one firm chose radical transparency in an effort to close the pay gap.\n\nMaking federal buildings 'beautiful again'\n\nThe Trump administration has drafted an executive order mandating future federal buildings be designed in \"the classical architectural style\". But, as Martin Pengelly reports, that goes against longstanding government guidelines - not to mention the principles of 21st century liberal democracy.\n\nNew York's Amazon workers condemn warehouse conditions\n\nAmazon has signed a deal to expand its New York warehouse space by 450,000 sq ft. But employees are unhappy about their working conditions at the city's existing warehouse sites, which, they tell Michael Sainato, are both unfair and unsafe.\n\nThe unsettling art of the American deep south\n\nA landmark exhibition in Margate, England, collects the esoteric art of Alabama and its near neighbours in the US deep south to tell a secret history of black America, writes Lanre Bakare.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe World Health Organization is facing criticism for how it allowed China to handle the early days and weeks of the coronavirus outbreak. But health diplomacy with an increasingly authoritarian Beijing is a difficult business, writes Peter Beaumont.\n\n[The coronavirus outbreak] asks how the UN's international health diplomacy, confronted with a potential pandemic where a timely and accurate flow of information is crucial, should interact with one of the world's most powerful, and controlling, states.\n\nSport\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars are to play two \"home\" games in London next year, potentially strengthening links with the UK as the franchise looks for ways to increase its revenue to compete with traditionally richer NFL sides.\n\nBarcelona is facing a crisis after Lionel Messi publicly called out the Catalan soccer giant's sporting director, his former teammate Eric Abidal, accusing him of tarnishing reputations by blaming players for the recent sacking of the team's coach, Ernesto Valverde.\n\nSign up\n\nThe US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

outbreak", "body": "Statement attributes move to drop in tourism and decision by authorities to shut Macau casinos\n\nMelco Resorts, the casino group controlled by the Hong Kong magnate Lawrence Ho, says it has abandoned its plans to buy shares in James Packer's Crown Resorts because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe move, which leaves Melco with its existing 10% stake in Crown, comes as the former New South Wales supreme court judge Patricia Bergin prepares for public hearings into Crown that are set to investigate the original Melco deal.\n\nIn May last year Melco agreed to buy almost 20% of Crown from the company's biggest shareholder, Packer, in a transaction spread across two tranches.\n\nThe first 10% was transferred in July but in August Ho and Packer pressed pause on the transfer of the remaining shares until after the end of the Bergin inquiry, which was prompted by a series of media reports making allegations including money laundering at Crown casinos and organised crime involvement in running junkets.\n\nCrown denies all the allegations.\n\nMelco's decision means it will no longer seek a seat on the Crown board, a move that will avoid scrutiny of its nominee under Australian casino regulator probity rules.\n\nAccording to research by the ratings agency S&P, Melco faces more danger from the coronavirus outbreak than Crown because it operates casinos in the Chinese territory of Macau, a former Portuguese colony close to Hong Kong.\n\nS&P said Melco \"has limited flexibility to absorb a prolonged and severe decline in its cash flow\" because it needs money to build an expansion to its Studio City casino in Macau, where casinos have been closed due to the virus.\n\nIn a statement released late on Thursday, Melco said that \"due to the impact of the coronavirus epidemic, including the severe drop in tourism in Asia to Integrated Resort (IR) facilities in the region, and the recent decision by the Macau SAR government to close all casinos in Macau, Melco has taken the decision to reassess all non-core investments to be made in 2020\".\n\n\"As a result of this decision, Melco will not pursue its planned investment in Australia for the second tranche of shares in Crown Resorts Limited.\n\n\"While Melco believes Crown has world-class assets that are complementary to its global business, it is Melco's belief that, at this time, its capital needs to be deployed on its core assets.\"\n\nThe company said it would focus its resources on projects including extending Studio City and building its City of Dreams Mediterranean casino in Cyprus.\n\n\"Management attention will remain focused on these critical areas of Melco's business until such time as operations and business throughout Asia have returned to normal,\" Melco said.",
