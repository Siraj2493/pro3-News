They are the first instances of the illness spreading to Chinese cities outside Wuhan, where cases were first discovered.\n\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement that 136 cases of coronavirus emerged in the city on Saturday and Sunday. This is a significant jump from the 62 reported on the weekend.\n\nThere are fears the number may jump during the start of this week's lunar new year holiday, when millions travel for family celebrations.\n\nThe new strain of the Sars-like coronavirus has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed more than 750 people globally in 2002-03.\n\nTwo people have died in Wuhan from the virus, that has previously been thought to be linked to the Huanan seafood market. But the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Sunday that some of the new cases did not appear to be linked to the market.\n\nNo human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan's health commission has previously said the possibility \"cannot be excluded\".\n\nThere have been two cases reported in Thailand and one in Japan.\n\nOn Saturday the WHO said the patient in Japan had travelled to Wuhan in alate December but did not visit the Hunan seafood market or any other live animal markets.\n\n\"He has indicated that he was in close contact with a person with pneumonia,\" the WHO said.\n\nThe WHO's says although the cause of the outbreak is not known, it said it is prudent to avoid contact with people suffering from \"acute respiratory infections\".\n\nCommon signs of new coronavirus infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, the WHO said. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n\nWith Reuters", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

"body": "Three Chinese cities accounting for an area of 20 million people have been put on lockdown in an attempt to contain a deadly virus.\n\nOn Thursday, authorities banned transport links from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, as well as the nearby central Chinese cities of Huanggang and Ezhou, suspending buses, subways, ferries and shutting the airport and train stations to outgoing passengers.\n\nThe blockade comes as at least 633 people have been infected with the coronavirus, from the same family of viruses that gave rise to Sars. Officials worry the upcoming lunar new year holiday, when hundreds of millions of Chinese will criss-cross the country, will exacerbate an outbreak that has reached almost all of the country's provinces, as well as the US, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Macau and Hong Kong.\n\nChinese authorities said on Thursday that 95 patients were in critical condition. So far, 17 people have died since the virus was detected in late December, all of them in Wuhan.\n\nIn Wuhan, supermarket shelves were empty and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and isolated themselves at home. Petrol stations were overwhelmed as drivers stocked up on fuel, exacerbated by rumours that reserves had run out. Local residents said pharmacies had sold out of face masks.\n\n\"When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little too late now. The government's measures are not enough,\" said Xiao, 26, a primary school teacher in Wuhan, who asked not to give her full name.\n\nFew pedestrians were out and families cancelled plans to get together for the lunar new year holiday. Special police forces were seen patrolling railway stations. Residents and all government workers are now required to wear face masks while in public spaces. Most outbound flights from Wuhan's Tianhe airport were cancelled.\n\n\"To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,\" Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization's representative in China, told the Associated Press in an interview at the WHO's Beijing office. It has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.\"\n\nThe illnesses from a newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China's Hubei province. The vast majority of mainland China's cases have been in the city.\n\nThe significant increase in illnesses reported just this week come as millions of Chinese travel for the lunar new year, one of the world's largest annual migrations of people. Chinese are expected to take an estimated 3 billion trips during the 40-day spike in travel.\n\nWhile state broadcaster CCTV has largely ignored the outbreak to emphasize traditional observances of the festival, reports have filtered in of events such as temple fairs being canceled in cities including Beijing.\n\nAnalysts have predicted the reported cases will continue to multiply.\n\n\"Even if [the number of cases] are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,\" said the WHO's Galea said, adding, however, that the number of cases was not an indicator of the outbreak's severity, so long as the mortality rate remained low.\n\nThe coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the Sars outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, which developed from camels.\n\nChina is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of Sars. For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid WHO experts.\n\nIn the current outbreak, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasized that as a priority.\n\nThe WHO plans another meeting of scientific experts Thursday on whether to recommend declaring the outbreak a global health emergency, which it defines as an extraordinary event that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lily_kuo@theguardian.com",

will apply to flights from region of China hit by outbreak of virus\n\nPeople arriving at Heathrow from the Chinese city hit by a coronavirus outbreak will enter through a separate area in an attempt to prevent the virus from reaching the UK, the transport secretary has said.\n\nPublic Health England is implementing a series of precautionary measures, said Grant Shapps. \"There have been some announcements this morning about flights that come direct from the affected region to Heathrow with some additional measures there,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"At the moment Public Health England have moved this from 'very low' to 'low' but obviously we want to stay ahead of the issue so we are keeping a very close eye on it.\n\n\"Initially this is to ensure that when flights come in directly into Heathrow there is a separate area for people to arrive in.\"\n\nLater on Wednesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, is expected to provide further details of a series of \"port measures\" that are also likely to include a health team to meet direct flights from the city of Wuhan in the isolated area of Heathrow's Terminal 4, and on-flight announcements and leaflets encouraging anyone feeling ill to report to the health team.\n\nThere are three direct flights a week from Wuhan to Heathrow.\n\nThe UK safety measures come as the World Health Organization is expected to declare an international public health emergency over the virus - as it did with swine flu and Ebola.\n\nNine people have died and hundreds have been infected with the virus, which is understood to have originated in Wuhan in eastern China. Most cases have been in Wuhan but the virus has also spread to other Chinese cities, and has also been detected in countries including the US, Japan and South Korea.\n\nAhead of the lunar new year on Saturday 25 January, Chinese authorities have advised against travel into and out of Wuhan, adding that the country is now at the \"most critical stage\" of prevention and control.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office has updated its advice for Britons travelling to China, warning the virus had spread to other areas outside the Hubei province. The illness comes from a new coronavirus, not previously identified in humans, that Chinese health officials said had spread from human to human and may be mutating.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars).", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

"There is an \"increased likelihood\" that the coronavirus causing illness and deaths in China will arrive in the UK, but the authorities are well-prepared and will remain vigilant, the health secretary has told MPs.\n\nThere are 571 cases and 17 deaths confirmed so far by the Chinese government, Matt Hancock said in a statement to the House of Commons, but those numbers will increase. \"This is a rapidly developing situation and the number of deaths and the number of cases is likely to be higher than those that have been confirmed so far and I expect them to rise,\" he said.\n\nHancock was speaking as the World Health Organization's emergency committee met for a second day to decide whether to categorise the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. On Wednesday, the committee was divided and the director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, ruled they would consider more evidence before making a decision.\n\nHancock told the Commons that the UK was one of a few countries to have already developed a test for the latest coronavirus, so any suspected case can be diagnosed quickly. However, the symptoms do not develop for five to seven days and sometimes even up to 14, meaning the virus can circulate undetected.\n\nThe UK has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began and all deaths have occurred, and which is now under lockdown by the Chinese authorities. While the UK has put in place measures to check passengers at Heathrow arriving from Wuhan, flights out of the city have been stopped by the Chinese government.\n\n\"The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from very low to low and concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well-prepared and well-equipped to deal with them,\" Hancock told MPs.\n\nSome people arriving on the last flight from Wuhan on Wednesday said they had not received any health checks at Heathrow, MPs pointed out. Handing out information was the key thing, Hancock replied. \"The most important part of the monitoring is to ensure everybody knows what to do if the symptoms arise.\"\n\nSeveral MPs said there were substantial numbers of Chinese students at universities in their constituencies. There was no specific advice for students, other than the general advice, Hancock said. \"I'm very happy to take away the point that we will ensure we are communicating through Universities UK with all universities, to make sure the message gets to all students directly and they hear the advice that is there for everybody.\"\n\nThe Labour MP Hilary Benn asked what advice would be given to the public about the use of face masks, which they would see being used in China and elsewhere on the television. \"People look at what people are doing in countries where the disease has taken hold and ask the authorities, 'Why aren't we doing the same?'\" said Benn.\n\nHancock replied: \"The wearing of face masks is not deemed clinically necessary now, but we will keep that under review and will be guided by the science.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_boseley@theguardian.com", "name": "Sarah Boseley", "type":

toll hits 41 - updates", "body": "The People's Daily has released a photograph of Liang Wudong, the doctor who died in Wuhan from the virus.\n\nHere's a what we know so far about the spreading coronavirus.\n\nA 62-year-old doctor, Liang Wudong, has died from the virus in Wuhan after treating patients. Reports say a second doctor Jiang Jijun also died from a heart attack after becoming exhausted from attending to patients.\n\nChinese authorities confirmed on Saturday that 41 people had died from the virus and over 1,300 have been infected globally. 56 million people in 18 provinces are now subject to travel restrictions. China has ordered nationwide measures to identify and immediately isolate suspected cases of a deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses. Shanghai has shut all cinemas until 30 January to try to stop the spread of the virus China's Haikou city, the capital of the southern island province of Hainan, will start a 14-day centralised medical observation for tourists from the central Hubei province 1,200 military medical personnel have been sent to Wuhan to help with the outbreak, according to state media. Australia reported it's first confirmed case of the virus - a man in his 50s who had returned from China and had visited Wuhan. Malaysia reported a third case of the virus on Saturday. Japan confirmed its third case. In the UK, 2,000 travellers who have arrived recently from Wuhan are being sought. Fourteen people tested negative for the virus. 12 countries outside China have confirmed cases.\n\nThe race is on to build a new hospital in Wuhan to treat patients infected with the virus. Here is a timelapse of the work so far:\n\nThere are reports on the Global Times that a second doctor has died. It says Jiang Jijun died from exhaustion from treating patients.\n\nWe've updated our explainer on where the virus has spread to:\n\nThis from Agence France-Presse:\n\nChina has ordered nationwide measures to identify and immediately isolate suspected cases of a deadly virus on trains, aeroplanes and buses, as the death toll and number of patients has skyrocketed.\n\nInspection stations will be set up and passengers with suspected pneumonia must be \"immediately transported\" to a medical centre, the National Health Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe isolation of suspected cases must be followed by disinfection of the train, plane or bus.\n\nThe statement said \"all departments of transportation\" must \"strictly\" introduce prevention and control measures including screening measures in airports, railway stations, bus stations and ports.\n\nA statement from Japan's health ministry said the new patient was a woman in her 30s who arrived in the country on 18 January with no symptoms. She developed a cough and fever on the 21st. The statement said she had not visited the seafood market in Wuhan.\n\nTo bring our numbers up to date - 56 million people are now subject to restrictions on their movement as authorities expanded travel bans in central Hubei province, now affecting 18 cities.\n\nJapan has reportedly confirmed its third case of the coronavirus.\n\nOne doctor is reportedly infected in Beijing.\n\nMore signs that new year's celebrations are off and many people are staying away from public places:\n\nAustralia's prime minister Scott Morrison has released an update on the virus:\n\nChinese news website Caixin has a snapshot of what reporting on the outbreak in Wuhan during Lunar new year is like. In the piece Gao Yu describes rumours flying around the hospitals, including that patients were attacking doctors.\n\nNone of these things were true.\n\nOverall, the city still operates in an orderly fashion. But shortages of medical devices and the fact that most local medical staff are incredibly overloaded are indeed severe problems. And most worryingly of all is the continuous spread of the virus...\n\nBack in our hotel, we found protective gear waiting for us kindly donated by people we don't even know, sent from around the country.\n\nThe three of us are the only customers of this hotel. They keep operating just for us, and put a small gift of fruit in our room - it's the new year after all.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

lockdown", "body": "Supermarket shelves are empty and face masks have sold out as residents of city at the centre of the deadly virus hoard supplies and retreat inside\n\nA sense of panic has spread in Wuhan as the central Chinese city was put on lockdown in an attempt to quarantine a deadly virus believed to have originated there.\n\nOn Thursday, authorities banned all transport links from the sprawling city of about 11 million people, suspending buses, the subway system, ferries and shutting the airport and train stations to outgoing passengers.\n\nSupermarket shelves were empty and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and isolated themselves at home. Petrol stations were overwhelmed as drivers stocked up on fuel, exacerbated by rumours that reserves had run out. Local residents said pharmacies had sold out of face masks.\n\nFew pedestrians were on the street and families cancelled plans to get together for the Chinese New Year holiday. Videos posted online showed highway routes out of the city had also been blocked. Special police forces were seen patrolling railway stations.\n\n\"When I saw the news when I woke up, I felt like I was going to go crazy. This is a little late now. The government's measures are not enough,\" said Xiao, 26, a primary school teacher in Wuhan, who asked not to give her full name.\n\nSome residents posted photos of their newly bought supplies of instant noodles and snacks on social media. \"No more going out ... so I won't get sick,\" wrote one internet user on Weibo, adding: \"Hope Wuhan can get some support soon.\"\n\nOthers said the elevators in their apartment complexes were being disinfected, and that most of their friends and relatives in the city were also planning on staying in as much as possible.\n\nThe blockade comes as at least 571 people have been infected with the coronavirus, from the same family of viruses that gave rise to Sars. It has now reached more than half of the country's provinces, as well as the US, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand and possibly Hong Kong. Chinese authorities said on Thursday that 95 patients were in critical condition.\n\nSo far, 17 people have died since the virus was detected in late December, all of them in Wuhan, where a seafood market selling wild animals is the suspected source of the virus. Scientists believe it likely jumped from an animal to a human and is now transmissible from one person to another, and could mutate further.\n\nOn Thursday, some residents raced to leave Wuhan before the de-facto quarantine was put into effect at 10am, lining up at the airport and at train stations. Local authorities, announcing the emergency measure at around 2am on Thursday, said citizens would be notified later when the restrictions were lifted.\n\nAnxiety has been exacerbated by reports that sick patients are being turned away from hospitals without enough room. \"Infected people could be right beside you and you wouldn't know. That is what is scarier,\" said Xiao, who has not left home since 19 January.\n\nWuhan's disease prevention and control centre released a statement on Thursday asking residents not to panic and not to stockpile. \"At the present time, Wuhan's reserves of food, medicine and other supplies are all enough,\" it said.\n\nAuthorities have made an effort to update citizens regularly on the situation and state media have attempted to frame the current shutdown as a battle being waged by the people of Wuhan for the good of the country. The state-run People's Daily posted on Weibo: \"Come on Wuhan, let us win this disease prevention war together!\"\n\nBut residents are wary of the information provided by their government, which in recent weeks repeatedly said the virus was not serious and was still \"controllable\".\n\n\"I am a bit panicked because before the government said it wasn't serious so no one thought it was a big deal,\" said Wang Ying, 26, a government worker who described going out amid large crowds on New Year's Eve, despite the virus being detected then.\n\n\"Then this morning, Wuhan was suddenly sealed off. I think the government's early warnings were not enough.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Lillian Yang", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

is the virus causing illness in Wuhan?\n\nIt is a novel coronavirus - that is to say, a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the centre of the Chinese city. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.\n\nWhat other coronaviruses have there been?\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. Although Mers is believed to be transmitted to humans from dromedary camels, the original hosts for both coronaviruses were probably bats. The first cases of Sars were in China in late 2002. The authorities played them down and were subsequently much criticised because the virus spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of around 2,500 people who have been infected.\n\nWhat are the symptoms caused by the Wuhan coronavirus?\n\nThe virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. Antiviral drugs may be used, but usually only lessen the severity of symptoms. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get breathing support as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.\n\nIs the virus being transmitted from one person to another?\n\nHuman to human transmission is now thought to be a real possibility, although it is not happening easily as was the case with Sars. As of 20 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged 139 cases, double the number previously reported, and three deaths. Modelling carried out by Imperial College experts has suggested there might be more than 1700 cases. Those that are mild may not be detected at all.\n\nHow worried are the experts?\n\nThere are fears that the coronavirus may spread more widely and person to person during the Chinese New Year holidays at the end of this month, when millions of people travel home to celebrate. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and anxious that the virus will become more potent than so far appears.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_boseley@theguardian.com", "name": "Sarah Boseley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromedary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dromedary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebola virus disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiviral_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antiviral drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transmission (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 56}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e10976f8b34a0660419dec4596e62de967e1f4c/121_684_5098_3058/master/5098.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=bf222f083128260b65331b3240a1c6bd", "eventUri": "eng-5439077", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 376}, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 376, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1420875242", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-23", "time": "15:59:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-23T15:59:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-23T15:51:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-china-virus-flu-scotland-testing-wuhan-live-news-updates", "title": "Coronavirus: four tested in Scotland after arriving from Wuhan - live news", "body": "In case you have not been following the story of the coronavirus outbreak, here is an outline of the past three weeks of developments, since first reports began emerging from China at the beginning of the month.\n\nIt is around three weeks since the first cases emerged in Wuhan, east China, of an unexplained viral pneumonia, sparking fears of a recurrence of the Sars outbreak of 2002-03 that killed more than 700 people.\n\nBy 5 January, 59 suspected cases of the new outbreak had been diagnosed, with the most common symptom being fever, with shortness of breath and lung infections appearing in a smaller number of cases. They were being isolated while they received treatment.\n\nMost of the cases were of workers, handlers or frequent visitors to one food market in Wuhan city, the Huanan South China Seafood Market. On 11 January, the disease claimed its first victim, a 61-year-old man who was a regular buyer at the Huanan market.\n\nAs alarm spread, the World Health Organisation said that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) could be the cause of the outbreak. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Sars. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes Mers are far more severe\n\nThe outbreak came at a particularly mobile time for Chinese, with millions on the move to be with loved ones ahead of the lunar new year, so it was inevitable that the virus would spread. The first case outside China was detected in Thailand on 14 January, in a woman who had travelled to the country from China. Japan confirmed its first case two days later, but as recently as last weekend - and despite a second death in China from the virus - no screening was taking place in airports in the UK or Australia.\n\nOn Tuesday US and Australian health officials announced their first domestic cases, at the same time as Chinese doctors confirmed human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus and airports around the world began introducing screening checks for visitors from affected regions.\n\nAt First Minister's questions this morning, Nicola Sturgeon gave assurances that the Scottish government and its health protection agency were closely monitoring the situation. She said:\n\nI should say that the risk to the public in Scotland and, indeed, in the United Kingdom is currently classified as low, but obviously that is kept under review. Health Protection Scotland is liaising with national health service boards and is currently in daily contact with Public Health England and liaising daily with colleagues in the UK Department of Health and Social Care. We are also paying close attention to the decisions of and advice from the World Health Organization.\n\nEnhanced monitoring measures have been implemented for flights from Wuhan city to Heathrow. Those will involve each flight being met by a port health team, who will check for symptoms of coronavirus and provide information to all passengers. We are considering whether any further information could helpfully be provided at Scottish airports. Obviously, the situation is evolving and we will monitor it extremely closely. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport or I will ensure that Parliament is appropriately updated in the days and weeks to come.\n\nWelcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIn the latest developments, four people in Scotland are being tested for the virus, as the World Health Organization's emergency committee meets for a second day to decide whether to categorise the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nThe head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, Prof J\u00fcrgen Haas, said he believed there would be many more cases from other cities in the UK. He said three suspected cases were in Edinburgh and the other was believed to be in Glasgow.\n\nTests are being carried out and none of the patients have yet been confirmed as having the virus. They all travelled to Scotland from Wuhan in China, where the outbreak is thought to have originated, within the past two weeks and are showing symptoms of respiratory trouble - a red flag for the virus.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "damien_gayle@theguardian.com", "name": "Damien Gayle", "type": "author", "isAgency":

"On 12 January Huang got news his healthy 65-year-old mother had been checked into a hospital in the central Chinese city of Wuhan with a fever and a cough.\n\nThere had been reports of a strange new virus with similar symptoms, and the hospital staff were dressed in full hazmat suits. Still, Huang's mother was not tested for the mystery illness, nor quarantined from other patients.\n\nOn 14 January she took a turn for the worse and was slipping in and out of consciousness. A CT scan showed her lungs covered in white nodules. The next evening, Huang's brother and father watched her die. The official cause of death was severe pneumonia. Two doctors told the family privately that she had probably contracted the virus, but provided no documentation.\n\nThe hospital pressured the family to immediately cremate Huang's mother, but they refused, asking for more information. Eventually they relented and workers from a funeral home, also in protective clothing, retrieved, cremated and buried her within a few hours, leaving the family no time to say goodbye. Afterwards, the staff disinfected the van they had travelled in and threw away their hamzat suits.\n\n\"My mother's death was dealt with without any dignity,\" said Huang, 40, who did not want to give his or his mother's full name. \"She wasn't even counted as a number on the government's list,\" he said, referring to the six people authorities say have been killed by the virus.\n\nChina is on high alert as a new strain of coronavirus - first detected in Wuhan - spreads across the country. If hospitals are not screening for the virus then the number of cases, and deaths, could be much higher than those cited in official reports.\n\nAuthorities reported three more deaths on Tuesday: an 89-year-old male, a 66-year-old male and a 48-year-old female. The government has confirmed 291 cases, with 270 of them in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital.\n\nCases have been confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province - and suspected cases have been flagged in 13 provinces across the country - many of them hundreds of miles away from Wuhan. Fifteen health workers in Wuhan have also been infected, according to authorities.\n\nThe number of confirmed infections is likely to have been underestimated, according to international public health experts, who say there could be as many as 1,700 cases.\n\nOn the microblog Weibo, another Wuhan resident posted images of her diagnosis of viral pneumonia and described the long queues of patients with similar symptoms late on Monday night, none of whom appeared to have been tested for coronavirus. \"Could all these people suddenly have viral pneumonia?\" she said.\n\nAnother Weibo user complained earlier this month that his father showed the symptoms of the virus but was sent home from the hospital without any screening. The post later disappeared.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said the recent rise in cases is a sign authorities are now more aggressively screening for the virus. It will consider declaring an international public health emergency - as it did with swine flu and Ebola - on Wednesday.\n\nThe Chinese political body responsible for law and order said on Tuesday that lower-ranking officials who covered up the spread of the virus would \"be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity\".\n\nDuring the Sars outbreak in the early 2000s, China initially initially withheld information about from the public and vastly under-reported cases of infection. The virus, which was also caused by a coronavirus, killed 774 people.\n\nLate on Monday, China's National Health Commission confirmed that the new virus could be spread through human-to-human contact, heightening fears before the country's week-long lunar new year holiday, which starts on Friday and during which hundreds of millions of people travel across the country.\n\nOn Tuesday internet users posted photos of shops with shelves emptied of face masks. The price of protective face masks sold online has at least doubled, prompting criticism from the state-run China Daily paper, which described the behaviour of sellers as \"immoral\". In Beijing, many commuters wore masks indoors and on the subway.\n\nIn Wuhan, authorities have begun to control the number of people leaving and entering the city, according to state TV. Guards are keeping 24-hour watch of the now closed Huanan seafood and animal market, suspected as the source of the outbreak. Large tour groups are barred and random spot checks are being conducted on vehicles coming in and out of the city to see whether they carry live animals.\n\nAdvice online has ranged from washing one's hands to not using the self-service screens at McDonald's. Some people said they had cancelled plans to travel home for the holidays. Some internet users posted notices from their employers giving them permission to work from home this week.\n\nAt the crematorium in Wuhan, Huang said he met one other family whose relative had died in similar circumstances.\n\nHe was not sure how his mother would have caught the virus. She had not gone to the seafood market, and was healthy and active. \"Everyone said she was a good person - always helping people,\" he said. \"In the end, she died alone and no one had a chance to say goodbye.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lily_kuo@theguardian.com", "name": "Lily Kuo", "type": "author", "isAgency":

China", "body": "Each evening, under cover of darkness, hundreds of live pigs from farms across China are trucked through the rusting gates of a cluster of mildew-stained quarantine and inspection buildings in the Qingshuihe logistics zone in Shenzhen.\n\nOvernight they are checked for illness, primarily the African swine fever (ASF) that is expected to kill off a quarter of the world's pigs, and reloaded on to ventilated trucks with dual mainland China and Hong Kong licence plates.\n\nBefore sunrise the caravan makes its way five-and-a-half miles south to the border at Man Kam To, a small customs and immigration checkpoint, where the pigs go through further visual health checks before crossing into Hong Kong.\n\nThey are bound for Sheung Shui slaughterhouse, the largest of three abattoirs in the territory. Once there they will be checked again before being dispatched in less than 24 hours under new rules meant to prevent the spread of ASF.\n\nIt's a lot of effort to get fresh meat from the 1,400 pigs that cross the border each day.\n\nThe appetite for freshly slaughtered 'warm meat'\n\nFor various reasons, the Chinese prefer freshly slaughtered pig, chicken and beef over chilled or frozen meat that has been slaughtered before being shipped.\n\nThat desire is at the heart of why diseases such as avian flu in poultry and ASF have been so difficult to eradicate, with huge movements of live animals from all over the country - from farm to slaughterhouse to market - on a daily basis making controlling the spread of disease incredibly difficult.\n\nA recent coronavirus outbreak in China has been linked to a wet market in Wuhan, eastern China. Like other respiratory illnesses, the disease was initially transmitted from animal to human, but is now being passed human to human.\n\nBut despite awareness of the issues, the markets are a huge part of Chinese life. On a busy morning at a so-called \"wet market\" in the Shajing area, the oldest inhabited and very Cantonese part of Shenzhen, hundreds of shoppers arrive soon after daybreak. Slabs of pork hang from the stalls and various cuts are piled on the counters amid lights with a reddish glare and the occasional buzzing of flies.\n\nJust a few minutes away at the nearby Walmart, where there are also options for fresh, chilled and frozen meat, the customer flow at this time of day is only a trickle compared to the wet market. It has your average western supermarket vibe - white daylight lighting, sterile and clean.\n\nStaff at the meat counter in Walmart and at the stalls in the wet market both say the meat comes in from the same slaughterhouse around 2am. So why the huge difference in foot traffic?\n\nMolly Maj, a corporate communications representative for Walmart, says \"the average customer in China still prefers fresh meat\" over other options.\n\nOne reason for the demand for wet markets is that widespread refrigeration only came to China in recent years. While most urban homes now have refrigerators, many in rural areas and low income urban renters still do not own one, or only a mini-fridge if they do.\n\nThe habit of buying perishable food for daily use is still prevalent in many consumers, particularly older shoppers who grew up without refrigerators. They say they can tell the quality of fresh meat by its smell, colour and how it feels to the touch.\n\n\"When I'm talking with my students I say: 'The term warm meat, fresh meat, sounds disgusting to me, I grew up [in Germany] with chilled meat, that's all I know,\" Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary medicine at City University in Hong Kong and an expert on diseases related to animal husbandry, says.\n\n\"So I ask them why and they come up with all sorts of vague things like the soup tastes better or that it is a trust issue, knowing it is a live animal at the other end and not some diseased animal,\" he says. \"It's all very subjective.\"\n\nAn 'utter disaster' for disease\n\nWet markets are central to the perception that fresh meat is better, says Pfeiffer. They evoke nostalgia among shoppers, many of whom come from rural areas where all they knew were wet markets and no refrigeration.\n\nWhere a wet market feels familiar a supermarket can seem alien and out of place.\n\n\"I actually believe that it is an important thing for the older generation to go to the wet market and chat,\" says Pfeiffer. However, the way the animal trade operates in China is \"an utter disaster\", for animal disease and welfare, he adds.\n\nA year ago, before rising concerns about the spread of ASF, nearly 4,000 pigs crossed daily with less scrutiny. Pigs were held in dismal conditions for as long as five days before being slaughtered on the Hong Kong side, greatly enhancing the possibility of disease transmission, says Pfeiffer.\n\nThe recent shortages due to the ASF outbreak have doubled and tripled prices for fresh pork at wet markets across Hong Kong. Farms in Hong Kong itself can usually supply about 300 pigs a day. Land use and environmental restrictions prevent any increase in production. The result is further worries about Hong Kong's reliance on mainland China beyond its water and energy dependence.\n\n\"Many years ago, we had imports from all over Asia of live animals, but eventually the entire supply was monopolised by mainland China,\" said Helena Wong, a member of Hong Kong's legislative council panel on food safety and environmental hygiene. \"They killed all their competitors and monopolised the supply of live pig and chicken.\"\n\nMore than 6,000 pigs at the Sheung Shui slaughterhouse were culled in May 2019 after ASF was found among animals brought in from China. Hong Kong's legislative council is now trying to figure out how much it owes traders and farmers in compensation.\n\nMassive culls of poultry due to avian flu in imported mainland chickens in the last decade also led to large compensation bills and, eventually, to ending live chicken imports in early 2016.\n\n\"We as taxpayers have to give that money,\" said Wong. \"So now we are in a big crisis because in the past few years we have experienced avian flu and now African swine fever.\"\n\nA future beyond 'warm meat' for Hong Kong\n\nDisease outbreaks have raised wider questions about the sustainability of Chinese consumers' appetite - both on the mainland and in Hong Kong - for what is often called \"warm\" meat.\n\nFor Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and an expert on animal protection in China, a deeper issue driving the live animal trade is a cultural disconnect about animal welfare.\n\n\"The main problem is the indifference or perception of people who simply regard animals as food, tools, or as things that people can do anything they want to,\" she said.\n\n\"In particular, there is no perception of farm animals as having feelings, or being capable of feeling pain or suffering.\"\n\nHong Kong may find it difficult to switch to a different model. There is almost no chance of farm expansion to support larger scale production within Hong Kong and, although the government is looking at possibilities of live imports from other Asian countries, the ports do not have adequate facilities to cope with large numbers.\n\n\"To a large extent, if we insist on fresh food, we have to rely on China,\" said Wong. \"If we can change and make certain concessions, Hong Kong has always been an open market for importing food items from many parts of the world. It is only for the provision of live animals that we are monopolised by the mainland farms.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [],

fear latest strain of virus from Wuhan may spread across world\n\nWhat is the virus causing illness in Wuhan?\n\nIt is a novel coronavirus - that is to say, a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals - possibly seafood. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.\n\nWhat other coronaviruses have there been?\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. Although Mers is believed to be transmitted to humans from dromedaries, the original hosts for both coronaviruses were probably bats. The first cases of Sars were in China in late 2002. The authorities played them down and were subsequently much criticised because the virus spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.\n\nWhat are the symptoms caused by the Wuhan coronavirus?\n\nThe virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. Antiviral drugs may be used, but usually only lessen the severity of symptoms. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get breathing support as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.\n\nIs the virus being transmitted from one person to another?\n\nHuman to human transmission has been confirmed by China's national health commission, although it does not appear to be happening easily as was the case with Sars. As of 23 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged 517 cases and 17 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside China, in the US, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, but there is definitely potential for cases to emerge due to the volume of international air travel. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be 4,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 1,000 and 9,700.\n\nHow worried are the experts?\n\nThere are fears that the coronavirus may spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms - some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true numbers infected and the extent of transmission between people. But the authorities will be keen to stop the spread and will be anxious that the virus could become more potent than it so far appears.\n\nShould we panic?\n\nNo. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World Health Organization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.\n\nHealthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children. Experts say there is no need for people to change their travel plans at this stage, but basic hygiene measures such as washing hands are sensible.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

returning from China with respiratory illness", "body": "Queensland health authorities confirm man is in quarantine at home in Brisbane and they are awaiting tests after he presented with flu-like symptoms\n\nThe first case of China's new deadly coronavirus may have reached Australia, with Queensland health authorities confirming that a man is being monitored for the condition.\n\nThe man recently returned from Wuhan, China with a respiratory illness, and has been quarantined at home in Brisbane while authorities await the results of testing that will identify if he has the condition.\n\nOn Monday China's National Health Commission confirmed human-to-human transmission of a Sars-like virus, which has spread across the country.\n\nMore than 200 people have been infected with the virus, including medical staff treating patients, and it has spread to three separate provinces as well as Beijing.\n\nOn Tuesday morning Australian health authorities said they would be implementing new screening measures for passengers flying direct from Wuhan to Sydney.\n\nMatildas coach Ante Milicic has also confirmed the FFA is monitoring the outbreak in China, where the team will play Olympic qualifiers.\n\nThe Matildas are scheduled to play three games in Wuhan, arriving next week, but Milicic says he trusts the people making the decisions will not jeopardise the health and safety of his players.\n\nChief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said Border Force staff and biosecurity officers from New South Wales Health would meet the arriving planes and provide information to passengers.\n\n\"They will be providing to all the passengers an information pamphlet in English and Mandarin, outlining the symptoms this disease might deliver and asking them to identify themselves at the border. If anyone has a fever or suspect they might have this disease and if they are suspected of having this condition, New South Wales Health will follow up as per our normal border security and biosecurity protocols,\" Murphy said.\n\nThe most common symptom is a high fever, but patients can also show other respiratory symptoms like coughing, a sore throat and breathlessness. In more severe cases, infection with coronavirus can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\n\nA Queensland Health spokesperson said the man was being tested because he had visited Wuhan.\n\n\"The man will remain in isolation until his symptoms have resolved. We are closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak in China.\n\n\"We urge anyone who has developed any respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travel to Wuhan to see their GP immediately,\" Queensland Health said in a statement.\n\nThe virus was first reported to the World Health Organisation on December 31, 2019, and identified as a new strain of the virus on January 7.\n\nStrains of coronavirus are also responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers). Sars killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03.\n\nGlobally, as of November last year nearly 2500 people had contracted Mers across the world, and 858 had died.",

"body": "Doctors have been using a robot to treat the first person known to have been admitted to hospital in the US with a new strain of the coronavirus, as part of an effort to prevent the spread of the disease, which has killed at least 17 people in China and infected hundreds more.\n\nThe man in his thirties was admitted to the special pathogen unit in a hospital in Everett, Washington, on Monday. The US citizen had recently returned from a trip to central China and had been diagnosed in Seattle.\n\nDr George Diaz, chief of the infectious disease section for Providence regional medical center, told the Guardian the patient was in a \"satisfactory condition\" on Wednesday. He did not give an update on how long the patient would remain in the unit.\n\nDiaz said he had sat outside a window of the patient's 20ft-by-20ft room to operate the robot, which was equipped with a camera, microphone and stethoscope. It is one of many ways the hospital has worked to reduce risk of the virus spreading.\n\nDiaz said the patient was picked up from his home and taken to the hospital by ambulance. He was brought to the isolation unit in an Isopod, which is a closed gurney, and then allowed to move around inside his room once it was secured.\n\nThe virus is thought to have originated around Wuhan, in Hubei province, where more than 540 people have been hospitalized. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been considering declaring the growing viral pneumonia outbreak in China to be a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nSymptoms of fever, cough and difficulty breathing have also been reported in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. Most of those confirmed to have died of the illness had previous medical conditions and were 60 or older, and all were located in China.\n\nCDC officials have said the risk to the American public is low.\n\nThis is the first time the Providence regional medical center in Everett has admitted a patient into its special pathogen unit, according to Diaz. The hospital and its staff have been preparing for the possibility since 2015, when the hospital created the unit in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\n\"Every few weeks [we're] doing drills and training like you would for an earthquake or fire drill or something like that, and so you're always trying to maintain a state of readiness,\" he said. \"The wheels were greased enough that it wasn't hard to get the process rolling to activate all the procedures that we had put in place.\"\n\nThe hospital has two rooms in the unit, but it's working on plans to prepare at least 10 additional rooms, should there be a need.\n\nThe hospital is part of a large health system made up of dozens of hospitals and hundreds of clinics and urgent care centers in seven states. Since admitting the patient in Washington state, all of these facilities have activated a screening tool for the virus.\n\n\"Now when someone, for example, wants to go to an ER, the first thing that the person on the other end will ask is have you traveled to China in the past 14 days or been close to someone who's traveled to China in the past 14 days,\" said Diaz.\n\nThere is only one entry point for the special pathogen unit, which is guarded by security officers, said Diaz. Visitors wear a special type of helmet called a CAPR, as well full body protection.\n\nWashington's governor, Jay Inslee, said in a statement on Tuesday that health departments at the local and state levels were prepared for this type of situation, and should there be other cases in the US, the state \"will continue to work to share information and help however we can\".", "source": {"uri":

passengers on flights from China for potentially fatal illness", "body": "Australia will begin screening passengers on high-risk flights from China for signs of a new Sars-like coronavirus following confirmation from the Chinese health authorities that the virus has begun spreading from human to human.\n\nThe outbreak was first reported in Wuhan City in China on New Year's Eve and tied to a seafood market, but officials have since confirmed that it has spread to other humans who had not frequented the market, as well as to health workers.\n\nAs of Tuesday, 220 people are confirmed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus - a type of virus that spreads from animals to humans - and three people have died.\n\nChief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy announced the new screening measures on Tuesday, four days after saying additional screening at points of entry into Australia was unnecessary.\n\nA handful of cases of the new virus have been confirmed in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Chinese cities other than Wuhan, all in people who had recently been in Wuhan.\n\nThere are no confirmed cases of the disease in international travellers to Australia and a number of potential passengers have been assessed by state health authorities without the presence of the disease being confirmed, Murphy said.\n\nThe new screening measures will focus on a direct flight from Wuhan City to Sydney, which flies three times a week. It will be met by Border Force staff and biosecurity officers from New South Wales Health from its next scheduled arrival on Thursday.\n\n\"They will be providing to all the passengers an information pamphlet in English and Mandarin, outlining the symptoms this disease might deliver and asking them to identify themselves at the border. If anyone has a fever or suspect they might have this disease and if they are suspected of having this condition, New South Wales Health will follow up as per our normal border security and biosecurity protocols,\" Murphy said.\n\nThe most common symptom is a high fever, but patients can also show other respiratory symptoms like coughing, a sore throat and breathlessness.\n\nMurphy said authorities were also conducting \"careful modelling\" to determine which flights form China pose the highest risk and should also be met by biosecurity staff. This includes the 160 flights that fly directly from China to Australia each week, as well as hundreds more indirect flights.\n\nInformation about the virus will be placed in Mandarin and English at all points of entry into Australia, and the Australian government will also target Chinese-language media.\n\nMurphy said temperature scanning at airports would not be reinstated because it was found during the 2009 swine flu pandemic to be \"ineffective\".\n\nOne of the cases of the virus in Thailand was reportedly detected by an airport temperature scanner.\n\n\"It missed a large number of cases ... cases that may be incubating or afebrile,\" he said. \"It leads to a false sense of security. It's not an effective public health mechanism.\"\n\nHe said Australia was well-prepared to diagnose, treat and isolate anyone suspected of having the disease, but that there was no failsafe way to keep it out of the country.\n\n\"The important thing to remember is with border screening you cannot absolutely prevent the spread of disease into the country,\" he said. \"The incubation period is probably a week. Many people who have this may present as asymptomatic. So it's about identifying those with a high risk and making sure those who have a high risk know about it and now how to get medical attention.\n\n\"There's no way of preventing this getting into the country if this becomes bigger. We need to respond to it as we always do.\"\n\nAustralia has not yet updated its travel advisory to China, but Murphy said the health department was in discussions with the department of foreign affairs and trade about providing some \"specific advice\" for Wuhan \"as the evolving situation requires.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

carrying out health checks after the virus was detected outside China\n\nCountries in Asia and elsewhere are checking the body temperatures of arriving airline passengers and adopting precautionary quarantine procedures in response to a new coronavirus that has sickened nearly 300 people in China.\n\nChina\n\nChina was blamed for making the 2003 Sars outbreak far worse by initially hiding information and blocking the work of the World Health Organization. This time, leader Xi Jinping has called for tough measures and said \"party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people's lives and health first.\" At the airport in Wuhan, the temperatures of departing passengers were checked and outbound tour groups were banned from leaving the city. Virtually everyone in a public role, from traffic police officers to bank tellers, is wearing a protective face mask.\n\nJapan\n\nOne case of new virus has been detected in Japan. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has urged officials to step up quarantine checks at airports and other entry points and visitors arriving from Wuhan, China will be required to fill in health forms. Authorities have tracked down and are monitoring 41 people who had contact with one confirmed case. None of them have developed a fever, tight chest or other initial symptoms of the new virus.\n\nHong Kong\n\nAlong with stepped-up surveillance, additional cleaning and disinfection measures have been ordered for planes and trains from Wuhan as well as for train stations and the airport. Authorities are ready for a worst-case scenario and are on extremely high alert.\n\nAs in much of mainland China, Hong Kong residents favour traditional markets where live poultry and other animals are sold. The government health department has advised people against visiting such markets or touching animals or their droppings.\n\nUnited States\n\nScreening for the coronavirus has started at three airports for flights from Wuhan: New York's John F Kennedy; and San Francisco and Los Angeles international airports. The Center for Disease Control has developed a test to detect the new coronavirus and plans to share the tool with domestic and international partners.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nAt Incheon airport near Seoul, the only airport in South Korea with direct flights from Wuhan, authorities have been operating two special gates for passengers from the city since 3 January where officials use ear thermometers to check passengers' temperatures. Handrails of moving walkways and escalators, elevator buttons and doors, drinking fountains and other sensitive areas are also wiped with disinfectant twice a day.\n\nNigeria\n\nNigeria, China's top trading partner in Africa, has asked that travellers from Wuhan report to a medical facility if they feel ill and health authorities at points of entry are on alert for cases of coronavirus.\n\nIndia\n\nIndia announced on Tuesday that it will expand thermal screening of passengers arriving from China, including Hong Kong, to seven airports from the current three. In-flight announcements before arrival will direct passengers with a fever or cough who have traveled to Wuhan in the previous 14 days to declare themselves to health authorities. Thermal screening will begin in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin, and continue in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.\n\nSingapore and Malaysia\n\nSingapore will expand temperature screening at Changi airport, one of Asia's busiest travel hubs, for all travellers on flights arriving from China beginning on Wednesday. The health ministry said individuals with pneumonia and a history of travel to Wuhan within 14 days of the onset of symptoms will be isolated in a hospital as a precautionary measure and investigated. Malaysia has also beefed up screening at Kuala Lumpur international airport.\n\nBangladesh\n\nCivil aviation authorities have ordered airport managers to start screening incoming passengers from China, looking for fevers, coughs, breathing difficulties and sore throats.\n\nAustralia\n\nBiosecurity staff and state health officials in New South Wales are meeting flights from Wuhan and are distributing pamphlets printed in English and Chinese to all passengers. The pamphlets describe symptoms of infection and ask people to identify themselves if they are experiencing any.\n\nRussia\n\nThe Russian public health service has said it has developed a testing kit that would allow labs to detect the new coronavirus quickly. Russia is one of the three most popular tourist destinations for people from China, according to Russian officials.\n\nItaly\n\nPassengers making direct and indirect flights from Wuhan, China to Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport will be checked for potential signs of the virus and people with suspected infections will be quarantined at an infectious disease hospital in Rome. Posters at the airport advise travellers to consider delaying trips to the Wuhan area and if they do go there to avoid touching animals or uncooked animal products.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinz\u014d_Abe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shinz\u014d Abe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/22/coronavirus-who-steps-back-from-declaring-public-health-emergency", "title": "Coronavirus: WHO steps back from declaring public health emergency", "body": "The World Health Organization has stepped back from declaring the growing viral pneumonia outbreak in China to be a public health emergency of international concern, saying its expert committee would meet again on Thursday to discuss more evidence from its teams on the ground.\n\n\"This is an evolving and complex situation,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO. \"Today there was an excellent discussion but it was also clear that to proceed we need more information.\"\n\nMore than 540 people have been taken to hospital with breathing difficulties and 17 have died, all in Hubei province, the Chinese authorities said on Wednesday. Many more are thought to have developed a milder form of the illness. UK infectious disease experts have doubled their estimate of the likely number of cases to 4,000.\n\nThe WHO's emergency committee met as the international spread of the virus became clear, following the diagnosis of cases in people who have travelled not only to other regions of China but also abroad. There have been cases in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and most recently, the United States.\n\nThe coronavirus is from the same family that caused 800 deaths globally from Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in 2002-03 and Mers (Middle East respiratory virus), identified in 2012.\n\nThe UK government has warned against all but essential travel to Wuhan, the centre of the epidemic, and announced checks on travellers arriving from the city. Chinese state media announced on Wednesday night that Wuhan is shutting down outbound flights and trains.\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency said the city also asked people not to leave Wuhan without specific reasons. The People's Daily newspaper tweeted that no one would be allowed to leave the city from 10am on Thursday and that train stations, the airport, city buses, subways, ferries and long-distance shuttle buses would be temporarily closed.\n\nThe novel coronavirus has been linked to a market selling seafood and live animals in Wuhan, which has now been closed. The type of coronavirus has never been identified before and it has been confirmed that human-to-human transmission is taking place.\n\nExperts believe it is quite possible the disease, which causes coughing, fever and breathing problems, will arrive in the UK. It can take at least five days for symptoms to show. The airport checks may not pick it up, but will serve to alert people to the need to get medical attention if they fall sick.\n\nProf Neil Ferguson's team at Imperial College London, who carry out disease modelling for the WHO, said they had increased their estimate from 1,700 cases at the end of last week to 4,000. However, they say there is considerable uncertainty and the true number could be between 1,000 and 9,700.\n\n\"You should not interpret that as the epidemic doubling in size in five days,\" Ferguson said. The increase was due to more information coming out of China, where doctors were struggling to deal with a rapidly evolving situation. \"All the reports I have read from within China [suggest] that hospitals are now overwhelmed with suspect cases.\"\n\nThe confirmed cases tend to be the more severe ones, in people who end up in hospital. It is possible there are many more mild cases, which do not get reported but maybe more easily transmitted from one person to another. \"It is vital we understand the rate of human-to-human transmission,\" he said. \"That will determine the feasibility of control and what measures will need to be taken.\"\n\nPeter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the University of Oxford, said there was \"quite a long latency\" after infection before serious symptoms show, starting with a mild fever and a dry cough. \"After about a week or so, they develop shortness of breath and then severe respiratory distress. About 15 to 20% of hospitalised cases are severe, requiring oxygen or ventilation.\"\n\nExperts say the spread of the coronavirus fulfils the criteria for the WHO to declare it of international concern. \"Personally, I think this is a big event,\" said Horby. \"Is it extraordinary? Yes, it pretty much is. We haven't seen this large-scale spread since Sars.\"\n\nThe death rate at the moment appears to be about 2%, which is far lower than in Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) which kills about a third, or Sars, which had a death rate above 10%. Both are also coronaviruses. The big Sars outbreak began in China in 2002 but spread globally. The Chinese authorities were criticised for failing to share information about the epidemic. There have been around 2,500 cases of Mers, which is far less transmissible, mostly in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHeathrow has put health screening in place before, notably during the huge west Africa Ebola outbreak. In that case, all arrivals from the three affected countries - Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - had their temperatures checked and filled out questionnaires about any possible exposure to the virus.\n\nThere will be warning messages during the direct flights from Wuhan, in Hubei province, said the Department of Health and Social Care, and captains will be required to report on any passenger feeling unwell before takeoff.\n\n\"This is a new and rapidly evolving situation where information on cases and the virus is being gathered and assessed daily. Based on the available evidence, the current risk to the UK is considered low. We are working with the WHO and other international partners, have issued advice to the NHS and are keeping the situation under constant review,\" said Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England.\n\n\"If you are traveling to Wuhan, you should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. Individuals should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK. They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city.\"\n\nPublic Health England has shifted its risk assessment slightly from \"very low\" to \"low\", but, said the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, \"obviously we want to stay ahead of the issue so we are keeping a very close eye on it\".\n\nMost cases diagnosed have been in Wuhan but the virus has also spread to other Chinese cities, as well as the handful of overseas cases.\n\nAhead of the lunar new year on Saturday 25 January, Chinese authorities have advised against travel into and out of Wuhan, adding that the country was at the \"most critical stage\" of prevention and control.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office has updated its advice for Britons travelling to China, warning the virus had spread to other areas outside Hubei province.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_boseley@theguardian.com", "name":

"Memories of 2003's devastating Sars outbreak cause jitters on financial markets, with Hong Kong worst hit\n\nShares have fallen across Asia Pacific amid mounting concerns about a new strain of coronavirus in China that has left at least four people dead and spread to four countries.\n\nWith the economic damage done by the devastating 2003 Sars virus still fresh in the mind of many traders, stocks were sold heavily on Tuesday and expectations grew that the markets were in for more falls in the days ahead.\n\nThe fears across the region were particularly acute given the threat of contagion as hundreds of millions travel for the forthcoming lunar new year holidays when up to 400 million are expected to be on the move across China.\n\nThe mood swing saw MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slip 1% after a steady start. Hong Kong, which suffered badly during the Sars outbreak, saw its index fall 2%.\n\nJapan's Nikkei lost 0.8% and Shanghai blue chips 1.5%, with airlines under pressure. The caution spread to futures for the S&P 500 on Wall Street which eased 0.4%, while the FTSE100 is seen falling 0.5% at the opening on Tuesday.\n\n\"Because of Chinese New Year, millions of people will make a move to their hometown across China which is making the whole situation uncontrollable,\" said Margaret Yang, an analyst at brokerage CMC Markets in Singapore, referring to the Chinese holiday period which formally begins on Friday.\n\n\"The selloff is just the beginning, we will see more in days to come.\"\n\nChina has confirmed that the virus, which causes breathing difficulty, can be transmitted from human to human. The death toll rose to four on Tuesday after an 89-year-old man died from the virus in the central city of Wuhan, which is believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak. More than 200 people have been infected across China and the region, with reports of cases in Thailand, South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe Sars outbreak claimed the lives of at least 650 people in China and Hong ong in 2002-03 and caused lasting economic damage and disruption.\n\nThe impact on the Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was not helped on Tuesday after Moody's said it had lowered its rating in a fresh blow to the financial hub, which is expected to have fallen into recession last year owing to the unrest as well as the China-US trade war.\n\nInvestors had already been guarded after the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts, mostly due to a surprisingly sharp slowdown in India and other emerging markets.\n\nThere had been some relief as Donald Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron seemed to have struck a truce over a proposed digital tax.\n\nThe two agreed to hold off on a potential tariffs war until the end of the year, a French diplomatic source said.\n\nTrump is due to deliver a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later on Tuesday, and trade and tariffs could be on the agenda.\n\nIn a tweet late on Monday, Trump said he would be bringing \"additional Hundreds of Billions of Dollars back to the United States of America! We are now NUMBER ONE in the Universe, by FAR!!\"\n\nThe Bank of Japan cited lessened trade risks when nudging up forecasts for economic growth after holding a policy meeting on Tuesday. As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its short-term interest rate target at -0.1% and a pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around 0%, by a 7-2 vote.\n\nJapan's yen picked up a bid on the safe-haven move and the dollar dipped to 109.92 from an early 110.17. It also gained on the euro, leaving the single currency flat on the dollar at $1.1092.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the US dollar was steady at 97.599, just off a four-week high of 97.729.\n\nThe Australia dollar took a knock from the flu worries since it attracts large numbers of Chinese tourists, who tend to be big spenders over the lunar new year holidays. A man was in isolation in Brisbane after complaining of flu-like symptoms following a trip to Wuhan. Australia said it would step up screening of some flights from Wuhan.\n\nThe outbreak was particularly badly timed as the tourism industry has been mauled already by bushfires sweeping the country.\n\nSpot gold edged up to $1,566.71 per ounce, and back toward a seven-year peak of $1,610.90 reached last week.\n\nOil prices hesitated, having earlier gained on the risk of supply disruption in Libya.\n\nBrent crude futures eased 31 cents to $64.89 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 5 cents to $58.49.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/21/live-animals-are-the-largest-source-of-infection-dangers-of-the-export-trade", "title": "'Live animals are the largest source of infection': dangers of the export trade", "body": "The growth of the live animal export trade will make the spread of diseases more likely, experts have warned.\n\nAlmost 30% more pigs, goats, cows and sheep were shipped, flown and driven across the world in 2017 than a decade earlier, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nThe figure is set to rise further, partly because it is still often cheaper to move live animals than use refrigerated transport, despite advances in technology.\n\nConsumer demand for fresh meat is also rising as the global population approaches 8 billion, including many who are increasingly adopting diets rich in meat.\n\nBut transporting live animals around the world increases the risk of disease transmission, according to veterinarians and epidemiologists who fear the growing industry may have already caused viruses to spread.\n\nJeroen Dewulf, a veterinarian at Ghent University in Belgium, said the introduction of the African swine fever virus (ASF) into Belgium had almost certainly been caused by human interference: either through imported contaminated animal products or by illegal movements of wild boar.\n\n\"There are several drivers of spreading diseases, but live animals are the largest source of infection,\" Dewulf said. \"The more you are going to move animals, the more you run the risk that diseases will be spread through these animals. There are other routes, the virus can be transmitted in meat products for example, but it's much more efficient to transmit via live animals.\"\n\nDavid McIver, a senior scientist and epidemiologist at biotech company Metabiota, said the rise in live animal exports was a growing issue for many other diseases, such as avian influenza virus, mad cow disease and Nipah virus, while he warned that ASF could one day feasibly threaten humans in some form.\n\n\"The first case of Nipah virus in 1998 came after an outbreak in Malaysia following the expansion of pig farming in pristine rainforest areas,\" he said.\n\n\"Bats were eating fruit, they dropped it with their saliva on it, it was eaten by pigs, then it gets into humans and there were 105 deaths. Tons of swine had to be culled to get the outbreak under control. If we're exporting those animals around the world we're potentially moving unknown pathogens to new places.\"\n\nIn another well-known case, British live cattle exports, as well as those of beef products, were banned in the 1990s due to the fear of spreading bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease.\n\nIt is believed that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare, fatal brain disorder, is likely to be caused by people ingesting meat contaminated with mad cow disease. It affects about one person per million per year around the world and there are about 350 cases annually in the US.\n\nThe authors of a study in journal BioMed warned in 2015: \"Animal trade is an effective way of introducing, maintaining and spreading animal diseases, as observed with the spread of different strains of foot and mouth disease in Africa, the Middle East and Asia and the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), for example, into Oman and Canada through the importation of infected cattle.\"\n\nMcIver added: \"Even though ASF doesn't affect humans now, pigs and people are not so different biologically and immunologically, so it is conceivable that a few small changes in the genetics of the virus can allow that to hop into people and then we've got ourselves a serious problem.\"\n\nProf Dirk Pfeiffer, from City University in Hong Kong and the Royal Veterinary College in London, said the risk depends on where you are in the world. \"It's very regulated in high-income countries with fairly effective measures in place protecting their livestock populations from spread of infectious diseases,\" he said.\n\n\"The real issue is in many of the low- to medium-income countries where there are new opportunities for money to be made, and that includes increased meat demand. Movements of live animals in these parts of the world play a role in spreading animal disease.\" In China, for example, live animals are regularly moved around the country in order to supply the 'wet markets' where butchers serve up freshly slaughtered meat. These places have long been connected with disease risk - and, indeed, the recent outbreak of coronavirus has been traced back to a wet market in Wuhan.\n\nA system managed by the World Organisation for Animal Health monitors disease outbreaks and provides information based on the reporting of affected countries. While it is praised for its role, it has to rely on prompt and honest reporting from states to be fully effective.\n\n\"One of the perverse incentives about the surveillance system is that the harder you research the more likely you'll find something, and then the country will be a victim of finding something,\" Dewulf said.\n\n\"In Belgium, for example, with the recent ASF outbreak, we were carefully monitoring, we notified all the responsible agencies, and then we faced all the consequences, such as trade restrictions, etc. In consequence, our animal industry has been hit very hard.\"\n\nBut despite the growing realisation of the need to control exports more robustly, experts warn that it would be impossible to screen all animals.\n\n\"In most cases where we look at the transmission of disease, whether in humans or livestock, we tend to see them move quicker and in more diverse ways than our surveillance systems are able to keep up with,\" McIver said.\n\nNor are these systems designed to screen live animals or meat products entering or leaving countries, he said, before warning of diseases which have not yet been identified.\n\n\"Due to the sheer volume of animals that move around, the budgets that are allocated towards it are not always sufficient and in many cases we're only able to look for things we know about. Animals may be coming or going with pathogens that are potentially really dangerous but we just haven't dealt with them yet.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

stop people leaving stricken Chinese city\n\nMorning everyone. This is Martin Farrer bringing you a taste of the best stories and features from the Guardian this Thursday morning.\n\nResidents of Wuhan have been thrown into panic after authorities placed the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak into lockdown, banning all outgoing modes of transport and advising people not to leave unless it was an emergency. People reported that supermarket shelves were being emptied and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and locked themselves at home amid an outbreak that has left at least 17 people dead and infected almost 600 more across China, Asia and the US. Petrol stations were also overwhelmed by demand as drivers stocked up on fuel and it was reported that pharmacies had sold out of face masks. Videos posted online showed highway routes out of the city had also been blocked and special police forces were seen patrolling railway stations. \"I am a bit panicked because before the government said it wasn't serious so no one thought it was a big deal,\" said Wang Ying, 26, a government worker.\n\nIn the US, doctors are using robots to treat a man in Washington state who contracted the virus after visiting China. Pacific nations that are just recovering from a deadly spate of measles are now ramping up biosecurity measures to cope with possible cases of coronavirus. Follow how the outbreak has developed and spread at our timeline here.\n\n'Sardonic message' - The United Nations has called for US authorities to investigate evidence that Jeff Bezos, the Amazon boss and owner of the Washington Post, had his phone hacked by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The UN special rapporteurs - Agn\u00e8s Callamard and David Kaye - were \"gravely concerned\" about the apparent targeting of Bezos and what appeared to be an \"effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia\". The rapporteurs, who are investigating the death of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in October 2018, said a WhatsApp account in the prince's name sent two messages to Bezos revealing confidential information about Bezos's private life. A message sent in November 2018, shortly after Khashoggi's murder, included a \"sardonic message\" along with a picture of a woman resembling a woman with whom Bezos was conducting an affair. The rapporteurs also warned world leaders in Davos who might be meeting Saudi delegates that their electronic security was \"fragile\".\n\n'Hopeful vision' - Rebecca Long-Bailey says Labour has to appeal to aspirational voters with a more \"hopeful vision\" if it is to win another election as she steps up her leadership campaign. Speaking to the Guardian for the second part of our series on the future of the party, the candidate identified as the heir to Jeremy Corbyn's brand of leftwing politics says \"the only way we ever win\" is by appealing to a broad coalition of voters. She praised the policies in the party's much-criticised manifesto but hinted that strategists failed to present them with one clear message and suggested she would shake up Labour's organisation. We also look at what the election loss means for Momentum, the 40,000-strong organisation that rose to prominence in the party during the Corbyn era.\n\nTrump 'cheat' - The lead prosecutor at the impeachment trial of Donald Trump has described the case as a national crisis and said the president tried to \"cheat\" his way to re-election. But although Adam Schiff evoked constitutional history and the global promise of US democracy to outline his case against the US president on day two of the trial in Washington, Republicans remained unmoved about the need for any new evidence. Here are five key takeaways from the day. As he prepared to return from Davos, Trump stepped up his bid for another term by indicating he would increase the number of countries subject to a travel ban to the US, cut Medicare payments and attend an anti-abortion event.\n\nJudge 'outdated' - Family court judges could be forced to undergo training on the appropriate way to deal with sexual assault cases after a woman complained about a judge's \"outdated\" views on what constituted rape. The woman has won an appeal after judge Robin Tolson said her allegations of domestic sexual violence were \"untrue\", and that she was \"not raped\" because the woman \"took no physical steps\" to stop the man.\n\nFirefighters killed - Three Americans have been killed after an air tanker they were flying crashed while tackling bushfires in New South Wales. The plane went missing in the Snowy mountains area near the border with Victoria as fires flared again in Australia amid soaring temperatures. Many American and Canadian firefighters have been in Australia to help during the fire emergency. Follow all the latest updates at our blog here.\n\nRoman ruined - Scientists studying human remains from Herculaneum, one of the Roman towns buried after the eruption of Vesuvius in AD79, have found that the heat was so intense that one victim's brain turned to glass. Experts say the vitrified brains belonged to a man of about 25 who was found in the 1960s lying face-down on a wooden bed under a pile of volcanic ash. Brain tissue is rarely discovered intact but they believe that temperatures reached 520C during the eruption, igniting body fat and vaporising soft tissue.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Peak meat - is veganism the future?\n\nMarco Springmann, a public health expert, tells Anushka Asthana why cutting out animal products is the best route to a healthy diet - and why veganism is good for the planet. Plus: Alex Hern on the Guardian's exclusive story of how the Amazon chief, Jeff Bezos, allegedly had his phone hacked after receiving a WhatsApp message apparently sent from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\n\nLunchtime read: Can Harry and Meghan become influencers-in-chief?\n\nThey are instantly recognisable, already have millions of online followers and until recently worked for a very well-known firm. So it seems a no-brainer that Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will be able to make a comfortable living as online \"influencers\", monetising their fame on social media through product endorsement and the like. But although some digital and marketing experts think the couple can take their place alongside the likes of the Obamas in the influencer elite, others aren't so sure. Elle Hunt checks out what's in store for the semi-detached royals.\n\nSport\n\nManchester City made inadmissible submissions to Uefa over financial fair play in 2014 and were reported for not making their bank statements available, the Guardian can reveal. Burnley have a famous first win at Old Trafford since 1962, but the loss for Manchester United spoke of their callowness and inability to turn possession into goals. The Australian Open needs some drama that does not involve sodden red dust falling out of the sky or players choking on polluted air - and Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka will surely provide it on day five. In rugby, the report that led to Saracens being relegated found the club's owner, Nigel Wray, broke the rules by entering into ventures totalling \u00a31.3m with England players Maro Itoje, Billy and Mako Vunipola and Chris Ashton. Tom Kohler-Cadmore accepts he was \"100% in the wrong\" to be part of the sordid WhatsApp group that emerged during Alex Hepburn's rape trial and is now trying to prevent young cricketers from doing the same.\n\nBusiness\n\nElon Musk is on course for a $50bn payout after his technology company, Tesla, surged in value past the $100bn mark. The worsening coronavirus outbreak in China sent Asian stocks tumbling again overnight. Shanghai shares were worst hit, dropping 2.75%, while Hong Kong was down 1.9%. The FTSE100 is on course for a small dip at the opening later this morning. The pound is up at \u00a31.312 and \u20ac1.185.\n\nThe papers\n\nMany papers lead with the threat to Britain from the coronavirus outbreak in China. The Mail says \"UK on killer virus alert\", the i has \"Britain on virus alert as medics fear global pandemic\", the Metro goes with \"China virus 'on the way here'\" and the Sun says \"World war flu\".\n\nThe Guardian leads again on the sensational Jeff Bezos story, splashing with \"UN demands inquiry into 'hacking' of Amazon boss\". The Telegraph also likes this story and says \"Saudi crown prince tried to 'intimidate' Amazon chief\".\n\nThe Times has a story from Davos saying \"Britain heads for clashes with US on three fronts\", while the FT has the same one: \"UK-US relations turn sour after war of words on trade and tariffs\". The Express leads with \"Boris: I want to cut taxes\". The Mirror prefers to mark the sad death of Terry Jones with a tribute from fellow Python Michael Palin: \"Terry fought dementia with laughs to the end\".\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

cover-up | Thomas Abraham", "body": "Beijing is determined to crush this disease as firmly as it crushes dissent. But there is no guarantee a lockdown will work\n\nA new disease arrives in a Chinese winter - is history repeating itself? At the end of 2002, Sars erupted in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Nearly two decades on, another new virus has struck at roughly the same time of year, this time in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\nThough the diseases are similar - Sars and the new Wuhan virus are from the same coronavirus family, and both attack the lungs - there is a great deal of difference in the way China has responded to these outbreaks.\n\nIn 2002, China was in denial and concealed the existence of Sars not merely from the outside world but from its own people. Newspapers were forbidden from reporting the disease, except for occasional statements from government officials assuring the public that there was nothing to worry about.\n\nSuch was the obsession with suppressing \"negative news\" that when a sick traveller from Guangdong arrived in Beijing, doctors there had no idea of what the illness was, and allowed it to spread in the city.\n\nThe people of Guangdong, however, knew there was something frightening going on. Nurses, doctors and healthcare workers were telling their friends and family they had never seen a disease that attacked so viciously and spread so rapidly. The provincial government's aim in Guangdong was simple: to stop local people from panicking and ensure that foreign investors and businesses were not scared away. Guangdong had set itself a GDP growth target of 12.2%, and no disease was going to be allowed to stop the onward march of the economy.\n\nThe cost of the Chinese cover-up was immense, both in human lives as well as global standing. Had China warned the world about this new disease and shared the considerable knowledge its doctors had already gained about its symptoms and its treatment, other countries would have been prepared and far fewer lives would have been lost.\n\nThe fallout from China's handling of Sars forced a move towards greater openness that has been apparent in other outbreaks of disease. In the case of the Wuhan flu, the World Health Organization as well as the public were informed on 31 December about the new disease.\n\nBy early January, the virus had been identified as a coronavirus by Chinese scientists, and its genetic sequence had been shared globally. Both of these moves were essential for an effective global response to the disease. Importantly, countries were aware of the disease before the first travellers brought it to their shores.\n\nThe greater openness in China has done little to lessen the primeval fear experienced by people confronted with a new and largely unknown disease. Virologists, clinicians and epidemiologists still know little about it, except that it is caused by a coronavirus, that the first cases appeared to be associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, and that the number of cases seems to be rising steadily.\n\nIt is unclear how severe the disease is. What proportion of people who get infected fall severely ill or die? Is this a virus that primarily causes a mild illness in people, so that most people don't even realise they have been infected, or is it a disease that hits hard, and sends most of those it infects to hospital? According to Chinese authorities, 17 people have died since the virus was detected in late December, all in Wuhan, and there have been 633 confirmed cases. The true numbers of those who have contracted the disease are likely to be much larger. There may be many more who have not gone to hospital because their symptoms are mild. We do not even know whether this disease kills more people than other common diseases such as influenza.\n\nChina seems determined to see that it does not suffer the loss of image that happened after Sars, and the unprecedented lockdown of 20 million people in Wuhan and two neighbouring cities indicates that it is determined to quash this disease as firmly as it quashes political dissent. Given the huge scientific uncertainties that exist, this may well be overkill. This is an animal virus, and according to WHO experts there is no evidence yet that it transmits easily and in a sustained way between human beings.\n\nThere is also no guarantee that a lockdown will work to contain the virus. If it is indeed spreading fast and widely, then more and more cases are going to pop up all over the country regardless.\n\nThe Sars epidemic mysteriously disappeared in the summer of 2003, nine months after it arrived. Unlike other diseases, it has never returned to the places that it once terrorised. No one knows why this is so. If China gets incredibly lucky, this new virus too could disappear.\n\nOn the other hand, if the number of cases and deaths increase, China's rulers could face something they fear more than disease itself: anger at a botched response and social discontent.\n\n* Thomas Abraham is the author of Twenty-First Century Plague: The Story of Sars", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_abraham@theguardian.com", "name": "Thomas Abraham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guangdong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangdong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_and_southern_China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern and southern China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Provinces of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_(disease)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plague (disease)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 76}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 27}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5daebd0ea1e87bd163b273620a8ecb0e16a04ceb/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=c9c95a197d9d78b2f6d3d426a57a41aa", "eventUri": "eng-5453402", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 51}, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 51, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1420875239", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-23", "time": "16:00:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-23T16:00:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-23T15:52:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/23/dont-panic-dr-matt-hancock-will-protect-us-from-the-coronavirus", "title": "Don't panic, Dr Matt Hancock will save us from the coronavirus | John Crace", "body": "Very few MPs were taking any chances with the new coronavirus outbreak in China. Which is why the Commons chamber was almost entirely empty for the ministerial statement about it. The risk of contagion is clearly deemed so high by many that even talking about it can spread the disease.\n\nFortunately the health secretary, Matt Hancock, is more selfless than many. And more fearless. One of the more charming things about Matt - other than his gullibility: he consistently remains the only person in the entire country who believes Boris Johnson will actually build 40 new hospitals - is his tireless dedication to the cause. Tigger doesn't just wear his NHS badge on the lapel of his suit, he has it attached to his pyjamas in bed at night. As does his Pooh bear teddy.\n\nMatt is so hands on and lives and breathes the NHS so much that he now rather considers himself to be the nation's doctor-in-chief, rather than a politician with no clinical experience. So for his Commons statement, he tried to adopt the serious, yet deeply reassuring, bedside tone of a disaster movie superhero who was preventing widespread panic before going back into the contaminated danger zone to singlehandedly save the planet.\n\nUnfortunately, it turned out that Tigger didn't actually have anything worthwhile to divulge. All he had was the same information that was readily available to anyone following the news. The coronavirus was primarily confined to Wuhan city in China, which was now in lockdown. There had been 511 cases confirmed with 17 fatalities, though it was possible these figures could rise. No shit. There had been isolated cases reported in the US and Japan, but none confirmed in the UK so far. But he was ready if there were as the UK was upgrading its risk level from \"Very low\" to \"Low\". He said it in a way that made \"low\" sound like a red alert. Either no one had bothered to tell him there were four suspected cases in Scotland or he just didn't want to worry anyone. \"Most people do recover,\" he added, trying not to sound too disappointed. It's hard to be appreciated as a proper saviour unless there's some jeopardy.\n\nAfter advising a few MPs, who were concerned about the wellbeing of their Chinese constituents, that the best way to avoid the coronavirus was not to travel to Wuhan or have anything to do with someone who had just returned from there, Matt then donned his white coat to give one-to-one consultations. He told the shadow health secretary, Sharon Hodgson, that there was no need for her or anyone else to worry if they were suffering from a cough as the disease typically took 10 to 14 days to gestate. Something I found particularly reassuring, as I had been up half the night hacking my guts out and had been prone to the odd hypochondriacal thought. Nice to know Matt's got my back.\n\nThere was also no need at present - at present - for anyone to wear face masks or hazmat suits but if anyone was at all concerned they were to ring the NHS 111 helpline and Dr Matt would personally be on standby to take any calls throughout the weekend. For once, though, his surgery was almost empty so the entire consultation session was over in a record 15 minutes. Most ministerial statements last a minimum of 45 minutes.\n\nBut if Matt was disappointed at the lack of referrals, he was too professional to show it. He had done his bit to keep the country safe and that's what counted. If only he could show the same diligence in other areas of his job, then people might not be dying unnecessarily due to hospitals missing their A&E and cancer targets.\n\nThere had been a rather fuller house for international trade departmental questions earlier in the day. Then there had been no risk of imminent death and many MPs had come along out of curiosity as they suspected the session might be something of a collector's item. With the withdrawal agreement having passed both houses - sorry child refugees, you'll just have to take your chances - Brexit is now a done deal, which means that we're about to get down to the much trickier, hard graft of negotiating new trade deals. And as even Boris Johnson can see that the last person you would want in charge of this is someone as catastrophically dim as Liz Truss, it's likely her days are numbered with a reshuffle imminent.\n\nStill, you have to give Truss credit. If this was to be her last outing at the dispatch box, then she was going to go out in the style on which her reputation had been built. Confusion and incompetence. She opened by heralding a new dawn of UK-US trade. She had no idea how any such deal could be agreed without first having established what levels of alignment the UK would be keeping with the EU, but she was certain that the new agreement would mean no tariffs on car exports to the US. Only for her to add in the same breath that the UK should be free to impose a digital service tax if it wanted to, even though the US had insisted it would impose tariffs on cars if we did. Go figure.\n\nI'll miss Truss when she's gone. Even if few others will. She's been very good to me. But then I said much the same when Liam Fox was sacked from the same job. My one consolation is that her successor will almost certainly be no better.

"Officials in China are searching to uncover the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, amid heightened scrutiny of the country's poorly regulated animal trade.\n\nAuthorities believe the new strain of coronavirus came from a seafood market in Wuhan where wildlife was sold illegally. The World Health Organisation has stated that an animal appears most likely to be the primary source, with experts suggesting it may have been carried by bats, badgers, rats or snakes.\n\nThe virus is from the same family of viruses as Sars, which was passed to humans from bats by the masked pam civets, and Mers, which was carried from bats to humans by camels.\n\nIan Jones, professor of virology at Reading University, said it was likely that the Wuhan virus had also been transmitted in the same way - passed from bats to humans through an intermediate host. \"Something in the local area will have picked up this virus and it's this something that would have been on sale in the wet market,\" said Jones.\n\nThough the 2002-03 Sars outbreak, which killed nearly 800 people, prompted efforts to regulate the wildlife trade in China, the tradition of eating endangered wild animals, or using wildlife to produce medicines, remains popular. Conservationists and health experts warn that such animals are being sold in unhygienic and cramped markets, allowing viruses to thrive.\n\nMedia reports suggest that about 50 wild animals, including endangered pangolins, were on sale at the market in Wuhan before it was closed at the end of last year. Photographs taken before its closure show snakes, porcupines and foxes crammed into cages. The sister of a vendor infected by the virus told China Business Journal, a state-owned paper, that snakes, ducks and wild rabbits were common at the market.\n\n\"The animal welfare part of this is obvious, but much more hidden is this stashing and mixing of all these species together in a very small area, with secretions and urine mixed up together,\" Christian Walzer, executive director of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, told Reuters.\n\nThe environment creates a perfect system to spread viruses, he said: \"You couldn't do it any better if you tried.\"\n\nResearch published on Wednesday in the Journal of Medical Virology, which used analysis of the protein codes favoured by the new coronavirus, suggested it may have been snakes at the market that passed the virus to humans.\n\nSome argue that the virus is more likely to have been passed on by a mammal. \"In my view it's very unlikely to be a snake because the jump from a reptile to a person is evolutionarily quite a long way,\" said Jones, who added that while snake handling is common in the region, he is not aware of any individuals contracting this kind of virus after direct handling of snakes.\n\nBadgers and rats were both cited as possible sources by Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan. The sale of live poultry has been banned in Wahun, where all outbound public transport has also been suspended.\n\nIdentifying the origin of the virus would not only enable officials to prevent its circulation, but could also allow scientists to understand if the virus has further evolved after infecting people.\n\nOn Wednesday, China's national health commission vice-minister Li Bin told reporters there was evidence of respiratory transmission of the virus from patient to patient. Among those infected are 15 medical staff.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"The World Health Organization has called on the global community to work together to fight the new coronavirus that is causing an epidemic of viral pneumonia and deaths in China, but stopped short of declaring it a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nAfter the second day of meetings of the emergency committee, WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Thursday that nobody should assume there was no risk that it would become a dangerous global epidemic.\n\n\"Make no mistake, this is an emergency in China,\" he said. \"But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.\"\n\nThere have been 584 cases and 17 deaths reported to the WHO so far, Tedros said, although reports from China confirmed an 18th death on Thursday in Hebei province - the first outside Hubei province, where the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan. Chinese state television put the number of confirmed cases at 634 by Thursday evening.\n\nAll the deaths and 575 cases were inside China, which is where all human-to-human transmission of the virus had so far occurred, said Tedros. \"There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China. That doesn't mean it won't happen,\" he said.\n\n\"We know this virus causes severe disease and can kill, although for most people it causes mild disease,\" he added. A quarter of those who became ill had severe disease and most of those who died had underlying poor health, such as heart disease.\n\nThere are many unknowns that need answers from the world's experts who must work together, such as the source of the virus, how easily it spreads, the clinical features and its severity. The committee's decision, he said, \"should not be taken as a sign WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we are not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth.\"\n\nPeter Piot, a professor of global health and the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak was at a critical stage and international collaboration and more resources were vital to stopping it in its tracks.\n\n\"There are still many missing pieces in the jigsaw puzzle to fully understanding this new virus, which is spreading rapidly across China and most probably around the world. Over the coming days and weeks we will know much more, but there cannot be any complacency as to the need for global action,\" he said.\n\n\"The good news is that the data to date suggest that this virus may have a lower mortality than Sars. We have a diagnostic test and there is greater transparency than decades gone by. And that is essential because you cannot deal with a potential pandemic in one country alone.\"\n\nAnxieties in the UK and around the world are already running high. The Scottish government said five people were being tested for the novel coronavirus. The Prime minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said that the tests were \"purely precautionary\".\n\nProf J\u00fcrgen Haas, head of infections at the University of Edinburgh, said he expected there would be many more suspected cases following those in Scotland that emerged overnight.\n\n\"The situation will be pretty similar in pretty much all UK cities with a large number of Chinese students. It's not too surprising. My suspicion is that there will probably be many more cases in many other cities in the UK. None of the cases I know of have been confirmed.\"\n\nThe virus has a long latency of between five and 14 days when there are no symptoms. Haas said the testing would be done by Public Health England.\n\nThe Scottish government confirmed that the patients had been in Wuhan recently. \"Following travel to Wuhan, China, two people confirmed as diagnosed with influenza are now being tested for Wuhan novel coronavirus as a precautionary measure only. Three further people are also undergoing testing on a similar precautionary basis,\" said a government spokesman.\n\n\"There are currently no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and the risk to the Scottish public remains low.\"\n\nHe said they had \"robust arrangements to manage emerging diseases and are monitoring this situation closely\". They would update the information further only if they had any confirmed cases, he added.\n\nBelfast's Royal Victoria hospital was also said to have a patient who was being tested for the new coronavirus, but the Belfast health trust refused to comment.\n\nUniversities with large numbers of Chinese students said they were giving out information and advice, encouraging them to report any possible symptoms. Dundee, which has a joint education partnership with Wuhan University, said it had advised students to be careful with any packages they might receive from the city, especially if they contained food.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control warned citizens to avoid all but essential travel to Wuhan, in line with the advice from the UK government, while Egypt and Turkey joined the growing list of countries introducing screening at ports for travellers arriving from China.\n\nThere are no treatments available for those who fall sick, although Chinese doctors will be trialling potential new drugs - particularly those already being tested for use in Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), which is a more lethal member of the coronavirus family.\n\nA programme has already been launched to speed up work towards a vaccine. Cepi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said it hoped to have a vaccine in clinical trials within 16 weeks.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The
