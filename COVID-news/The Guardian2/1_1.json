Treatments did not improve his symptoms after he was admitted to hospital and he died on the evening of 9 January when his heart failed.\n\nNo new cases had been detected since 3 January, the commission added.\n\nThe Wuhan health authority also said the patients were mainly vendors and buyers at a seafood market in the city, and that to date no medical staff had been infected, nor had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission been found.\n\nThe World Health Organisation said on Thursday that a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) could be the cause of the present outbreak.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Sars. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes Mers are far more severe.\n\nThe outbreak comes ahead of the lunar new year holidays in late January, when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be travelling to their home towns or abroad. The Chinese government expects passengers to make 440m trips via rail and another 79m trips via airplanes.\n\nThe Wuhan health authority also urged the public to take more precautions against infectious diseases and said it was pushing ahead with tests to diagnose the pathogen, as of Friday completing nucleic acid tests.\n\nHong Kong's health department said in a separate statement on Saturday that it strengthened checks and cleaning measures at all border check points, including the port, airport and the city's high-speed rail station, which receives passengers from Wuhan city.\n\nIn 2003, Chinese officials covered up a Sars outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced the government to reveal the epidemic. The disease spread rapidly to other cities and countries. More than 8,000 people were infected and 775 died.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Unlike Sars, it does not appear to spread easily between humans and unlike Mers, which has a mortality rate of about 35%, nobody has died.\n\nBut the identification in preliminary laboratory tests by the Chinese of a novel coronavirus emerging once more from animals to infect humans is worrying to global health experts. When Sars appeared in China in 2002, it was not swiftly identified and contained. It spread around the world - particularly to Canada - via travellers.\n\nJeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome and an expert in tropical diseases, said: \"Epidemics of diseases known and unknown are one of our greatest global health threats - threats that are with us constantly.\n\n\"A cluster of patients with an unusual respiratory infection is, and should always be, a worry. The level of concern raises again when the illness is linked to an animal food source. This is how new viruses jump across the species barrier - as was the case with Sars, Mers, avian flu and Ebola.\"\n\nThe source of the virus is not yet known but investigations have centred on a market in Wuhan selling live animals and seafood. The origin of Sars was eventually traced to bats in a cave in Yunnan province in China. Dromedary camels are the source of Mers, although it is thought they may also have originally been infected by bats.\n\nThe World Health Organization said in a statement that the Chinese authorities believed the disease \"does not transmit readily between people\", but that it could cause severe illness in some patients. Seven people were known to be critically ill at the weekend. The Chinese authorities have not updated the figures since Sunday. State television said eight people taken to hospital with respiratory problems had been sent home.\n\n\"More comprehensive information is required to confirm the pathogen, as well as to better understand the epidemiology of the outbreak, the clinical picture, the investigations to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and the countermeasures implemented,\" the WHO said.\n\nThe memory of Sars has already triggered precautionary behaviour in Hong Kong, where people arriving from Wuhan are being screened for the flu-like symptoms of respiratory disease. Some people have been hospitalised, but none has proved to have viral pneumonia of the type found in China.\n\nFarrar said one of the key concerns was whether the infection was passing from one person to another. \"Are doctors and nurses treating patients, or family members, who have not had the same exposure to the source, also getting sick?\" he asked.\n\n\"If the infection is not passing person to person, then the level of concern is somewhat reduced - although it can always happen later and infections can change.\"\n\nIt appeared that there had not been any newly confirmed cases in Wuhan for about a fortnight, he said, which was reassuring.\n\n\"The health authorities in China are right, therefore, to take the time necessary to carry out thorough tests and to ensure correct diagnosis. When public health responses are rushed, problems follow - as we saw with early responses to the Nipah outbreak in 1999,\" he said.\n\n\"While early identification of this new virus is testimony to vastly improved monitoring, the global health community still has much to do to address global epidemic preparedness. We are still without a vaccine or treatment for Sars or Mers, which we have long known to be epidemic threats.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_boseley@theguardian.com", "name": "Sarah Boseley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle East respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viral pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebola virus disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yunnan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yunnan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromedary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dromedary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza-like illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Epidemiology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Epidemiology", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aba06df90c757a621a501edd11398f061f98d0a4/0_23_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=20a3e78c6a048491b1a2602f8830548b", "eventUri": "eng-5411056", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 136}, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 101}], "totalResults": 3, "page": 1, "count": 3, "pages": 1}}
