As its effects spread, it could destabilise entire economies and overwhelm poorer countries lacking resources and infrastructure. But this is the climate crisis, not the coronavirus. Governments are not assembling emergency national plans and you're not getting push notifications transmitted to your phone breathlessly alerting you to dramatic twists and developments from South Korea to Italy.\n\nMore than 3,000 people have succumbed to coronavirus yet, according to the World Health Organization, air pollution alone - just one aspect of our central planetary crisis - kills seven million people every year. There have been no Cobra meetings for the climate crisis, no sombre prime ministerial statements detailing the emergency action being taken to reassure the public. In time, we'll overcome any coronavirus pandemic. With the climate crisis, we are already out of time, and are now left mitigating the inevitably disastrous consequences hurtling towards us.\n\nWhile coronavirus is understandably treated as an imminent danger, the climate crisis is still presented as an abstraction whose consequences are decades away. Unlike an illness, it is harder to visualise how climate breakdown will affect us each as individuals. Perhaps when unprecedented wildfires engulfed parts of the Arctic last summer there could have been an urgent conversation about how the climate crisis was fuelling extreme weather, yet there wasn't. In 2018, more than 60 million people suffered the consequences of extreme weather and climate change, including more than 1,600 who perished in Europe, Japan and the US because of heatwaves and wildfires. Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe were devastated by cyclone Idai, while hurricanes Florence and Michael inflicted $24bn (\u00a318.7bn) worth of damage on the US economy, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nAs the recent Yorkshire floods illustrate, extreme weather - with its terrible human and economic costs - is ever more a fact of British life. Antarctic ice is melting more than six times faster than it was four decades ago and Greenland's ice sheet four times faster than previously thought. According to the UN, we have 10 years to prevent a 1.5C rise above pre-industrial temperature but, whatever happens, we will suffer.\n\nPandemics and the climate crisis may go hand in hand, too: research suggests that changing weather patterns may drive species to higher altitudes, potentially putting them in contact with diseases for which they have little immunity. \"It's strange when people see the climate crisis as being in the future, compared to coronavirus, which we're facing now,\" says Friends of the Earth's co-executive director, Miriam Turner. \"It might be something that feels far away when sitting in an office in central London, but the emergency footing of the climate crisis is being felt by hundreds of millions already.\"\n\nImagine, then, that we felt the same sense of emergency about the climate crisis as we do about coronavirus. What action would we take? As the New Economic Foundation's Alfie Stirling points out, a strict demarcation between the two crises in unwise. After all, coronavirus may trigger a global slowdown: the economic measures in response to this should be linked to solving the climate crisis. \"What tends to happen in a recession is policy-makers panic about what the low-lying fruits are; it's all supply chains and sticking plasters,\" he tells me. During the 2008 crash, for example, there was an immediate cut in VAT and interest rates, but investment spending wasn't hiked fast enough, and was then slashed in the name of austerity. According to NEF research, if the coalition government had funded additional zero-carbon infrastructure, it would not only have boosted the economy but could have reduced residential emissions by 30%. This time round, there's little room to cut already low interest rates or boost quantitative easing; green fiscal policy must be the priority.\n\nWhat would be mentioned in that solemn prime ministerial speech on the steps of No 10, broadcast live across TV networks? All homes and businesses would be insulated, creating jobs, cutting fuel poverty and reducing emissions. Electric car charging points would be installed across the country. Britain currently lacks the skills to transform the nation's infrastructure, for example replacing fuel pumps, says Stirling: an emergency training programme to train the workforce would be announced.\n\nA frequent flyer levy for regular, overwhelmingly affluent air passengers would be introduced. As Turner says, all government policies will now be seen through the prism of coronavirus. A similar climate lens should be applied, and permanently.\n\nThis would only be the start. Friends of the Earth calls for free bus travel for the under-30s, combined with urgent investment in the bus network. Renewable energy would be doubled, again producing new jobs, clean energy, and reducing deadly air pollution. The government would end all investments of taxpayers' money in fossil fuel infrastructure and launch a new tree-planting programme to double the size of forests in Britain, one of Europe's least densely forested nations.\n\nThere is a key difference between coronavirus and climate crisis, of course, and it is shame. \"We didn't know coronavirus was coming,\" says Stirling. \"We've known the climate crisis was on the cards for 30 or 40 years.\" And yet - despite being inadequately prepared because of an underfunded, under-resourced NHS - the government can swiftly announce an emergency pandemic plan.\n\nCoronavirus poses many challenges and threats, but few opportunities. A judicious response to global heating would provide affordable transport, well-insulated homes, skilled green jobs and clean air. Urgent action to prevent a pandemic is of course necessary and pressing. But the climate crisis represents a far graver and deadlier existential threat, and yet the same sense of urgency is absent. Coronavirus shows it can be done - but it needs determination and willpower, which, when it comes to the future of our planet, are desperately lacking.\n\n* Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_jones@theguardian.com", "name": "Owen Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/coronavirus-reasons-to-be-reassured", "title": "Coronavirus: nine reasons to be reassured", "body": "Yes, Covid-19 is serious, but context is key and the world is well placed to deal with it\n\nThe coronavirus epidemic plainly poses an exceptionally serious global problem: in a few short weeks, it has spread from China to more than 80 countries, infecting more than 100,000 people so far and causing more than 3,400 deaths.\n\nBut as we are hit with minute-by-minute updates from around the world, experiencing the advance of Covid-19 in real time - news alerts, huge headlines, social media hysteria - there's a risk that we might lose some essential context.\n\nYes, this virus is obviously a massive challenge: medical, political and - perhaps most strikingly at present - social and economic. But it is worth remembering the world has never had better tools to fight it, and that if we are infected, we are unlikely to die from it.\n\nHere, courtesy of a number of scientists but mainly Ignacio L\u00f3pez-Go\u00f1i, a professor of microbiology and virology at the University of Navarra in Spain, are what might hopefully prove a few reassuring facts about the new coronavirus:\n\nWe know what it is. As L\u00f3pez-Go\u00f1i wrote for the Conversation France, the virus causing cases of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was identified within seven days of the official announcement on 31 December, and, three days after that, the gene sequence was available. The Aids virus, by contrast, took two years to identify after it first appeared in mid-1981, L\u00f3pez-Goni noted. We also know the virus is natural, that it is related to a virus found in bats, and that it can mutate, but does not appear to do so very often.\n\nWe can test for it. By 13 January - three days after the gene sequence was published - a reliable test was available, developed by scientists at the department of virology at Berlin's Charit\u00e9 university hospital with help from experts in Rotterdam, London and Hong Kong.\n\nWe know it can be contained (albeit at considerable cost). China's draconian quarantine and containment measures appear to be working. On Thursday 120 new cases were reported in Wuhan, the lowest figure for six weeks, and, for the first time since the start of the outbreak, none at all in the rest of Hubei province. Several Chinese provinces have had no new cases for a fortnight and more are reopening their schools. In many countries, infections are in defined clusters, which should allow them to be more readily contained.\n\nCatching it is not that easy (if we are careful) and we can kill it quite easily (provided we try). Frequent, careful hand washing, as we now all know, is the most effective way to stop the virus being transmitted, while a solution of ethanol, hydrogen peroxide and bleach will disinfect surfaces. To be considered at high risk of catching the coronavirus you need to live with, or have direct physical contact with, someone infected, be coughed or sneezed on by them (or pick up a used tissue), or be in face-to-face contact, within two metres, for more than 15 minutes. We're not talking about passing someone in the street.\n\nIn most cases, symptoms are mild, and young people are at very low risk. According to a study of 45,000 confirmed infections in China, 81% of cases caused only minor illness, 14% of patients had symptoms described as \"severe\", and just 5% were considered \"critical\", with about half of those resulting in death. Only 3% of cases concern people under 20, children seem barely affected by the virus at all, and the mortality rate for the under-40s is about 0.2%. The rate rises in the over-65s, reaching nearly 15% in the over-80s, especially those with pre-existing heart or lung conditions. Calculating mortality rates during an ongoing epidemic is hard because it is not clear how many mild or asymptomatic cases have been tested for, but the best estimate we have for the coronavirus so far is 1.4% - somewhere between 1918 Spanish flu and 2009 swine flu.\n\nPeople are recovering from it. As the daily count maintained by the John Hopkins CSSE shows, thousands of people around the world are making confirmed recoveries from the coronavirus every day.\n\nHundreds of scientific articles have already been written about it. Type Covid-19 or Sars-19 into the search engine of the US national library of medicine's PubMed website and you will find, barely five weeks after the emergence of the virus, 539 references to papers about it, dealing with vaccines, therapies, epidemiology, diagnosis and clinical practice. That's an exponentially faster publication rate than during the Sars epidemic, L\u00f3pez-Go\u00f1i notes - and most publications' coronavirus articles are free to access.\n\nVaccine prototypes exist. Commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology labs such as Moderna, Inovio, Sanofi and Novavax, as well as academic groups such as one at the University of Queensland in Australia - many of which were already working on vaccines for similar Sars-related viruses - have preventive vaccine prototypes in development, some of which will soon be ready for human testing (although their efficacy and safety will of course take time to establish).\n\nDozens of treatments are already being tested. By mid-February, more than 80 clinical trials were under way for antiviral treatments, according to Nature magazine, and most have already been used successfully in treating other illnesses. Drugs such as remdesivir (Ebola, Sars), chloroquine (malaria), lopinavir and ritonavir (HIV), and baricitinib (rheumatoid polyarthritis) are all being trialled on patients who have contracted the coronavirus, some as a result of the application of artificial intelligence.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

public spaces. \"Our goal is to make sure that students' academic work is fairly recognized and that any disruption does not present a disadvantage to their future academic progress,\" Cauce said.\n\nMeanwhile, the US death toll from the coronavirus climbed to 14, with all but one victim in Washington state, while the number of infections rose to over 200, scattered across at least 18 states. Pennsylvania reported its first cases Friday.\n\nDonald Trump signed an $8.3bn measure to help tackle the outbreak. It provides federal public health agencies with money for tests and for potential vaccines and treatments and helps state and local governments prepare for the threat and respond to it.\n\nNine of the dead were from the same suburban Seattle nursing home, now under federal investigation. Families of nursing home residents voiced anger, having received conflicting information about the condition of their loved ones.\n\nOne woman was told her mother had died, then got a call from a staffer who said her mother was doing well, only to find out she had, in fact, died, said Kevin Connolly, whose father-in-law is also a facility resident.\n\n\"This is the level of incompetence we're dealing with,\" Connolly said in front of the Life Care Center in Kirkland.\n\nThe coronavirus has infected aboutd 100,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,400, the vast majority of them in China. Most cases have been mild, and more than half of those infected have recovered.\n\nSome major businesses in the Seattle area, where researchers say the virus may have circulated undetected for weeks, have shut down some operations or urged employees to work from home. That includes Microsoft and Amazon, the two tech giants that together employ more than 100,000 people in the region.\n\nKing county is buying a motel for $4m to house patients and hopes to have the first of them in place within days at the 84-room EconoLodge in Kent, about 20 miles (32 km) from Seattle. The rooms' doors open to the outside rather than to a central hallway, reducing the likelihood of contact between patients.\n\nThe plan was met with resistance from local leaders, including Kent's police chief, Rafael Padilla, who called it \"ill-advised and dangerous\" and warned: \"At any point a patient can simply walk into our community and spread the virus.\"\n\nElsewhere around the US, New York's mayor implored the federal government to send more test kits to his state, which on Thursday saw its caseload double overnight to 22, all of them in or near the city. Gap closed its New York office and asked employees to work from home until further notice after learning that an employee had the virus.\n\nIn Rhode Island, about 200 people were quarantined because of their connections to a school trip to Italy that has so far resulted in three cases. Amid four cases in Florida, the state's governor, Ron DeSantis, said the risks remain low for most people planning trips to the state for spring break or baseball's spring training.\n\nPassengers on a cruise ship off the California coast were instructed to stay in their cabins as they awaited test results Friday that could show whether the coronavirus is circulating among the more than 3,500 people aboard.\n\nA military helicopter crew lowered test kits onto the 951ft (290-meter) Grand Princess by rope and later retrieved them for analysis at a lab as the vessel lay at sea off San Francisco, under orders to keep its distance from shore. Princess Cruises said 45 people were selected for testing.\n\nAuthorities undertook the testing after a passenger on a previous voyage of the ship died of the coronavirus and at least four others became infected.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Mari_Cauce", "type":

"body": "The Trump administration's jettisoning of scientific expertise and the president's habit of spreading misinformation means the US is in a much weaker position to deal with the threat of coronavirus, experts have warned.\n\nThere are now at least 149 known coronavirus cases across 13 states, with 11 deaths. US lawmakers have put together an $8.3bn emergency bill to help contain the virus, with laboratories set to be allowed to develop their own coronavirus tests without seeking regulatory approval first.\n\nBut the efforts to address the outbreak risk being undermined by three years of a Trump administration that has seen an exodus of scientists from a variety of agencies, the scrapping and remodeling of scientific panels to favor industry interests and a president who regularly dismisses or distorts scientific facts - from the climate crisis to whether the moon is part of Mars - in public.\n\n\"The US is badly positioned; the federal government isn't up to the task,\" said Judith Enck, a former regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \"When I learned more about this virus my heart sank because I know the Trump administration doesn't value basic science, it doesn't understand it and it tends to reject it when it conflicts with its political narrative.\"\n\nEnck said that Trump \"doesn't seem to understand what a clinical trial is\", a reference to a White House meeting with pharmaceutical executives and public health officials on Monday where the president urged the attendees to release the anti-coronavirus drugs they are working on. \"So you have a medicine that's already involved with the coronaviruses, and now you have to see if it's specifically for this,\" Trump said. \"You can know that tomorrow, can't you?\"\n\nIn the meeting, Trump wondered aloud why the flu vaccine can't just be used for coronavirus. When told by Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, that it could be up to 18 months before a vaccine is available to the public, Trump responded: \"I mean, I like the sound of a couple months better, if I must be honest.\"\n\nAt a political rally in Charlotte later that day, Trump told the crowd that a vaccine will be available \"relatively soon\" before adding that there are \"fringe globalists that would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection - think of it - keep all of the infection, let it come in.\"\n\nTrump followed this with an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday in which he said the World Health Organization's figure of a 3.4% death rate from coronavirus is \"really a false number\" and that his \"hunch\" is that the level is \"way under 1%.\" He offered no evidence for his contradiction of the world's leading health body.\n\nThis sort of rhetoric, mixing inaccuracies, wild speculation and blunt nationalism, has raised concerns that many Americans, including ardent Trump supporters, are not getting the right information to deal with the virus outbreak.\n\n\"The scientific 'truth' about the virus may not match what the administration wants to hear, so the scientific 'truth' is at risk of being compromised before it is made public,\" said Wendy Wagner, a University of Texas expert in how policy-makers use science.\n\nWagner noted there are no requirements that a president provide accurate information about a public health issue, enabling Trump to freely misreport that a vaccine will shortly be available.\n\nThis situation is exacerbated by a downsizing of scientific expertise within the US government. The EPA's staff numbers, for example, are a third smaller than they were when Trump took power. In the first two years of the Trump administration, more than 1,600 federal scientists left various government agencies, according to Office of Personnel Management employment data.\n\nThe administration has attempted even deeper cuts: Trump's 2021 budget proposal, submitted just days after international alarm was raised over the coronavirus, included a 16% reduction in funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nTrump has said that the CDC and other agencies could rapidly restaff if needed but this concept runs counter to the standard practices of government-run research.\n\n\"Since Trump has been trying to shrink them, moreover, I worry that the agency directors are currently not well-positioned to act swiftly to expand the staff,\" Wagner said. \"The agencies may also fail to attract the best scientists going forward because of Trump's poor track record with the 'deep state' and science more generally.\"\n\nEnck said that previous disasters, such as hurricanes, have seen a \"seamless\" response from federal, state and local governments but the current situation may now require states, businesses and academia to fill the void where once the federal government provided leadership.\n\n\"There's definitely been a brain drain in this administration, there has been an attack on science that doesn't bode well for what we are seeing now,\" she said. \"Others are going to have to step up. The best thing the president could do right now is to stop talking.\"\n\nJoel Clement, a former policy director at the Department of Interior who left government after the Trump administration reassigned him from his climate-focused role, said the administration had undermined efforts to deal with threats such as pandemics.\n\nClement said Trump should bolster public trust in the civil servants dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, restore the scientific strength of the federal government and fund programs that will help prevent the spread of threats like the virus.\n\n\"In other words, he needs to do the opposite of what we know he will do,\" Clement said. \"He is more concerned about the safety of his fragile ego than he is about the safety of Americans.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_milman@theguardian.com", "name": "Oliver Milman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Lombardy, in the north of the country, in lockdown as it battles to contain the spread of the coronavirus. A draft decree would extend the quarantined areas, so-called \"red-zones\", telling people not to enter or leave the region.\n\nThe country is grappling to contain Europe's worst outbreak of Covid-19, which has claimed 233 lives and infected a total of 5,883 people.\n\nItalian authorities announced that a new decree containing draconian measures would be approved later on Saturday. The decree will include imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving the region of Lombardy, the worst-affected region, until 3 April.

"The health secretary Matt Hancock has suggested that in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus, people should wash their hands while singing Happy Birthday - twice, though - in order to ensure the operation lasts the recommended 20 seconds. As a tune like Happy Birthday gets old fast, especially when it isn't anyone's birthday, are there any other songs that might fit the bill? Of course there are.\n\nOoh Ahh... Just a Little Bit - Gina G\n\nBritain's 1996 Eurovision entry only came eigth, but that's probably because there wasn't a worldwide pandemic on at the time. The chorus is almost exactly 20 seconds long and the lyrics are, if anything, less challenging than Happy Birthday. They are also vaguely encouraging, reminding you, just when you think you're done, to wash your hands that little bit more.\n\nTake on Me - A-ha\n\nThe chorus of this one is also 20 seconds once through, provided you can hold the last note and resist the urge to rush it along. The high notes might be a problem for some, so start on the lowest note available to you.\n\nJolene - Dolly Parton\n\nThis, which comes from a song list supplied by journalist Jen Monnier on Twitter, has another 20-second chorus. It is also only 25 words long, and eight of them are Jolene.\n\nHappy Birthday to You (You Live in a Zoo version)\n\nYou know what never gets old? This classic parody of the traditional celebratory singalong. Also recommended are Jingle Bells (Batman Smells version), This Land Is My Land (It Is Not Your Land version).\n\n4'33\" - John Cage\n\nObviously you will only need the first 20 seconds of this silent orchestral piece, but it is ideal if you have a terrible singing voice. Just use a timer, like the conductor.\n\nAny Dream Will Do - Andrew Lloyd Webber & Tim Rice\n\nThe standout song from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat should get you at least 15 seconds into your ablutions before you forget what comes next, unless you are a diehard fan, in which case you will have very clean fingernails. You can also adjust the words to narrate the whole operation (\"I wash my hands / For 15 seconds / Not enough they reckon / It will have to do\"), making it a bit more instructive.\n\nStayin' Alive - Bee Gees\n\nAs has been pointed out on Twitter, the chorus of Stayin' Alive is a generous, health-and-safety conscious 24 seconds, but it is also recommended as the song you are meant to do CPR to in order to maintain the correct pace. In the coming months, we may well be doing a lot of both handwashing and CPR, so it is probably safer to have one song for everything.\n\nSigns - the Five Man Electrical Band\n\nThe first verse of the 1971 hit single by the Canadian rockers, the one that begins: \"And the sign said: 'Long-haired Freaky People Need Not Apply ...'\" - will take you about 20 seconds to warble through. If you don't know it already, learn it. You will wake up every morning absolutely gagging to wash your hands.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Polly Toynbee", "body": "If there's an epidemic on the scale Public Health England warns of, the government may not be able to keep its citizens safe\n\nBlame Boris Johnson for almost everything, but not for the arrival of the coronavirus. He puts on his serious face, slightly unrumples his hair and tells people to wash their hands. As no one voted for him for public health advice he would do well to let untrusted politicians opine as little as possible, leaving public announcements to the respected chief scientific officer and chief medical officer.\n\nBut there is no way of keeping politics out of this. If this epidemic is only half as bad as the official worst-case scenario, the pressure on every aspect of public services will be tested to breaking point. The full effect of a decade of austerity is about to be brutally exposed.\n\nUntil now, the Tories have won and won again, despite the deepest austerity - confident that most people, most of the time, know nothing of cuts in public services they aren't using now or can't see. Though the A&E crisis is never off our TV screens, the remainder stays below most voters' radar. But this virus may expose the true state of the country for all to see.\n\nTim Cook, an ICU doctor, writing in the Guardian, gave a graphic picture of the lack of intensive care and critical care beds - Britain ranking 23rd out of 31 countries for provision, and almost bottom for the number of hospital beds overall. But what of every other service?\n\nLocal authorities have the lead role in public health emergencies: they do disaster rehearsals for imaginary terror or biohazard attacks, coordinating with the army for emergency tents and temporary morgues, says Tony Travers, professor of government at the LSE. But coronavirus would probably be a crisis in every council simultaneously, with each being unable to call on help from the others. Over the past decade councils have lost between a third and a half of their income, with a quarter of their staff gone and up to a half lost in some places. Already the flooding has left those local authorities warning they haven't the money to cope.\n\nCouncils' incapacity was exposed, Travers says, over the Grenfell tragedy. Kensington and Chelsea was not exceptionally badly run, but it could not cope with rehousing and supporting its residents after the tower block calamity: a team of chief executives from other local authorities had to come in and take over. The council on its own had lost too much administrative capacity. Councils run most services, and most, such as environmental health, have been hugely depleted: the National Audit Office describes that service as \"failing\".\n\nThat civic incapacity will be revealed time and again by a coronavirus outbreak, with Whitehall's civil service reduced to its smallest size in decades: look at the panic-hiring just announced to manage the Brexit customs fallout. If, as government plans suggest, one in five staff are out of action, the care sector will be hit hardest and fastest, as it is already so fragile and understaffed. That puts at risk the lives of old people at home alone or in care homes unable to care, with day centres mostly closed down in the cuts.\n\nMoney will need to flow fast to stop some care homes going bust and to hire emergency staff from agencies, no doubt at higher rates. Children's homes face the same crisis, with many more children in care than a decade ago: social work departments are already overstretched. As for understaffed prisons, the prospect of virus outbreaks there and many staff off sick is frightening.\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care said yesterday, somewhat over-reassuringly: \"The UK is extremely well prepared for these types of outbreaks and Public Health England has issued tailored guidance for care providers setting out action to be taken in a variety of circumstances.\"\n\nPublic Health England does indeed inspire trust in its advice and oversight, but boots on the ground and helping hands are provided locally, and councils have taken the heaviest hit in the great austerity. Ever since George Osborne's first budget in 2010, the plan was to \"devolve the axe\" to them. The Local Government Association this week warns they have lost \u00a315bn.\n\nThe public realm will be exposed: the number of people working in it has fallen to just 16.5% of all jobs, the lowest since 1945. We will feel the spending cuts, with only \u00a386 spent now on public services for every \u00a3100 spent in 2010.\n\nThe government is trying to recruit the 20,000 police it cut, but this takes time. Call in the army, says the emergency plan, but it's now at its smallest ever, down to 73,000 from 103,000 in 2003. Even if there are no food panics requiring police or army at supermarket checkouts for rationing, emergency services are already planning to triage what they can provide with tough restrictions on their services.\n\nIn our book, The Lost Decade 2010-2020, David Walker and I have chronicled this unprecedented decline. The Tories have escaped electoral censure for austerity - so far. Perhaps, with luck, the virus will pass over without putting the country to the test. But if it is an epidemic on the scale Public Health England warns of, the politicians who have left the country so defenceless can expect trouble. Voters will be shocked to discover how far the things they took for granted have been depleted; and that the government may no longer be able to keep its citizens safe.\n\n* The Lost Decade 2010-2020 and What Lies Ahead for Britain, by Polly Toynbee and David Walker, is published this week by Faber, \u00a310.99 rrp.

"You're washing your hands 10 times a day and have stopped touching your face. What else can you do to improve your health and avoid bugs?\n\nIt's been a long, wet winter. Everybody has got colds, and now we are braced for a coronavirus epidemic. Boosting our immune system has rarely felt more urgent, but, beyond eating more tangerines and hoping for the best, what else can we do?\n\nSheena Cruickshank, a professor of immunology at the University of Manchester, has a \"shocking cold\" when we speak at a safe distance, over the phone. To know how to take care of your immune system, she says, first you need to understand the weapons in your armoury - a cheeringly impressive collection, it turns out.\n\n\"When you come into contact with a germ you've never met before,\" she says, \"you've got various barriers to try to stop it getting into your body.\" As well as skin, we have mucus - \"snot is a really important barrier\" - and a microbiome, the collective noun for the estimated 100tn microbes that live throughout our bodies, internally and externally. Some of these helpful bugs make antimicrobial chemicals and compete with pathogens for food and space.\n\nBeneath these writhing swamps of mucus and microbes, our bodies are lined with epithelial cells which, says Cruickshank, \"are really hard to get through. They make antimicrobial products including, most relevant to coronavirus, antiviral compounds that are quite hostile.\"\n\nIf a pathogen breaches these defences, it has to deal with our white blood cells, or immune cells. One type, called macrophages, inhabit all our body tissue and, says Cruickshank, \"have all these weapons ready to go, but they're not terribly precise\". They report to the cleverer, adaptive white blood cells known as lymphocytes. They are the ones that remember germs, \"so if you meet that germ again,\" says Cruickshank, \"they'll just deal with it probably without you even knowing. That's when you've got immunity and is the basis of vaccination. It's trying to bypass all the early stuff and create the memory, so you don't have to be sick.\"\n\nOur immune systems may have blind spots. \"This might mean that our immune response doesn't recognise certain bugs,\" she says, \"or the bugs have sneaky evasion strategies. Personally, my immune system is not necessarily very good at seeing colds.\" But a healthy lifestyle will ensure your defences are as good as they get.\n\nSeeing as our bodies contain more cells belonging to microbes, such as bacteria and yeasts, than human ones, let's start with the microbiome. \"We live in a symbiotic relationship with our gut bacteria,\" says Prof Arne Akbar, the president of the British Society for Immunology and a professor at University College, London. \"Having the right ones around, that we evolved with, is best for our health. Anything we do that alters that can be detrimental.\"\n\nNot only do our microbes form protective barriers, they also programme our immune systems. Animals bred with no microbiome have less well developed immune responses. Older people, and those with diseases that are characterised by inflammation, such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, tend to have less varied gut microbiomes.\n\nTo feed your gut flora, Cruickshank recommends \"eating a more varied diet with lots of high-fibre foods\". Being vegetarian isn't a prerequisite for microbiome health, but the more plant foods you consume, the better. \"The microbiome really likes fibre, pulses and fermented foods,\" she adds.\n\nKefir yoghurt and pickles such as sauerkraut and kimchi are among the fermented delicacies now fashionable thanks to our increasing knowledge of the microbiome. But the evidence for taking probiotic supplements, she says, \"is mixed\". It's not a dead cert that they will survive the journey through your digestive tract, or that they will hang around long enough if they do. \"It's more effective to change your diet,\" says Cruickshank.\n\nThe skin microbiome is important, too, but we know less about it. High doses of ultraviolet light (usually from the sun) can affect it negatively, weakening any protective functions (as well as triggering immune suppression in the skin itself). Overwashing with strong soaps and using antibacterial products is not friendly to our skin microbiomes. \"Combinations of perfumes and moisturisers might well also have an effect,\" says Cruickshank.\n\nTo be immunologically fit, you need to be physically fit. \"White blood cells can be quite sedentary,\" says Akbar. \"Exercise mobilises them by increasing your blood flow, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy in other parts of the body.\" The NHS says adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity (hiking, gardening, cycling) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (running, swimming fast, an aerobics class).\n\nThe advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. \"Anything's better than nothing,\" says Akbar. But a lifetime's exercise could significantly slow your immune system declining with age. In 2018, a study by University of Birmingham and King's College London found that 125 non-smoking amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79 still had the immune systems of young people.\n\nThe other side of the coin, says Akbar, \"is elite athletes who become very susceptible to infections because you can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system.\" This problem is unlikely to affect most of us unless, says Cruickshank, \"you're a couch potato and suddenly try and run a marathon, this could introduce stress hormones and be quite bad for your immune system\".\n\nOne of the many happy side-effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities. Stress hormones such as cortisol can compromise immune function, a common example of which, says Akbar, is when chickenpox strikes twice. If you have had it, the virus never completely goes away. \"During periods of stress,\" he says, \"it can reactivate again and we get shingles.\"\n\nForget boozing through the coronavirus crisis, because heavy drinking also depletes our immune cells. \"Some studies have suggested that the first-line-of-defence macrophages are not as effective in people who have had a lot of alcohol,\" says Cruickshank. \"And there's been suggestions that high alcohol consumption can lead to a reduction of the lymphocytes as well. So if the bug gets into you, you're not going to be as good at containing and fighting it off.\"\n\nCruickshank says that vitamin D has become a hot topic in immunology. \"It is used by our macrophages, and is something that people in Britain can get quite low on in the winter.\" Necking extra vitamin C, however, is probably a waste of time for well-fed westerners. It's not that vitamin C isn't crucial to immune function (and other things, such as bone structure). \"All the vitamins are important,\" says Cruickshank, \"but vitamin C is water soluble, it's not one that your body stores.\" Eating your five a day of fruits and vegetables is the best way to maintain necessary levels.\n\nExercising and eating well will have the likely knock-on effect of helping you sleep better, which is a bonus because a tired body is more susceptible to bugs. One study last year found that lack of sleep impaired the disease-fighting ability of a type of lymphocyte called T cells, and research is demonstrating the importance of our natural biorhythms overall.\n\nJanet Lord, a professor at the University of Birmingham, recently showed that vaccinating people in the morning is more effective than doing so in the afternoon. \"Your natural biorhythms are, to some extent, dictated by sleep,\" says Akbar. \"If you've got a regular sleep pattern, you have natural body rhythms and everything's fine. If they go out of kilter, then you've got problems.\"\n\nThe seriousness of an infection largely depends on the dose you are hit with, which could in turn depend on how contagious the carrier is when they cough near you. \"We're constantly exposed to germs, and we only get sick from a handful of those,\" says Cruickshank.\n\nIf you're reasonably young and healthy, says Akbar, the mild benefits you may achieve from being extra good probably won't fend off a severe dose of coronavirus or flu. The likely scenario if you catch the infection is, he says, \"you'll be sick for a while and you will recover\".\n\nFrom a public-health perspective, when nasty viruses such as coronavirus are doing the rounds, Akbar's priority is not boosting already healthy people's immune systems, \"but protecting the vulnerable people. Older people don't respond that well to the flu jab, though it's better for them to have it than not. It's a general problem of immune decline with ageing.\"\n\nWhen we get older, he says, the barrier function in the gut doesn't work that well, \"so you have something called leaky gut syndrome, where bugs creep into our bodies causing mild infections\". This causes inflammation around the body, as does the natural accumulation of old \"zombie\" cells, called senescent cells, and inflammation compromises the immune response.\n\nAkbar is working on developing drug treatments to reduce inflammation in older people but they are a way off yet. Age 65 is when, medically, one is considered older, \"but that's arbitrary\", says Akbar. \"Some old people might get problems much earlier. And there are older people who are totally healthy.\"\n\n\"In terms of coronavirus,\" says Cruickshank, \"it's mostly spread by droplet transmission, as far as we can tell, so the biggest thing is hygiene.\" So wash your hands, and sneeze and cough into tissues, she suggests, between sniffles. No one can completely avoid getting sick, not even top immunologists.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The government confirmed contingency plans on Tuesday to call back to work NHS \"leavers and retirees\" to help relieve pressure on an NHS workforce that is expected to be overwhelmed by the virus.\n\nBut a majority of 120 former NHS employees who responded to a Guardian callout were resistant, and in some cases hostile, to the idea. Many respondents said unprompted they did not want to a return to a working environment where they suffered stress, bullying, burnout and even breakdowns.\n\nSeventy-one said they would not be happy to return to work, with many expressing their reluctance in vehement terms. \"After the way I was treated I would rather shove a rusty six-inch nail up my backside than return to my old job,\" said a 67-year-old former staff nurse from Manchester.\n\nAnthony O'Neill, 58, from Glasgow, said: \"No, nein, non, nej! Was a hospital physician for 32 years: never ever going back.\" And a 60-year-old London GP said: \"I left general practice due to burnout. I would not go back under any circumstances.\"\n\nA 58-year-old former GP from Northamptonshire said he \"jumped ship early\" after \"being repeatedly shafted by successive administrations\". He asked: \"Why would I go back?\"\n\nA former senior sister from Wigan said she still has \"nightmares 12 years on about the extraordinary working conditions\". Another said: \"I left nursing in disgust at the treatment of nursing and ancillary staff by a toxic and bullying management culture.\" And a nurse from Cheshire said: \"I still feel quite angry that I felt no option but to retire at 55.\"\n\nMany expressed concern that returning to work would put them at risk of contracting the disease and that their lack of recent practice could put patients at risk.\n\nA 69-year-old former GP from North Yorkshire said he would fear for his life. \"It would place me in a position where I would receive a high lethal dose of the virus.\" Another former clinician, with a long-term chronic condition, said it would be \"suicide\" for her to return to frontline duties.\n\nRick Allen, 60, a retired GP from Kent, said: \"GPs will be decimated by the illness as will those who come to replace them. Getting doctors back from retirement is just a government PR exercise to look as if they're taking serious action. I'd sooner stay at home, batten down the hatches and look after my own family.\"\n\nMorag Bell, 67, a retired nurse from Stockton-on-Tees, said: \"Surely asking older and more susceptible ex-professionals to assist is counterintuitive.\"\n\nSome felt guilty for expressing reluctance to return. One 56-year-old former GP from Devon said: \"I was seriously burnt out when I retired and am only just getting to the point where I feel human again. I live in the community where I was a GP. Saying 'no' to going back to work would feel difficult and selfish, especially if people in my community were suffering and my former colleagues were overwhelmed by demand but it is not something I want to do.\"\n\nA small minority were keen to return with 16 of the 120 saying they would do so without reservations. They included a 79-year-old doctor from Solihull who said: \"To help out the country in need would be a unique privilege as a humanitarian and humble service.\" Another of those to say they were keen to return to work was a former paediatrician from Bath who previously volunteered to tackle the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.\n\nBut most of those who said they would be willing to go back had reservations. Asked if they were willing to return to work, 33 of those who responded provided \"yes, but\" answers. They included one who would say she would return to work but not at the hospital that offered her \"no support following my breakdown\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

The NHS isn't ready for the coronavirus crisis | Tim Cook", "body": "As the virus spreads, hospitals need to step up plans to care for the very sick, recruit more staff and cancel routine surgery\n\n* Tim Cook is a doctor in an NHS intensive care unit\n\nCoronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, have dominated the headlines. Yet the range of expectations and predictions of its impacts have been so wide as to make clear understanding almost impossible. This is perhaps inevitable when we grapple with a fast-moving and previously unknown illness. What is clear, is that as knowledge grows it has become evident that this has the potential to be one of the most fatal epidemics to have hit the world for a century, and it is rapidly increasing in prevalence in the UK.\n\nI work as a doctor in an intensive care unit (ICU). It is a speciality (like anaesthesia its parent speciality) which most of the public have little understanding of unless they have required our services. What is in no doubt is that ICU sits at the centre of all that is necessary for keeping alive what may be a very large number of patients who will develop severe Covid-19.\n\nICU treats patients whose lives are at risk or whose organs have failed. Severe Covid-19 leads mostly to lung failure but also causes kidney and cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) failure. All these are rapidly fatal without intense and prompt treatments only available in ICU. In simple terms, treatments include a ventilator taking over the patient's breathing while the patient is anaesthetised (placed in an induced coma), a dialysis machine cleaning the blood and drugs or machines supporting the heart and blood pressure. The reality of care is, of course, considerably more complex and highly intensive.\n\nSo let's look at some statistics: it is likely that more than 30% of the whole UK population will get Covid-19 - it may be as high as 60% in some estimates. Most will have no or mild illness but maybe one in seven will need hospital admission. Of patients in hospital up to one in five may need ICU care - that would be an unprecedented number of people admitted to ICU. As many as one in 50 of patients known to have Covid-19 may die from it.\n\nICU is a precious and scarce resource in terms of beds, staff and equipment. This is especially so in the UK. In 2012 the UK had about 4,100 critical care beds including ICU beds and \"high dependency\" beds which are a step down from full ICU care. Compared with other European countries the UK ranked 23rd of 31 in terms of ICU beds per head of population and 29th of 31 for all hospital beds. Germany has approximately four times as many ICU beds per capita as the UK and the USA perhaps 10-fold as many. Data from 2017 suggest little change. Most UK ICUs therefore run at or above 90% occupancy and often can only admit new patients only by discharging others - even when workload is normal. Covid-19 will increase pressures not only because of weight of numbers but because intermediate treatments for pneumonia and lung failure are \"aerosol-generating\" (ie they risk spreading the disease) so cannot be used and early recourse to ICU is required.\n\nIncreased ICU demands equate to each ICU bed being needed for approximately 100 more patients than on average in the epidemic period - at least 10 times the normal throughput and equivalent to needing at least another 10 ICUs in the hospital during the epidemic. Of course, this demand will be in addition to, rather than instead of, normal workload as the illnesses that usually require ICU admission will not go away during the epidemic. In Wuhan, ICU capacity was increased by over 1,000 beds in two weeks by building a new hospital, but this is not possible in the UK.\n\nManaging an ICU patient with Covid-19 is more complex than normal ICU care. Patients must be individually isolated. All staff must wear \"personal protective equipment\" (PPE), which consists of, as a minimum, a tight-fitting face mask, an extra gown, gloves, goggles and visor. PPE must be put on and taken off before and after patient contact and checked by a \"buddy\" colleague. Despite this scrupulous process in China two in every five early infections were acquired in hospital and two-thirds of these were healthcare workers, a significant number of whom then died. These demands slow down care, increase the number of staff needed and expose staff (and perhaps their families) to significant risk.\n\nPatients in ICU have constant one-to-one nursing. Medical interventions are frequent, invasive and performed at extremely close proximity. Contact with body fluids is inevitable and common. But it is not only nurses and doctors who are at risk. Hospital cleaners will be required to be on hand at all times and rigorous cleaning is required between patients and after many procedures. Physiotherapists, dietitians, laboratory technicians and other medical specialists involved in care are also at risk. Keeping staff safe has implications beyond their welfare: skilled staff are a limited resource and if sickness rates are even moderate there will be major gaps in service.\n\nThe challenge from Covid-19 to ICU services in the UK is enormous and pressing. Throughout the UK, ICUs are preparing exceptional plans and training all staff to manage these patients with skill and safety, for the patient and themselves. Hospitals are acting to expand ICU care outside its existing footprint and double or even treble ICU capacity, most likely by taking over operating theatres. This expansion will involve engaging anaesthetists and others to provide ICU medical care and nurses from elsewhere in the hospital to work as ICU staff. To facilitate this, much or all routine surgery will need to stop. Many patients with Covid-19 will also be hospitalised outside ICU and care of these patients and those in ICU will have major consequences for caring for other patients who do not have Covid-19.\n\nWhether these extreme precautions will be needed is unknown. If they are, whether even these measures will be sufficient is also unknown. We will find out over the next few weeks and months. In the meantime, preparations need to be accelerated and coordinated and we need to be honest and transparent about the potential impact of a Wuhan-type epidemic here in the UK, which no doubt will pose a major challenge to everyone working in the NHS.\n\n* Tim Cook is a doctor in an NHS intensive care unit", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

"Italy has been plunged into chaos after details of a plan to quarantine more than 16 million people in the north amid an escalating coronavirus outbreak were leaked to the press, sending thousands into panic as they tried to flee south.\n\nThe whole of Lombardy, including its financial capital of Milan, and 14 provinces across the worst-affected northern regions, have been shut down until 3 April as Italy grapples to contain the spread of a virus that has so far killed 233 people and infected 5,883.\n\nThousands crowded train stations in Lombardy or jumped into their cars after details of a draft decree banning people from leaving or entering the region were revealed by Corriere della Sera late on Saturday afternoon.\n\nOn Sunday morning dozens of police officers and medics wearing masks and hazmat suits waited in Salerno, in Campania, for passengers who had boarded overnight trains from Lombardy. The passengers will be registered and obliged to self-quarantine as fears mount over the virus's spread in the south.\n\n\"What happened with the news leak has caused many people to try to escape, causing the opposite effect of what the decree is trying to achieve,\" said Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan. \"Unfortunately some of those who fled will be infected with the disease.\"\n\nThe northern regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto account for 85% of all the 5,883 confirmed cases to date and 92% of the 233 recorded deaths. Puglia in the south has had 26 cases, while the provinces of Basilicata and Calabria have had just three and four cases.\n\nMichele Emiliano, the president of Puglia, signed an order on Sunday obliging all those arriving from the north in the coming hours to go into quarantine.\n\n\"Get off at the first train station, don't take planes to Bari and Brindisi, go back by car, get off the bus at the next stop,'' he wrote on Facebook, mostly addressing people from the region who live in the north. \"Do not bring the Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia epidemic to your Puglia. You are carrying the virus into the lungs of your brothers and sisters, your grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents.\"\n\nHowever, the impact of the decree on flights and trains to and from the north are not yet clear. Under the new guidelines, local judicial authorities can decide whether to suspend flights. As of Sunday afternoon, it was still possible to travel by train and plane to Lombardy but, in the next few hours, there will be checkpoints at motorways, train stations and airports.\n\n\"The fact that the epidemic is still increasing substantially obliges us to take these measures to limit the freedom of people, which of course are very extreme measures that I don't think have ever been taken in any other democratic country,\" Walter Ricciardi, an adviser to the Italian health ministry on the coronavirus outbreak and member of the World Health Organization, told the Guardian.\n\n\"We have to be responsible and being responsible means taking measures in the interest of people, even if sometimes it is hard to understand.\"\n\nThe leak of the decree sparked harsh criticism from officials. Ricciardi, who was among the team of scientists who signed it, said that he assumed it must have leaked when the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, sent the draft to the regions to get their consent. \"It means that sometimes both people from the institutions and people from the press do not feel a sense of responsibility. This is very unfortunate because these kinds of procedures have to be taken very confidentially in order not to provoke panic among the people and inappropriate behaviours.\"\n\nThe decree, approved by all political parties, was signed by Conte late on Saturday and approved by the council of ministers on Sunday. Conte said the news leak was \"unacceptable\". \"This news created uncertainty, insecurity and confusion, and we cannot tolerate this,\" he said during a press conference in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nUnder the decree, police and armed forces will patrol Lombardy's access points, such as train stations and motorway entrances and exits, as well as border areas of the 14 provinces under lockdown across Emilia-Romagna, the second-worst outbreak zone, Veneto and Piedmont. The provinces include Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, Vercelli, Padua, Treviso and Venice.\n\nPeople will only be able to leave the areas for emergency reasons and face fines and up to three months in jail for breaking the quarantine rules.\n\nAn elderly couple from Codogno, a town in Lombardy, where the outbreak first emerged, could face penalties after leaving the town to go on holiday in Trentino Alto Adige. The couple subsequently fell ill and tested positive for the virus after going to the emergency unit of a hospital in Trento.\n\nSchools and universities were already closed across Italy, while cinemas, museums, theatres, gyms, swimming pools and ski resorts will now be closed in the new quarantine zones and all public events, including sporting events, banned.\n\nBars and restaurants can only open between 6am and 6pm, while shops must guarantee that customers stand at least one metre apart. Weddings and funerals have also been banned in the areas affected. It is unclear how the measures will affect commercial trade in the regions. Public transport services within all territories under lockdown are expected to continue.\n\nAs coronavirus takes hold of the country, Beppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, called for a \"change of lifestyle\". \"We need to avoid contacts that are not strictly necessary,\" he said in a video on Facebook. \"Please, remain in your homes as much as you can.\"\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak is wreaking havoc on Italy's already fragile economy, especially as the northern regions produce the largest share of the country's GDP. The government on Thursday approved a \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36.5bn) package of financial measures to help the economy withstand the impact.\n\n\"We are facing an emergency but locking down a quarter of the country will cause immeasurable damage to Italian families,\" added Sala. \"People risk losing their jobs. I expect the government to move quickly to make the funds available. Like it or not, Milan is the heart of this country.\"\n\nOther major cities, including Rome, have also emptied out, but in many places beyond the outbreak zones people are mostly going about their daily lives.\n\nBurioni said lifestyle sacrifices needed to be made to halt the spread of the virus. \"The most important thing at this time is that each and every one of us stay home,\" he added. \"As much as possible we need to avoid social contact that is not strictly necessary. We all have the responsibility to do what is necessary to prevent the spread. We've seen rigorous behaviour in China that has had a very good impact - we need to do the same.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

in toilet paper shortage", "body": "NT News, known for its humorous front pages, produces a special edition amid panic over loo roll shortage\n\nIt's the panic that keeps on giving.\n\n#ToiletPaperEmergency or the great #ToiletPaperApocalypse, as it has been dubbed on Twitter, has already rolled out hundreds of memes, witty asides as well as documented the madness of people stockpiling the toilet essential.\n\nIn the real world it has led to Australian toilet paper manufacturers ramping up production to keep up with demand from people fearful of coronavirus.\n\nOne newspaper has gone one step further by printing extra pages in its editions to help out those who have been ... caught short.\n\nOn Thursday the NT News, the Darwin-based newspaper with a national reputation for its headlines and antics, printed a special eight-page insert that can be cut into toilet paper.\n\nIts editor, Matt Williams, told Guardian Australia the paper was selling well and was \"certainly not a crappy edition\".\n\n\"We are a newspaper known around the world who understands the needs of our readers,\" he said. \"Territorians ... are in great need of toilet paper right now so we had to deliver what they needed.\"\n\nThe stunt comes after supermarkets including Coles and Woolworths have been besieged by shoppers clearing their shelves of loo paper and hand sanitiser.\n\nEven at Millicent in South Australia, the town that mills most of Australia's toilet paper supplies, local shops have had to order in extra stock, the ABC has reported.\n\nThe Kimberley-Clark mill has increased its production to 24 hours a day in response to supermarket shortages, in an attempt to get supply back on to shelves.\n\nThe ethical subscription toilet paper service Who Gives a Crap said it had sold out of all products.\n\nAnd he managing director of Australian Bidet, Randall Cadby, said the business had been inundated with calls, emails and website traffic.\n\nAttempts to stockpile toilet paper began this week amid panic buying of long-life food other staples.\n\nIt remains unclear why people have begun hoarding vast quantities of the product, given that there has been no indication stocks might run low and there is not likely to be increased an need for toilet paper in the event the coronavirus spreads to a significant extent.\n\nThe Twitter hashtag #ToiletPaperEmergency - featuring images of people attempting to stockpile massive quantities of paper, empty supermarket shelves and those trying to profit from reselling rolls - has become the top trend in Australia.\n\nOn Thursday Australia's largest supermarket announced it would implement a four-pack limit for customers.\n\nOn Thursday morning a truck carrying supplies of toilet paper caught fire on the Gateway Bridge, near Brisbane. About half the rolls were saved.\n\n\"This is not overly common, particularly around the city areas, but the main thing is no one got hurt tonight and we've been able to save quite a lot of toilet paper,\" a fire officer, Justin Francis, told the ABC.\n\n\"There was quite an interesting fuel load on this particular vehicle as we believe toilet paper is quite precious at the moment, so we've been able to save half the load on this particular truck,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

attacks Obama administration 'decision' amid slow rollout of testing for virus\n\nDonald Trump sought to shift blame on to the Obama administration for a nationwide coronavirus test kit shortage.\n\nThe president on Wednesday blamed a federal agency decision during Barack Obama's presidency, which Trump said made it harder to quickly roll out testing for the virus.\n\n\"The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion,\" he told reporters during a White House meeting with airline executives, whom he had called to discuss the economic effects of the outbreak.\n\n\"That was a decision we disagreed with,\" he said. \"I don't think we would have made it, but for some reason, it was made.\"\n\nIt was unclear what decision Trump was referring to. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said private laboratories used to be able to develop clinical tests but \"in the previous administration that became regulated. For someone to do that they had to file with the FDA\", Redfield said.\n\nBut experts on lab testing have said they are unaware of an Obama administration rule that would have hindered the use of tests developed at university or private labs in an emergency.\n\nThe responsibility for the coronavirus test kit shortage appears to lie with the CDC's choice to develop and distribute its own kit rather than use the one recommended by the World Health Organization, according to ProPublica. But the CDC's tests didn't work, falsely flagging harmless samples that contained viruses other than Covid-19.\n\nMoreover, Trump ordered the dissolution of the National Security Council's global health security unit and reassigned its head. The former national security adviser John Bolton also pressured the team's counterpart at the Department of Homeland Security to resign.\n\nTrump attacked Democrats for warning of the seriousness of the crisis while spreading disinformation and downplaying the outbreak, his critics have said.\n\nTwo days before he was announced as a member of the White House taskforce on coronavirus, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, declared coronavirus \"contained\" in the US, despite a plethora of data that suggested it was not.\n\n\"I won't say airtight, but it's pretty close to airtight,\" Kudlow told CNBC, swaddling himself in a comforting narrative that was probably destroyed in his first meeting with the task force.\n\nLast week, a senior health department official alleged that she was retaliated against after raising concerns that staff had been sent to assist Americans evacuated from China because of coronavirus without proper training or appropriate protective gear.\n\n\"If efforts are being made to muzzle them, to control messaging so that it suits the political needs of the administration,\" Michael Carome of Public Citizen, a not-for-profit consumer advocacy organization, said, \"that's ultimately going to endanger the public.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [],

"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/05/theres-something-out-there-spread-of-disease", "title": "Fever dreams: did author Dean Koontz really predict coronavirus?", "body": "From 'Wuhan-400', the deadly virus invented by Dean Koontz in 1981, to the plague unleashed in Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake, novelists have long been fascinated by pandemics\n\nAccording to an online conspiracy theory, the American author Dean Koontz predicted the coronavirus outbreak in 1981. His novel The Eyes of Darkness made reference to a killer virus called \"Wuhan-400\" - eerily predicting the Chinese city where Covid-19 would emerge. But the similarities end there: Wuhan-400 is described as having a \"kill\u2011rate\" of 100%, developed in labs outside the city as the \"perfect\" biological weapon. An account with more similarities, also credited by some as predicting coronavirus, is found in the 2011 film Contagion, about a global pandemic that jumps from animals to humans and spreads arbitrarily around the globe.\n\nBut when it comes to our suffering, we want something more than arbitrariness. We want it to mean something. This is evident in our stories about illness and disease, from contemporary science fiction all the way back to Homer's Iliad. Even malign actors are more reassuring than blind happenstance. Angry gods are better than no gods at all.\n\nIn Homer's Iliad, the Greeks disrespect one of Apollo's priests. The god manifests his displeasure by firing his arrows of contagion into their camp. The plague lasts nine days, brief by modern epidemiological standards. When the Greeks make amends and sacrifice sheep and goats to Apollo, the plague is cured.\n\nSeven centuries later a plague struck Periclean Athens, killing a quarter of the city's population and setting the city-state on a path to military defeat at the hands of Sparta. Thucydides, the Athenian historian, has a simple explanation for the epidemic: Apollo. The Spartans had cannily supplicated the god and he in return had promised victory. Soon afterwards, Sparta's enemies started dying of the plague. Hindsight suggests that Athens, under siege - its population swollen with refugees, everyone living in unsanitary conditions - was at risk of contagion in a way the Spartan army, free to roam the countryside outside, clearly wasn't. But this thought doesn't occur to Thucydides. It can only be the god.\n\nBetween then and now there have been prodigious advances in medical science. We understand contagious disease vastly better, and have a greater arsenal of medicine and hygiene to fight it. But in one respect we haven't advanced at all. We still tend to see agency in our pandemics.\n\nDisease has no agency. Bacteria and viruses spread blindly where they can, their pathways facilitated by our globalised world. We, meanwhile, bring to the struggle our ever-improving drugs and hygiene. With Covid-19, experts insist, your two best bets are: wash your hands often, touch your face never. But people do not warm to the existential arbitrariness of this. Just as the Peloponnesian plague was seen as evidence that the gods were angry with Athens, so HIV was seen by a deluded minority as God's judgment on homosexuals. Of course, HIV spreads wherever it can and cares nothing for your morals or sexual orientation.\n\nThis attribution of agency is clearest in the many imaginary plagues science-fiction writers have inflicted on humanity. In place of gods we have aliens, like those in Alice Sheldon's chilling and brilliant short story \"The Screwfly Solution\" (1977). A new disease provokes men to begin murdering women en masse. At the story's end we discover an alien species had introduced a brain infection so that the human race will destroy itself and the aliens can inherit the emptied planet. It's a story about what we now call \"toxic masculinity\" and it says: it's not gods we have angered, but goddesses.\n\nSometimes the alien plague is less picky. In HP Lovecraft's The Colour Out of Space (1927; recently filmed, starring Nicolas Cage) an alien infection arrives via meteorite, wastes the land and drives people mad. In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain (1969) potentially world-ending contagion falls from outer space. This bug repeatedly mutates as Earth's scientists try to combat it. We're doomed - or would be, if it weren't for the tale's germus ex machina ending, in which the alien spontaneously mutates into a benign form.\n\nIf it's not aliens behind our world-threatening plague, then it is probably that other SF stalwart, the mad scientist. Dozens of zombie franchises start with a rogue scientist infecting the population with a genetically engineered bioweapon virus. In Frank Herbert's The White Plague (1982) a geneticist, pushed into insanity by the murder of his family, creates a pathogen that kills all humanity's females. A cure is eventually found, but not before the world's population balance has been shifted to leave thousands of men to every woman.\n\nIn Joanna Russ's feminist masterpiece The Female Man (1975), \"Whileaway\", a gender-specific virus has wiped out all the men, creating an effective utopia for women left behind, procreating by parthenogenesis and living in harmony. By the novel's end it is hinted that the man-destroying plague was actually engineered by a female scientist. Never mind the antibacterial handwash: it is patriarchy that we need to scrub out.\n\nSo characteristic is assigning agency to pandemics in today's culture that a video game such as Plague Inc (Ndemic Creations 2012) styles its players not as doctors attempting to stop the spread of a pandemic, but as the sickness itself. The player's mission is to help their plagues spread and exterminate the human race. In HG Wells's seminal War of the Worlds (1898) and in its various modern retellings, including Independence Day (1996), the virus is on our side, destroying alien invaders that lack our acquired immunity.\n\nOne of the most striking twists on this conceit is Greg Bear's novel Blood Music (1985). A scientist, angry at being sacked by his lab, smuggles a virus out into the world in his own body. It infects everybody, becomes self-aware, and assimilates everybody and everything to itself: human beings and their infrastructure melt down into a planetwide sea of hyperintelligent grey goo. It sounds unpleasant, but it's actually a liberation: the accumulation of concentrated consciousness, our own included, punches through a transcendent new realm. The plague becomes a kind of secular Rapture.\n\nIf on some level we still think of contagion as the gods' anger, these stories become about how we have angered the god - about, in other words, our guilt. When Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver planned their reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise, they decided an agent, a neuroenhancer spliced into simian flu, would both raise the apes' level of intelligence and prove fatal to humans. The resulting movie trilogy (2011-17) was more than just a commercial hit; it proved an eloquent articulation of broader environmental concerns. The few surviving humans move through the film's lush rejuvenated forestscapes, compelled to confront avatars of humanity's generational contempt for the natural world.\n\nThe plague that has destroyed us has uplifted these animals, given them wisdom, and they are angry with us - why wouldn't they be? It's a common genre trope. The scientist in Alistair MacLean's The Satan Bug (1965) is an environmental fundamentalist who hopes his germ will wipe out humanity. The mad scientists from Channel 4's TV drama Utopia (2013\u201114) and Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake trilogy are both driven by the same animus.\n\nHaving invested ourselves with the crown of all creation, coronavirus arrives to puncture our hubris. Think of the computer intelligence Agent Smith in The Matrix (1999), played with sneering panache by Hugo Weaving: humans, he tells Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus, are incapable of developing a natural equilibrium with their environment: \"You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.\" In this telling, we are the virus.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_roberts@theguardian.com", "name": "Adam Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Koontz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dean Koontz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apollo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iliad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sparta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_(disease)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plague (disease)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biological agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thucydides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Greece"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryx_and_Crake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oryx and Crake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tiptree_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Tiptree Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pericles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City-state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Atwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Atwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Russ", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joanna Russ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "H.

Britain is not at war with coronavirus. The phrase and its cognates should be banned. Those who exploit them to heighten panic and win obedience to authority should be dismissed from public office.\n\nLast week the prime minister, Boris Johnson, leaped from two weeks of inertia to give his Churchill impersonation. He donned a costume to look like a health worker. He dived into Cobra, haunt of publicity-hungry prime ministers, and pushed aside his health secretary, Matt Hancock. Aides drew up a \"battle plan\" to confront forecasts of 80% of Britons who \"might be\" infected, and 500,000 who might be dead.\n\nWar is the absolute last resort of a nation facing existential collapse. It implies extreme violence. Words such as battles, fights, enemies and threats to nations are clearly directed at accreting power and suspending liberty. They encourage xenophobia and attacks on supposed \"enemy agents\" - at present, Asian communities. To promote this under the cover of any \"worst-case scenario\" is inexcusable.\n\nNever, Johnson must have murmured, would so many owe so much ... to oneself. He stood behind a crested lectern, flanked by two scientists like five-star generals. He declared a four-point emergency strategy, plus 27 pages of \"sweeping new powers\" to meet \"a national challenge\". He would call up retired health workers and army units. It was his first dry run at war.\n\nThe prime minister's attempt to inspire calm was ridiculous. If calm was needed, why was he there? Within hours, the stock market plunged. Hundreds of flights were cancelled, even to places untouched by the virus. Workers were told to stay at home. Holiday bookings collapsed. Even James Bond was ordered to take fright and scurry home.\n\nWhen hysteria is rife, we might try some history. In 1997 we were told that bird flu could kill millions worldwide. Thankfully, it did not. In 1999 European Union scientists warned that BSE \"could kill 500,000 people\". In total, 177 Britons died of vCJD. The first Sars outbreak of 2003 was reported by as having \"a 25% chance of killings tens of millions\" and being \"worse than Aids\". In 2006, another bout of bird flu was declared \"the first pandemic of the 21st century\", the scares in 2003, 2004 and 2005 having failed to meet their body counts.\n\nThen, in 2009, pigs replaced birds. The BBC announced that swine flu \"could really explode\". The chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, declared that \"65,000 could die\". He spent \u00a3560m on a Tamiflu and Relenza stockpile, which soon deteriorated. The Council of Europe's health committee chairman described the hyping of the 2009 pandemic as \"one of the great medical scandals of the century\". These scenarios could have all have come to pass of course - but they represent the direr end of the scale of predictions. Should public life really be conducted on a worst-case basis?\n\nBoth Hancock and Britain's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, have struggled to contain the alarm. The government's action plan pointed out that the virus is highly contagious, but the \"great majority\" of those who develop symptoms will experience only a \"mild-to-moderate but self-limiting illness\". Every medical expert I have heard on the subject is reasonable and calm.\n\nNot so politicians and the media. They love playing to the gallery, as they do after every health scare and terrorist incident. Front pages are outrageous. No BBC presenter seems able to avoid the subject. Wash hands to save the nation. The BBC must be sponsored by the soap industry.\n\nIt is always hard to reflect balance and perspective in news. In this case, it is surely essential. It would help if Hancock was handed back the virus brief by Downing Street. It would also help if events were not cancelled, factories and offices not closed, and holidays not abandoned.\n\nOf course, I could be wrong. I could get ill. Millions could die. But it is also possible that come the spring, this crisis will have passed. So for the moment, if you see a virus story containing \"might\" \"could\" \"possibly\" or worst-case scenario\", stop reading. You are being fed war talk. Let them wash your hands, but not your brain.\n\n* Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I was told it's being prepared'", "body": "What's the difference between playing a president on screen and being one in real life? Not much, according to Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the man who's done both.\n\n\"It's very similar,\" he says, his compact frame engulfed by a green leather armchair in his opulent presidential office. Then he changes his mind: in fact, the real job lasts a whole five years, and comes with far greater challenges than can fit into one season of a television show. \"It's true there are more problems. They are catastrophic. They appear, I'm sorry to say, like pimples on an 18-year-old kid. You don't know where they will pop up, or when.\" The 42-year-old speaks in his native Russian, his expressive face switching from boyish amusement to tortured concern in a flash.\n\nThe latest problem is coronavirus. Angry villagers, scared their hospital is hosting returnees from China, have attacked the buses transporting them. The day before we meet, Zelenskiy dispatched his health minister to join the evacuees in quarantine, as proof they pose no danger. \"It was her choice, but I suggested it,\" he says, chuckling in a way that implies he gave her little alternative.\n\nIt is exactly the kind of impetuous decision his television alter ego might have taken. In the Ukrainian series Servant Of The People, Zelenskiy plays an everyman with no political experience who is elevated to the country's presidency. Last April, a couple of weeks after the season three finale aired, he took 73% of the vote in the country's actual presidential election. In May, he started the job for real. In an era of outsider electoral successes, Zelenskiy's has been perhaps the most unlikely of them all.\n\nRunning a country of 42 million people that in the past few years has seen a revolution, a land-grab by Vladimir Putin and an ongoing war in its eastern regions was not going to be an easy task, especially for a political novice. But Zelenskiy's first real-life presidential season has thrown up one plotline that even his show's scriptwriters might have discarded as implausible, involving another unlikely president, from across the Atlantic.\n\nAfter decades in which US politicians have chided Ukraine for its venal politics, it's ironic that an American president should try to corrupt his Ukrainian counterpart. Donald Trump wanted one thing from Zelenskiy: an investigation into the Ukrainian business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Joe - his potential 2020 presidential opponent. Until he complied, Trump made it clear through aides that he would withhold $391m (\u00a3303m) in military aid, along with Zelenskiy's chance of a coveted White House visit. Trump's interactions with Zelenskiy were at the crux of his impeachment trial in January, with the most damning evidence released by Trump himself: a memorandum of a 25 July call between the leaders. In it, Zelenskiy flatters Trump, while delicately trying not to enter into a criminal conspiracy with him: \"You are a great teacher for us,\" he says, in one of several passages it is hard to read without cringing. Trump, meanwhile, underlines how much the US will do for Ukraine, if only Zelenskiy will order a probe into Hunter Biden.\n\nHis political opponents seized on his fawning tone and he was even dubbed \"Monica Zelenskiy\". \"You are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1,000%,\" he says when Trump claims Angela Merkel \"doesn't do anything\" for Ukraine (in fact, the EU is its largest financial donor). But the scandal resonated more loudly in the US; with Russia-backed troops still in the east of the country, most Ukrainians are sympathetic to maintaining US support at almost any cost.\n\nZelenskiy appeared rattled when Trump released the memo just hours before the two held an awkward press conference at the UN last September. Today, he looks more comfortable discussing the exchange, though he says he is tired of the impeachment saga dominating every conversation about Ukraine. \"I think Ukraine has passed through this story proudly, with its head raised high,\" he says. But he has still not received the promised White House invitation, and it's clear this is an irritation. \"I was told it's being prepared. It's hard for me to hear that. I am a person who works to deadlines. Our diplomats are discussing it with American diplomats. I would like us to have a fruitful meeting.\"\n\nBut the humiliations have kept coming. In late January, two days before secretary of state Mike Pompeo was due to travel to Kyiv in a show of US support, he somewhat undermined the message by snapping at a reporter: \"Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?\" and asking her to point to it on a map, as if it were an obscure principality rather than the biggest country in Europe. When they met, Zelenskiy says, Pompeo insisted he had been misquoted. He says he is \"grateful to the US, because actually both political parties support us\". But what about the president?\n\nZelenskiy pauses and laughs. He draws another breath before giving a long, convoluted and largely meaningless answer about the overwhelming US support he feels, from the president down. There's not much else he can say. Trump is known to be vindictive, and could win another four years in November. On the other hand, if Zelenskiy comes out in full-blooded support, he will look a fool if a Democrat wins the White House. The best option, it seems, is to say nothing.\n\n\"With some issues, I don't really understand how to help journalists. When it comes to matters of state, I'll happily talk to you when my five years are up and tell you lots of things I can't now. But these are state secrets.\"\n\nAfter 10 months in office, Zelenskiy is desperate to move the conversation on from the impeachment saga. He has agreed to a rare interview in the hope that he can \"change the context\" - to his focus on making a deal with Putin to end the war, and on further integration with Europe. He speaks passionately and with much gesturing, deploying the easy charm that helped him win the presidency. His future success will depend on whether he can use it to good effect on the European leaders who are his best hope of escaping his unenviable position, stuck between Trump and Putin.\n\nIn the aftermath of his election victory, Zelenskiy promised voters he would \"stay a human being\" and not become a typical politician. He claims to have succeeded so far, but our surroundings tell a different story. His cavernous office is done out with gilded stucco ceilings, chandeliers and ruched curtains that cascade down long windows. So far, so very presidential. But the handshakes are hardly over before Zelenskiy tells us how ill at ease he is. \"I can't even sit there, it's awful,\" he says, pointing to the wooden desk laden with malachite ornaments and a bank of secure telephones. \"Previous inhabitants felt very at home in these surroundings, I guess,\" he says; they make him feel \"horribly uncomfortable\".\n\nThe most recent renovations were done by president Viktor Yanukovych, whose obscene corruption and cosying up to Russia prompted the 2014 Maidan revolution. We meet six years to the day since Yanukovych fled the building during bloody clashes between riot police and protesters in central Kyiv, setting in train the Russian annexation of Crimea and military incursion into eastern Ukraine.\n\nInitially, Zelenskiy promised he would move the presidential office, but he has now decided the cost to the taxpayer would be prohibitive: \"And I can't do a renovation, because it's a historic building, so it would be illegal.\" But it is noticeable he has not made even small changes, such as replacing the furniture or removing the kitsch bronze figurines. Maybe he needs something to complain about. Or maybe the trappings of power are proving seductive.\n\n\"It's true, you do start getting used to it.\" He laughs.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy was born in 1978, into a Jewish Ukrainian family in Kryvyi Rih, an industrial city in the south-east of Soviet Ukraine, dotted with mines and blast furnaces. It was a tough place to grow up, notorious for gangs of youths fighting to control different neighbourhoods in the years after the Soviet collapse.\n\nZelenskiy's way out came through comedy. A natural performer, he organised a tight-knit group of friends from high school and law school into a comedy troupe named Kvartal 95, after the neighbourhood in which they grew up. By the mid-2000s, the troupe had moved to Kyiv and were appearing regularly on Ukrainian television. Recently, Zelenskiy has brought in some of them as key advisers. \"I have a few people who work with me who have been my friends for a long time... They have no relation to business, or to the budget,\" he says, insisting the appointments are about personal trust, not financial cronyism.\n\nZelenskiy's humour tended toward the slapstick: his audiences preferred Benny Hill to Monty Python, he has said. In one skit, he and a fellow actor appear to play Chopsticks on the piano using only their penises. But there were also more pointed, political sketches, mocking Ukraine's corrupt officials and oligarchs. He came to know some of his targets personally, as he took on more work as a television and film producer, bringing him wealth and connections among the elites. Sometimes this got him into trouble, if a sketch cut too deeply. Occasionally, the group poked fun at the authoritarianism of Ukraine's big neighbour. In a skit to coincide with a Russian presidential election, Zelenskiy and his friends played the returning officers at a local polling station, suicidal because they have accidentally failed to secure a Putin victory in their district.\n\nServant Of The People, a sharp-edged comedy, first aired in 2015. Zelenskiy stars as high-school teacher Vasyl Holoborodko, whose classroom tirade against corruption is filmed by a pupil and posted online, propelling him to the presidency after the post goes viral. Think Yes Minister crossed with House Of Cards, transposed on to the grimly cynical world of post-Soviet politics. The popularity of the show prompted a question, backed up by favourable polling numbers: what if Zelenskiy ran for office in real life? In the final moments of 2018, on his new year television show, he announced that he would.\n\nHe ran a ludicrous, postmodern campaign, the centrepiece of which was a nationwide comedy tour that included video clips of his on-screen president. Mainly, he just wanted to make the audience laugh. One Ukrainians-on-holiday sketch poked fun at a tourist who spends his vacation watching movies on a bus. \"But where did you stop?\" he is asked. \"Somewhere around Terminator 2,\" comes the response.\n\nZelenskiy was up against the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko, a billionaire chocolate magnate who had won the presidency a few months after the Maidan revolution. While Poroshenko had brought some reform, he had failed to deliver on his key promise to end corruption. Lagging in the polls, he was flummoxed by Zelenskiy's insurgent campaign, and tried to paint his opponent as a man who would appease Putin over the war. Meanwhile Zelenskiy largely avoided debate, running a populist campaign - the people against the old elites - but without the usual populist tactic of sowing anger and division. Instead, he made vague talk of unification, fighting corruption and ending the war, with few specifics.\n\nWhen he did agree to a debate, he made it conditional on Poroshenko accepting a set of absurd terms: it would take place on the pitch at Kyiv's 70,000-seater Olympic stadium, and Poroshenko would have to take a drug and alcohol test beforehand, to prove he wasn't high. It wasn't intended as a serious offer, but with nothing to lose, Poroshenko said yes, gamely showing up for blood and urine tests the day before. The debate was loud, confusing and largely senseless - which was how Zelenskiy wanted it. In the stadium, both candidates came across badly, bellowing into microphones; but on television, where it really mattered, Zelenskiy was the clear winner.\n\nThe election was an easy win, too. He came first in almost every region - something new for a country that has long been divided on regional and linguistic lines. In the minutes after his crushing victory was announced, Zelenskiy strode on to the stage at his campaign headquarters accompanied by the lilting theme tune of Servant Of The People. Nobody quite knew what a Zelenskiy presidency would look like, including the people who had voted for him. But after a two-decade cycle of revolution and disappointment, he had won, not despite his lack of experience but because of it. He called parliamentary elections soon after, announcing that his newly formed party (named the Servant Of The People Party, naturally) would nominate a varied field of candidates, most without political experience. It won more than half the parliamentary seats, giving Zelenskiy huge power.\n\nNow that he's in charge, does he regret mocking politicians so mercilessly on his TV show? Zelenskiy smiles. \"I understood that, without experienced people it's impossible to run a country. But these people are at middle level. They are the bureaucrats who know where to scurry to, what to do, whom to bring the papers to.\"\n\nTo manage these bureaucrats, Zelenskiy has enlisted some old friends. Andriy Yermak, the man he entrusted with US negotiations last summer and recently made his chief of staff, is a former copyright lawyer. Serhiy Shefir, another presidential aide, is a co-founder of Zelenskiy's production studio. A childhood friend, Ivan Bakanov, has been made head of the secret services. While Zelenskiy's inner circle do not seem to be seeking personal enrichment, there are legitimate concerns about whether his friends are the best qualified people to run the country.\n\nAlongside these old friends, Zelenskiy put together a cabinet composed largely of well-regarded reformers, and the general feeling in the international community was that his team was doing surprisingly well, against the odds. However, earlier this week, a few days after our interview, he fired most of the government, including the 35-year-old prime minister (and also the still-quarantined health minister). The chief prosecutor, seen as a reformer, was also dismissed by parliament. The move, which Zelenskiy gave no hint was coming during the interview, has been interpreted as a blow for genuine reform efforts.\n\nZelenskiy claimed to us that because he and his circle are demonstrably not on the take, it has become more difficult for anyone else to take a bribe. \"The president can't change the country on his own. But what can he do? He can give an example.\"\n\nWhile Zelenskiy appears to be enjoying himself, he admits the political spotlight has been unwelcome for his family. \"It's difficult,\" he says. \"They don't like my work.\" Going out for a meal has to be cleared with security; taking a nice holiday looks insensitive when his country is at war.\n\nHis wife, Olena, is a former writer for Kvartal 95 who, like Zelenskiy, grew up in Kryvyi Rih. He says that while he is used to being in the public eye, she prefers to stay out of the limelight. His 16-year-old daughter is the most irritated by his new job, bristling against the security detail that now follows her everywhere. They try to hide, but she always spots them, her father says. \"She's at that age when a person is usually most free,\" he says. \"It's unpleasant for her on a human level.\" On the other hand, his seven-year-old son is loving it, proudly announcing to anyone who will listen that his father is the president. \"I came home the other day and I said, 'Why is nobody saying hello to me?' And I can hear my own voice on the television. It was my speech. And my son says, 'Don't disturb us, we're watching the president!'\"\n\nBefore Trump hijacked the script, the main villain to Zelenskiy's hero was meant to be Putin, who annexed Crimea in 2014 and sent money, men and weapons to fuel a war that has killed 14,000 people so far, many of them civilians. Large-scale fighting was halted in 2015, but regular shelling and fatalities on the frontline have been a way of life ever since. Peace could be achieved, Zelenskiy told voters, only if Kyiv began direct negotiations with the Kremlin. This was a radical departure from Poroshenko's approach and proved popular with a nation suffering from war fatigue - though a loud minority accused Zelenskiy of capitulating to Russia by even proposing talks. But he says he values saving lives over counting territorial gains. \"Who is this all being done for? For people. What's the point of returning our territory if a million people die?\"\n\nPutin and Zelenskiy met face to face for the first time in December, at a summit in Paris, alongside Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel. They mainly stuck to the technical details of a long-ignored peace treaty, but \"there were a few emotional parts\", Zelenskiy recalls: when Putin complained about radical Ukrainian nationalists, he fired back that Russia has radicals, too. Was he able to get through to Putin? \"I think he listened to me. I had that feeling. I hope it's not a false feeling.\" The talks produced modest results: prisoner exchanges, an agreement to disengage military forces, and a ceasefire that has not held, with one soldier killed and several injured in a deadly flare-up in recent weeks.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Putin will agree to any peace deal remotely acceptable to Ukrainian public opinion, but Zelenskiy says he wants to move fast. \"Time is ticking,\" he says, pointing at his watch and announcing a timeframe of a year in which to solve the conflict, so he can focus on other domestic issues. \"The government can spend one year on the entire agreement. Then it should be implemented. Any longer is prohibited. If it lasts longer, we need to change the format and choose another strategy,\" he says. It's a dramatic new deadline, but his urgency is undercut by a lack of detail. (At times like this, Zelenskiy sounds rather Trumpian.) He declines to say what the fallback strategy might be, and when his press secretary jumps in to clarify that the one-year deadline dates from the December summit, rather than the start of his presidency in May, he replies with a laugh: \"I don't know any more.\" Thinking on the fly, as he often appears to, he buys himself the extra months: yes, it starts from the summit.\n\nZelenskiy's aides present this kind of improvisation as part of his charm. In meetings with foreign dignitaries, they say, he will read the room and, if he feels he can succeed with a more emotional pitch, discard official briefing notes. And perhaps this might work with Merkel, for one, who reportedly watched clips from Servant Of The People before meeting Zelenskiy.\n\nConvincing Merkel and others of Ukraine's desire for closer integration into Europe is vital, he says. \"We need to give people confidence that the European Union is waiting for Ukraine,\" he says. If it takes 20 years, his electorate will lose hope. \"People don't really believe in words. Or rather, people believe in words only for a stretch of time. Then they start to look for action.\" Merkel gets it, he thinks; he also claims to have developed a warm personal relationship with Macron, though he is wary of the French president's recent references to the need for warmer relations with Moscow.\n\nWatching Brexit unfold from Kyiv has been a strange experience, he says - seeing a country rush to exit the EU when Ukraine is so keen to join. \"It's like having a group of people around a table spending a nice evening together. If someone doesn't want to sit at the table, he'll definitely ruin the party,\" he says, warming to his metaphor. \"And then there are people standing outside the door, ringing the doorbell, knocking, and they're told through the peephole: 'Yes, you're welcome to join but come back next time!' And they're still outside knocking when the party is over.\"\n\nHe revels in these colourful comparisons, which sometimes take him in the wrong direction. He likens his presidency to being on a boat: \"There are holes everywhere, and with your arms and legs, you are trying to close them up. This is how we're living. We are closing the holes.\" When told it sounds like a sinking ship, Zelenskiy looks alarmed, and adds: \"But we're not sinking!\"\n\nWhen he came to power, western diplomats worried Zelenskiy might be a proxy for Ihor Kolomoisky, a controversial billionaire whose television channel aired his show. Kolomoisky is one of a group of oligarchs who made vast fortunes in the transition from communism, while most Ukrainians remained poor. In recent years, they have rebranded themselves as generous philanthropists, while retaining an outsized influence on the political scene, and are far more deserving of the \"oligarch\" title than their counterparts in Russia, long since neutered by Putin.\n\n\"I want them to have walk-on parts, not leading roles,\" Zelenskiy says. Kolomoisky receives no special treatment, he insists, despite their long acquaintance. He dismisses as \"inappropriate\" the recent purchase of a 14-bedroom mansion on the French Riviera for \u20ac200m (\u00a3170m) by Rinat Akhmetov, a businessman whose apartment at One Hyde Park was the most expensive property ever purchased in the UK when he bought it in 2011, at \u00a3136m.\n\nMany in Kyiv see Zelenskiy's government reshuffle this week as a sign that the old oligarchic players are reasserting their influence, despite his public claims that it was about speeding up reform. It's certainly true that Ukraine's oligarchs continue to wield tremendous power, and Zelenskiy won't be rid of their machinations simply by asking nicely. His TV president might have ordered them hanged or shot for such lavish expenditure abroad during a time of war, but the real Zelenskiy will have to work with them, asking them to invest at home and fund state projects when asked.\n\n\"If we've chosen democracy, of course we can't hang people,\" he says, but a twinkle appears in his eyes. \"Although! Sometimes you really want to. And do you know why? Because it would be quicker. Much quicker,\" he says, delivering the line with a comic's timing.\n\n\"We are joking,\" says his press secretary, looking somewhat concerned, from the other side of the table.\n\n\"Of course we're joking,\" Zelenskiy says.\n\nIn their ill-fated phone call, Zelenskiy thanked Trump for providing him with a model of electoral success. \"We used quite a few of your skills... we wanted to drain the swamp here in my country,\" he says. Is that true, or was he simply following advice that the US president responds well to flattery? He sighs and answers carefully. What Trump showed him, he says, was how an outsider can win without having to adapt to the supposed rules of the game. \"I do not try to play a role. I feel good being myself and saying what I think. And in this, he really was an example - of how you can win without using the standard format.\"\n\nZelenskiy thinks the era of the political outsider is just starting and his own campaign model could succeed elsewhere. \"I am certain it could, especially where people are tired, where they are running like squirrels on a wheel, and there are these long-standing politicians with big financial resources. In these places, where people are searching for a breath of fresh air, it should work.\"\n\nIt sounds like a clear allusion to Ukraine's neighbour to the east, and its indefatigable leader. Indeed, on the night of his election, Zelenskiy said he wanted his victory to be an example to the entire post-Soviet region, dominated by autocrats. His success has not gone unnoticed inside Russia, and many have made favourable comparisons with the man in the Kremlin: Zelenskiy walking to his inauguration, high-fiving members of the crowd, versus a lonely Putin in his limousine, gliding through the emptied streets of Moscow to his own ceremony. Zelenskiy's chummy, upbeat new year message to the nation, versus Putin's staid television address. A Russian channel recently started to broadcast Servant Of The People, but quickly reversed the decision, presumably fearing its message was too subversive.\n\nZelenskiy did not, in the end, bring down Trump, and he may well not succeed in his plans to remodel Ukraine. Could Zelenskiy's legacy turn out to be piercing Putin's aura of infallibility? \"Of course a new president will appear there. Of course it will happen. What kind of president it will be, I don't know,\" he says. \"But we can see that all totalitarian regimes end the same way.\"\n\nBut Putin would never simply give up power to a Zelenskiy figure in Russia. Is he predicting a bloody revolution? \"I don't want people to die anywhere,\" he says. \"But we should understand that if you keep tightening the spring, at some point it will snap.\"\n\n* If you

"body": "An overwhelming majority of doctors fear that the NHS is not well prepared to deal with a major outbreak of coronavirus, a survey has found.\n\nMore than 99% of 1,618 NHS medics questioned appear not to agree with the assurances given by Boris Johnson that the service will cope if it is hit by a surge in people falling ill.\n\nDoctors are worried that the NHS is already stretched and under heavy pressure, and especially that it has too few intensive care beds and that GP surgeries are struggling to meet patient demand.\n\n\"Yesterday Mr Johnson said he was 'very, very confident' the NHS would be able to deal with an outbreak of Covid-19. Our survey shows that frontline doctors don't agree,\" said Dr Rinesh Parmar, the chair of the Doctors' Association UK, which undertook the survey.\n\n\"The truth is the NHS has already been brought to its knees and many doctors fear that our health system simply won't cope in the event of influx of coronavirus patients.\n\n\"With nearly 10,000 doctor vacancies and 43,000 nurse vacancies [in the NHS in England] the NHS is already understaffed to deal with demand. A&E waiting times are the worst on record. Intensive care units are at capacity and are even struggling to admit patients who are critically unwell or awaiting cancer surgery.\"\n\nSurvey respondents were asked: do you feel the NHS is well prepared for coronavirus? Only eight of the 1,618 who replied said they thought it was. The survey was a self-selecting rather than representative sample of the UK's medical workforce.\n\nThe prime minister said on Sunday that the NHS had plans in place and the resources to deal with large numbers of people falling ill because of the virus. Thirty-six cases have been confirmed across the four home nations so far, 32 of them in England.\n\nSpeaking at a Public Health England laboratory in London where swab samples from people who may have the virus are tested, Johnson said: \"I think the crucial thing for the public to understand is coronavirus is of concern, it is a novel illness, but it's something this country really amply has the resources to deal with.\n\n\"We have state-of-the-art testing facilities, we have a fantastic NHS. We will have to get through this, but believe me we are going to beat it.\"\n\nThe main concerns doctors highlighted in the survey were:\n\nThe NHS is already struggling to meet the existing need for care and so would not be able to cope with a sudden large increase in demand linked to Covid-19.\n\nHospitals have too few intensive care and high-dependency care beds, those units are understaffed and there are no plans to expand such facilities.\n\nGP practices do not have enough appointments to ensure that patients can be seen quickly.\n\nSome hospitals are lacking basic equipment including face masks.\n\nNHS 111 is still telling some people who appear to have symptoms of Covid-19 to go to A&E or an urgent care centre, even though official advice warns against anyone with suspected coronavirus going to A&E or a GP practice.\n\nParmar said doctors had been \"shouting this from the rooftops for some time\". Many hoped the threat of Covid-19 would prompt an honest conversation to address the issue of critical care capacity and our ability to look after our sickest patients. By repeating 'the NHS is well prepared to deal with coronavirus', it seems that yet again doctors' concerns have been brushed under the carpet.\"\n\nSome hospital trust chief executives privately harbour similar concerns.\n\nAn NHS spokesperson said the service was well placed to respond to a surge in cases. They said: \"The NHS has well-established escalation plans in place, and hardworking staff are working round the clock caring for those who have contracted the coronavirus and putting measures in place to help stop it spreading.\"\n\nThe Guardian approached the Department of Health and Social Care for a response to the survey findings.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

"Quitting the EU's Erasmus student exchange programme would \"blow a hole\" in the UK's economy, taking away income of \u00a3243m a year and depriving 17,000 British young people of valuable work experience, according to a group of education and business leaders.\n\nThe group - including further education colleges and universities - is calling for the British government to make clear that continued Erasmus membership is a high priority in its talks with the EU.\n\nBritain's membership of the EU-wide exchange scheme known as Erasmus+ is to expire at the end of this year, alongside membership of the EU. But the government's negotiating outline offered scant hope of continued full membership, saying only that it \"will consider options for participation in elements of Erasmus+ on a time-limited basis, provided the terms are in the UK's interests\".\n\nUniversities UK International (UUKI), the umbrella group representing higher education providers, said membership of Erasmus gave a bonus to the British economy worth \u00a3243m a year, after subtracting membership costs from the \u00a3420m generated by EU students visiting the UK under the programme.\n\nAnd it said that the 17,000 British students and young people who use Erasmus for work placements and study would also lose out - especially students from disadvantaged backgrounds who would struggle to fund their travel and expenses without it.\n\nJoe Fitzsimons, head of education and skills policy at the Institute of Directors (IoD), said: \"Many employers deeply value the kind of international experience the Erasmus scheme helps foster. Given the benefits it can bring students and businesses, maintaining access to Erasmus and wider EU research and education partnerships has been a priority for the IoD from the off.\"\n\nEmma Meredith, international director at the Association of Colleges (AoC), representing further education, said its data showed 85% of colleges were using Erasmus+ to find work placements that were not available with local employers, particularly for students in vocational subjects such as construction and social care.\n\n\"For college students in some of the most deprived parts of the country, Erasmus+ helps to level up opportunity, experience and aspiration as well as ensuring that we are viewed as an open, tolerant and welcoming country to the rest of the world,\" Meredith said.\n\nAn AoC survey found more than 90% of colleges would be unable to fund work placements for further education students if Erasmus was not extended or replaced.\n\nThe director of UUKI, Vivienne Stern, said: \"We know that disadvantaged and disabled students have the most to gain from an international experience. They will be the students who will lose the most if Erasmus+ falls by the wayside.\n\n\"Yet I am worried that government isn't committed to keeping the UK in Erasmus. Now is the time to commit to this unique programme that boosts not only students' prospects, but those of businesses and the economy.\"\n\nThe Department for Education has previously said the government \"is committed to continuing the academic relationship between the UK and the EU, including through the next Erasmus+ programme if it is in our interests to do so\".\n\nThe UK's post-Brexit membership of Erasmus is likely to hinge on the EU's stance on the cost of continuing membership, and whether the EU ties it to another top priority: continued access for UK universities to the EU's Horizon 2020 research programme, worth billions of euros.\n\nLosing access to either the Horizon or Erasmus programmes would be a further blow for universities struggling with a student recruitment difficulties, including potentially huge losses in international tuition fees caused by the coronavirus disruption.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_adams@theguardian.com", "name": "Richard Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erasmus+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erasmus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Directors", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Institute of Directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Further education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_exchange_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Student exchange program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_UK", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Universities UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Education", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Department for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vocational education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuition_payments", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuition payments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_Programmes_for_Research_and_Technological_Development", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73f2a90d4888c577ec2614b9464d952ea998bbe7/0_57_2216_1330/master/2216.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=d44720a0eb0ee57b51ab40386aca748f", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1914}, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 1914, "relevance": 2}, {"uri": "1475842214", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-08", "time": "18:37:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-08T18:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-08T18:15:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/china-ill-not-only-coronavirus-communist-party-control", "title": "China is ill, but not only because of coronavirus | Ai Weiwei", "body": "The regime's power relies on intimidation and censorship. Right now, mistrust is a contagion it is struggling to control\n\nIn China, people from the city of Wuhan are jokingly referred to as \"nine-headed birds\" because of their habit of inveterate squabbling. In recent weeks, though, an eerie silence has descended on their world. Empty streets, empty malls. Everyone kept indoors. The government says 80,000 are infected by coronavirus, and more than 3,000 have died in China.\n\nThis pandemic has now spread to more than 100 countries and territories. Is the city just one big prison-hospital? News and rumour arrive round the clock online, but that dismal barrage in a sense only makes things worse. A few people can't take the pressure, climb to a top floor and jump into black silence below.\n\nViewed from the outside, the city might seem like a giant aquarium. Visible fish swim silently while not a drop of water leaks out. Police have welded doors shut in order to monitor who enters and leaves buildings. Roads out of the city are cut with deep trenches or blocked by walls. Even little paths that lead towards farmland have been destroyed. Swim down a river? There are nets to catch you.\n\nThe famous bustle of Wuhan people takes some macabre forms. Crematoriums advertise online. Face-masks command high prices, and the market in body bags grows. In an absurdist gesture, people in some neighbourhoods open their windows to join their neighbours in choral renditions of pro-government songs.\n\nIn a city of 13 million, how many poignant stories must there be? We will never hear most of them, but here is one: a young man comes home to visit his ageing parents to see in the new year. The parents have long been wishing that he would marry, but he has not been able to attract a girlfriend. Not wanting to disappoint, he hires a young lady to come home with him as his \"fiancee\", sleeping in a separate bedroom. The two have agreed that after leaving Wuhan they will revert to being casual acquaintances. But the virus strikes and they are trapped in the parents' apartment. The young woman endures - slicing tofu and making small talk with her \"future mother-in-law\". Nothing can be done about that.\n\nIn normal times, the nine-headed birds of Wuhan are full of opinions on all sorts of political and cultural topics, but the searing question of the virus has thrust everything else into the background. Life and death are at stake, and it is terrifying that something that so monopolises attention is also unknowable. Where did the virus come from? How far has it spread? How long will the epidemic last? Such questions, shrouded in opacity and lacking any solid ground on which even to invite answers, can make it seem that civilisation itself is in question.\n\nThe communist system, with its tight control of information and its accountability of officials only to their bureaucratic superiors, not to the people below, has been undermining social trust for decades. Citizens do not expect a volte-face in trust just because a deadly virus appears. But without trust, people's immune system against lies breaks down.In the public sphere, all belief becomes ungrounded belief.\n\nStatements float like clouds, beyond truth or falsity. Questions about a virus - what happened and why? - should be empirical questions that have determinable answers. But not in China, where the problem is not even lack of knowledge so much as lack of a system in which knowledge is possible. China's officialdom does have a scale on which it measures the value of particular statements, but the criterion is not truth or falsity - it is how well the statement does something that authorities want to see done.\n\nIt will not be easy to stop the rot of trust in China, because its spread is already deep. Moreover there is the very daunting problem that the Communist party does not want transparency and trust. The party's power rests crucially on two cornerstones: intimidation and control of information. This is because a populace both frightened and blind is pliable.\n\nI have been living in exile for several years. I feel a constant pull to connect with life in Wuhan - I mean with real life, not the cloud of opaque language. What are people actually feeling? Can that hired \"bride\" go home now, I wonder? Can the young man's parents come to terms with the truth? Will any of them get good information on the virus so that they can know where they stand?\n\nPerhaps I have inherited something from my father, the poet Ai Qing. One of his most famous poems, I Love this Land, was written in 1938 as the city of Wuhan fell before the Japanese military:\n\nIf I were a bird\n\nI would sing myself hoarse\n\nAbout this land torn by storm\n\nThis raging river that surges around our anger\n\nThis furious wind that roars without end\n\nAnd about the ever-gentle dawn that rises through the trees\n\nThen die\n\nEven my feathers to rot in the earth\n\nWhy are there always tears in my eyes?\n\nI love this land too deeply\n\nChina is ill, yes - but from much more than a coronavirus. The world panics - but only about the virus, not about the deeper illness. China interlocks with the world economically and, in recent years, in some political ways too. If its systemic illness continues to worsen, and to spread by contagion, the world may have to face the existential questions that the illness raises: can civilisation survive without trust? Can government that lacks legitimacy survive indefinitely?\n\n* Ai Weiwei is a contemporary artist, activist and advocate of political reform in China", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ai_weiwei@theguardian.com", "name": "Ai Weiwei", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_(optics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opacity (optics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Absurdism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aquarium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trench warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tofu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_Qing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ai Qing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public sphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buoyancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empirical evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_Weiwei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ai Weiwei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feather"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eec6079367d2b7fdb191c289b87f811dd5f6785/0_237_5360_3216/master/5360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=e29a7d6c7bcdd1267a895edd7fb31479", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1911}, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 1911, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1469972504", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-04", "time": "00:43:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-04T00:43:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-04T00:29:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-live-updates-who-global-recession-fears-update-latest-news", "title": "Coronavirus live updates: WHO warns protective gear 'rapidly depleting' amid recession fears", "body": "Welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus.

Europe's largest regional airline, has collapsed into administration less than two months after the government announced a rescue deal.\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus on flight bookings proved the last straw for the Exeter-based airline, which operates almost 40% of UK domestic flights, as the government stalled on a controversial \u00a3100m loan.\n\nThe UK Civil Aviation Authority announced early on Thursday morning that the airline had entered administration.\n\nIt said all flights were cancelled and urged passengers not to go to airports.\n\nFlybe's bankruptcy has come just a week before a budget that it hoped would help bolster its precarious finances, after the previous chancellor said he would look again at levels of air passenger duty (APD) .\n\nHowever, the airline's owners Connect Airways - a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and hedge fund Cyrus Capital - have pulled the plug, a little over a year after buying it.\n\nThe airline employed more than 2,000 people and was one of the leading carriers at airports including Belfast, Southampton, Manchester and Birmingham. Around 8 million people a year used its services. Unions have warned that other jobs would be put at risk by Flybe's collapse, and transport links lost on dozens of domestic routes where it is the sole operator.\n\nFlybe has long struggled to balance the books, despite cost-cutting plans and redundancies, and was reporting losses of around \u00a320m a year before the Connect takeover.\n\nWith the new government having promised to \"level up\" the economy, it was anxious to demonstrate it was helping the ailing airline and ministers announced the Flybe rescue in January. However, the measures - which included some deferral of tax, a potential loan, and promises to review regional air connectivity and APD levels - have not proved enough.\n\nPublic anxiety and curbs on business travel due to the coronavirus outbreak have forced airlines around the world to retrench in the face of falling bookings, and Flybe was also suffering from the drop in demand.\n\nVirgin Atlantic itself is having to make significant cuts, and earlier on Wednesday announced it was putting in place crisis measures - including cutting executive pay, freezing hiring and pay rises, and offering unpaid leave to staff - as bookings at the airline have fallen by almost 50% in the last week due to Covid-19 fears.\n\nThe government has been unwilling to bail out Flybe, despite calls from unions and MPs in the regions, with other airlines, led by British Airways owner IAG and Ryanair, objecting about the prospect of state aid and threatening legal action.\n\nIt is the second major British airline to go bankrupt in six months, following the collapse of Thomas Cook last September.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

Conservative Union revealed on Saturday that someone who took part in its recent grassroots conservative conference, CPAC, which was attended by Donald Trump and the US vice-president, Mike Pence, has tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nThe organization put out a statement on Twitter on Saturday evening that said one of the CPAC attendees \"has unfortunately tested positive\" and noted that their \"exposure\" occurred before the conference. The gathering took place in Oxon Hill, Maryland, in late February and was attended by many leading party figures as well as thousands of grassroots members, often accompanied by spouses, children and friends.\n\n\"A New Jersey hospital tested the person and the CDC [the federal public health agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] confirmed the result. The individual is under the care of medical professionals in New Jersey and has been quarantined,\" the statement continued.\n\nIt informed anyone with concerns to contact the ACU or the department of health of the state of Maryland and urged people to remain calm.\n\nThe statement said: \"This attendee had no contact with the president or vice-president and never attended the events in the main hall.\"\n\nIt noted that the Trump administration had been informed of the situation.\n\n\"We will continue regular communication with all appropriate government officials,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe ACU chairman, Matt Schlapp, had previously tweeted a proud message about introducing the president at the CPAC event last weekend.\n\nHe then retweeted several posts from a journalist at the conservative-leaning RealClearPolitics media outlet.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the White House.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joanna_walters@theguardian.com", "name": "Joanna Walters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The American Conservative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Political_Action_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Political Action Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxon_Hill,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxon Hill, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxon Hill, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Schlapp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Schlapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18dffa90bd3319bb3e57e0bd5baee3fa6f619201/0_180_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f7ceae7de0e3af93f07bb47985b0c754", "eventUri": "eng-5580415", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1634}, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 1634, "relevance": 52}], "totalResults": 449, "page": 1, "count": 25, "pages": 18}}
