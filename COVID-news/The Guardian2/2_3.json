It is critical that public health guidelines are followed.\"\n\nTwo people have died from the virus in Italy since Friday and more than a hundred cases have now been reported, most of them centred around the small town of Codogno, about 40 miles south-east of Milan.\n\nThose living in the affected areas now face what the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said could be weeks of lockdown. The final two days of the Venice carnival were cancelled and Milan fashion week was also affected.\n\nIran has had eight deaths from the virus, the highest toll of any country outside China. The latest three deaths reported on Sunday were among 15 new confirmed cases, bringing the overall number of infections to 43.\n\nFour new infections surfaced in the capital, Tehran, seven in the city of Qom, two in Gilan and one each in Markazi and Tonekabon, the health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said.\n\nPakistan responded by closing its land border with Iran, while Afghanistan said it was suspending travel to Iran \"to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and protect the public\". Turkey also closed its borders and said it would halt incoming flights, adding that all motorways and railways at the border would be shut on Sunday afternoon.\n\nJordan, meanwhile, will not allow entry to citizens of China, Iran and South Korea and other foreigners travelling from those countries in response to the deadly outbreak.\n\nAnnouncing his decision to raise South Korea's alert level on Sunday, Moon said the government and the local authorities should not hesitate to take \"unprecedented, powerful\" measures to contain the viral disease without being limited by \"regulations\".\n\nAs his country struggled to contain theoutbreak in the city of Daegu, the president described the coming days as \"a very important moment\", the news agency Yonhap said.\n\nOf the 123 new cases, 75 were related to the Shincheonji church in Daegu, the country's fourth-largest city, and a neighbouring hospital.\n\nThe Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they had placed more than 9,000 Shincheonji members in self-quarantine and thousands of worshippers had been screened for the virus.\n\nThe raising of the alert level came as a Japanese government minister apologised after a woman allowed to leave the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess on Wednesday tested positive for the infection on Saturday, raising more questions about the country's management of the outbreak.\n\nWarning that China's virus epidemic was \"still grim and complex,\" the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, called on Sunday for more efforts to stop the outbreak, revive industry and prevent the disease from disrupting the spring planting of crops. Xi defended the ruling Communist party's response as \"timely and effective\" in a video conference with officials in charge of anti-disease work, according to the official Xinhua news agency.\n\n\"The current epidemic situation is still grim and complex,\" Xinhua cited Xi as saying. \"Prevention and control are at the most critical stage.\"\n\nAFP and the Associated Press

members of same family die during self-quarantine at centre of outbreak in Wuhan\n\nA Chinese film director, his sister, mother and father have all died from the coronavirus, the latest high-profile victims of the disease in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak.\n\nChang Kai, 55, died on 14 February. His parents died over the previous two weeks, after the family spent days together in self-quarantine, the Chinese magazine Caixin reported. Chang's sister died hours after he did, and his wife is in a serious condition.\n\nDeath rates in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei provinces have been higher than in the rest of China and beyond. Many patients reported struggling to find a bed in hospitals filled far beyond capacity, even as the government built new hospitals and converted spaces like an exhibition centre into makeshift medical centres.\n\nOthers have died despite intensive medical care including a whistleblower doctor and the head of a hospital. An environmental activist and his wife are also thought to have been killed by coronavirus, although they were not tested for the disease.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said that although the disease would be mild in four of five patients, about 20% will have more severe symptoms.\n\nThere are concerns that initial government advice for those with symptoms to stay at home may have exacerbated the toll from the disease, with close confinement leading to whole families being infected.\n\nChang had nursed his father at home after he fell sick in late January. He took the older man to several hospitals, but could not find a bed, Caixin reported. On 28 January he was the family's first victim but others had already become infected.\n\nChang's mother died a few days later, then he became seriously ill. The director sent a deathbed message to friends, describing his grief and sending love to his son in London. \"Farewell to those I love and to those who loved me!\"\n\nAuthorities are taking suspected coronavirus patients to quarantine centres, sometimes forcibly.\n\nThe home quarantine policy could have caused clusters of cross-household and cross-community infections by allowing serious infections to progress without treatment, Caixin reported, quoting Chen Bo, a professor at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan.\n\nThe virus has infected more than 73,000 people and killed 1,875, according to latest data. The vast majority of those cases have been in China, within Hubei province.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_graham_harrison@theguardian.com", "name": "Emma Graham-Harrison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caixin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caixin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convention center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 70}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Digestive_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Digestive Disorders", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be79d1df6173e878d1b836f741172d5b698283f0/0_26_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=b67cb0644f39cbcb67ad484228a82ae2", "eventUri": "eng-5524989", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 3993}, "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 3993, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1458059133", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-23", "time": "12:06:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-23T12:06:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-23T11:41:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/italy-draconian-measures-effort-halt-coronavirus-outbreak-spread", "title": "Italy brings in draconian measures in effort to halt coronavirus spread", "body": "Italian authorities have implemented draconian measures to try to halt the coronavirus outbreak in the north of the country, including imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas, as cases of the virus in the country rose to more than 100.\n\nPolice are patrolling 11 towns - mostly in the Lombardy region, where the first locally transmitted case emerged - that have been in lockdown since Friday night.\n\nMeasures were stepped up after a 78-year-old Italian man infected with the virus died in the Veneto region. A postmortem performed on a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy on Saturday also confirmed that she was infected, but it is unclear if the virus caused her death. The woman is reported to have been recovering from pneumonia and had visited the emergency unit of a hospital in Codogno, near Lodi, a few hours after the first man confirmed to have contracted the disease, a 38-year-old, had passed through.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, there were 89 confirmed cases in Lombardy - two in its industrial capital of Milan - 16 in Veneto, three in Piedmont - including two in Turin - and two in Emilia-Romagna.\n\n\"Unfortunately this means that on a national basis the number has exceeded 100,\" Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy, told Sky.\n\nAbout 50,000 residents across the towns under lockdown have been told to stay home and avoid social contact, while schools, shops and businesses, apart from chemists, have been closed and festivities and sporting events including Serie A football matches cancelled.\n\nMilan's fashion week has also been affected by the outbreak. Giorgio Armani, whose show was scheduled for 4pm on Sunday afternoon, announced on Saturday night that guests should not come to the venue. Instead, the collection would be shown to an empty room.\n\n\"The decision was taken to safeguard the wellbeing of all his [Armani's] invited guests by not having them attend crowded spaces,\" said a press release.\n\nModels still presented the clothes, with the show streamed on the brand's website, as well as Instagram and Facebook.\n\nGiuseppe Conte, the Italian prime minister, said: \"We have adopted a decree to protect the health of Italians, which is our priority and which ranks first in the list of constitutional values.\" He urged people to \"have faith in the political and scientific institutions, which are doing everything possible\".\n\nHundreds of colleagues who worked with the first infected man, a researcher at Unilever, are being tested but it is still unclear who he contracted the illness from. The man, who is in intensive care, was initially thought to have caught the virus after meeting a colleague who had recently returned from China, but the colleague tested negative.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the person who was considered to be 'patient zero' was not,\" said Fontana. \"We need to look elsewhere. We are following two hypotheses, and we will try to understand if one of the two is correct.\"\n\nA keen runner, the 38-year-old recently took part in a number of races. His pregnant wife is also infected, as is a person who went running with the man. Three other cases in Lombardy are elderly people who frequented a bar in the town of Codogno, near Lodi, that is owned by the father of the man who went running with the 38-year-old.\n\nThe man who died in Veneto was diagnosed with pneumonia a few weeks ago but had not travelled to China nor come into contact with anyone who had.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we haven't managed to limit the spread of the virus,\" Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan, which has also closed, told the Guardian.\n\n\"And we need to face the fact that it is spreading quickly. At first, we thought that the virus was only abroad, but now it is also in Italy. People should try not to panic but limiting the spread is, in part, down to our behaviour. Those who have been in contact with someone infected must isolate themselves. Crowded places should also be avoided; sacrifices need to be made to try to overcome the virus.\"\n\nThe first two cases of the virus in Italy were that of a Chinese couple from Wuhan who arrived in the country on 23 January.

"Authorities act on cluster of infections in the Lombardy and Veneto regions\n\nA dozen towns in northern Italy effectively went into lockdown on Saturday after deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China, and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad.\n\nThe secondary contagions prompted authorities in some Lombardy and Veneto towns to close schools, businesses and restaurants, and to cancel sporting events and religious services. The mayor of Milan, Italy's business capital and the regional capital of Lombardy, shuttered public offices.\n\nA 78-year-old man infected with the coronavirus died in Veneto, and a postmortem test performed on a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy came back positive, although it wasn't clear if illness from the virus caused her death.\n\nHundreds of residents and workers who had come into contact with people who tested positive were put into isolation pending results of their tests. Civil protection crews set up a tent camp outside a closed hospital in Veneto to screen medical staff.\n\nIn the town of Codogno, where the first patient identified in the northern cluster was in a critical condition, closed supermarkets, restaurants and shops made the main street practically a ghost town. The few people outside wore face masks, which were coveted items after selling out at pharmacies.\n\nLate Saturday, civil protection officials said 79 people had contracted the virus, including the two who died, and one who recovered. Of the remaining 76 people infected, 54 were in Lombardy, 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia-Romagna, two - a Chinese couple from Wuhan - in Lazio, and one in Piedmont.\n\nLombardy government authorities said the region's cases were traceable to a 38-year-old Italian who had not travelled to China, but it remained unclear how this man had been infected. Ten towns in Lombardy received orders to suspend nonessential activities and services.\n\nLuca Zaia, the Veneto regional president, said on Saturday that the contagion showed that the virus is transmitted like any flu, and that trying to pinpoint a single source for the cases or to establish a link to China were no longer effective containment measures.\n\n\"You can get it from anyone,\" he told reporters. \"We can expect to have cases of patients who had no contact [with suspected carriers].\" He added that while the virus isn't particularly lethal, it can be deadly for the elderly or people with existing conditions.\n\nHowever, the man who died in Veneto had not met the main risk factors for the virus when he was diagnosed with pneumonia two weeks ago. He had not travelled to China, nor come into contact with anyone who had. Therefore he was only tested for the virus after he did not respond to conventional pneumonia treatment, and by then it was too late, according to Francesca Russo, the head of healthcare for the Veneto region.\n\nAlong with eight other infected people, the man who died formed a cluster in his hometown of Vo' Euganeo, population 3,300. Russo expressed relief that to date, none of the hospital personnel who treated the man have tested positive for the virus.\n\nGiulio Gallera, the Lombardy health and welfare ministry chief, also said that the region's casescomprised a traceable cluster, but that officials were still stumped about where it had originated from. The first person to fall ill had met with a man who had returned from China on 21 January, but this man tested negative for the virus and has been ruled out as the source.\n\nOther people had acquired their infections from the 38-year-old, either through contact with him or at the hospital in Codogno where he first received treatment on 18 February.\n\nMore than 250 tests were completed in Lombardy, though hundreds more were being processed, including among the sick man's colleagues at a Unilever plant near Codogno where he worked, Gallera said. \"Given how contagious it is, it's possible the numbers will increase,\" he said.\n\nNational and regional officials approved an ordinance that put 10 Lombardy towns in effective lockdown around Lodi, southeast of Milan, after the region reported a quadrupling of cases on Friday. But individual cities outside the area covered by the ordinance, such as Cremona, issued their own restrictions after confirming there were local cases.\n\nIn Milan itself, however, Milan Fashion Week was wrapping up, though chatter about the rising numbers accompanied the runway shows.\n\n\"It doesn't seem to me in this moment for what regards our sector, our fashion week, that there are signs of danger,'' Carlo Capasa, president of the Italian National Fashion Chamber, told The Associated Press. '\"We are tranquil and prudent.\"\n\nHowever, the world's largest eyewear trade fair, MIDO, announced it was putting off its Milan show until June because of the outbreak, and the postponement of three Serie A football matches has been confirmed.\n\nDespite the alarm, authorities urged calm and tried to balance precautionary closures with the economic reality of regions highly dependent on tourism and commerce. Hotel reservations in Venice were down one-third during the first weekend of Carnival, though the floods in the lagoon city late last year are likely to have scared off visitors.\n\n\"This is not an Italian 'Wuhan',\" insisted Ivana Jlenic, president of the federation of Italian tourism and travel agencies, Fiavet. \"Avoiding all travel at this time would just be alarmist.\"\n\nIn Rome, doctors at the Spallanzani infectious disease hospital treating the first three people in Italy found to be infected with the virus - the Chinese couple from Wuhan and an Italian who contracted the virus in China - reported encouraging news on an otherwise bleak day. The Italian patient who tested positive for the virus two weeks ago was cleared to leave the hospital, while one of the Chinese visitors tested negative for the first time.\n\nSeparately on Saturday, 19 Italians who had spent more than two weeks quarantined on a virus-stricken cruise liner in Japan landed at Rome's military Pratica di Mare airport. They had been stranded on the Diamond Princess since 5 February. Following first health checks and a decontamination process, the passengers were transferred to the military campus of Cecchignola, where they will spend a 14-day isolation period.", "source": {"uri":

hard to stop'", "body": "A 20-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan travelled hundreds of miles to another city where she infected five relatives without showing signs of infection, Chinese scientists have said, offering new evidence that the new coronavirus can be spread asymptomatically.\n\nThe case study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, offered clues about how the coronavirus is spreading, and suggested that it might be difficult to stop.\n\nAccording to the study by Dr Meiyun Wang of the People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University and colleagues, the woman travelled 400 miles (650km) from Wuhan to Anyang in Henan province on 10 January and visited several relatives. When they started getting sick, doctors isolated the woman and tested her for coronavirus. Initially, the young woman tested negative for the virus, but a follow-up test was positive.\n\nAll five of her relatives developed Covid-19 pneumonia, but as of 11 February, the young woman still had not developed any symptoms, her chest CT remained normal and she had no fever, stomach or respiratory symptoms, such as cough or sore throat.\n\nScientists in the study said if the findings are replicated, \"the prevention of Covid-19 infection could prove challenging\".\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's lockdown of millions of people as helping to buy time for the rest of the world to prepare for the new virus.\n\nBut as hot spots emerge around the globe, such as South Korea and Iran, health officials are having difficulty finding and isolating the first source of the virus - the so-called index case. This is fuelling concern that the disease has begun spreading too widely for tried-and-true public health steps to stamp it out.\n\n\"A number of spot fires occurring around the world is a sign that things are ticking along, and what we are going to have here is probably a pandemic,\" said Ian Mackay, who studies viruses at the University of Queensland in Australia.\n\nThe WHO has insisted that Covid-19 is not yet a pandemic and says countries outside China do not yet need more draconian measures. But the spike in cases outside China means the world could be running out of time.\n\n\"What we see is a very different phase of this outbreak depending where you look,\" said WHO's Dr Sylvie Briand. \"We see different patterns of transmission in different places.\"\n\nThe WHO defines a global pandemic as a disease spreading on two continents, though some public health experts would call an outbreak a pandemic if the spread is over a wide area or across many international borders.\n\nDr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University medical centre in Nashville, who was not involved in the Zhengzhou University study, said the Wuhan woman's case provided a \"natural laboratory\" to study Covid-19.\n\n\"Scientists have been asking if you can have this infection and not be ill? The answer is apparently, yes,\" he said.\n\n\"You had this patient from Wuhan where the virus is, traveling to where the virus wasn't,\" he said. \"She remained asymptomatic and infected a bunch of family members and you had a group of physicians who immediately seized on the moment and tested everyone.\"\n\nKey questions now, Schaffner said, are how often does this kind of transmission occur and when during the asymptomatic period does a person test positive for the virus.\n\nReuters and Associated Press contributed to this article.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

soar at 'cult' church", "body": "A 61-year-old woman is believed to have infected dozens of worshippers at the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, taking the national total to 82\n\nThe South Korean city of Daegu was facing an \"unprecedented crisis\" after coronavirus infections that centred on a controversial \"cult\" church surged to 38 cases, accounting for nearly half of the country's total.\n\nThe city of 2.5 million people, which is two hours south of the capital Seoul, was turned into a ghost town after health officials said the bulk of country's 31 new cases announced on Thursday were linked to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.\n\n\"We are in an unprecedented crisis,\" Daegu's mayor, Kwon Young-jin, told reporters.\n\nHe ordered the shutdown of all kindergartens and public libraries, according to the news agency Yonhap. Schools in the city were considering postponing the beginning of the spring term scheduled for early March.\n\nShopping malls and movie theatres were empty and the usually busy city centre streets were quiet. A concert featuring BTS and other K-pop stars that was set for Daegu Stadium on 8 March has been postponed.\n\nThe defence ministry banned troops stationed in Daegu from leaving their barracks and receiving guests. The US military imposed similar restrictions on its army base in the city, which houses thousands of troops, family members and civilian employees, curbing travel and closing schools and child care centres.\n\nIn what the Korean centre for disease control called a \"super spreader\" event, almost half of the country's total of 82 infections have been linked to a 61-year-old woman who worships at the Daegu church, an entity often accused of being a cult.\n\nShe first developed a fever on 10 February but reportedly twice refused to be tested for the coronavirus on the grounds that she had not recently travelled abroad. She attended at least four services before being diagnosed.\n\nSo far, 37 other members of the church have been confirmed as infected.\n\nShincheonji claims that its founder, Lee Man-hee, has donned the mantle of Jesus Christ and will take 144,000 people with him to Heaven, body and soul, on the Day of Judgement.\n\nDaegu's municipal government said there were 1,001 Shincheonji members in the city, all of whom had been asked to self-quarantine, with 90 of them currently showing symptoms.\n\nThose who have symptoms \"will be tested as soon as possible\", Kwon Young-jin said, urging stronger action from the government in Seoul and calling the national response \"inadequate\".\n\n\"We plan to test all believers of that church and have asked them to stay at home isolated from their families.\"\n\nThe situation was \"very grave\", South Korean vice health minister Kim Kang-lip said at a separate briefing.\n\nShincheonji said on Thursday that it had closed down all its facilities nationwide.\n\n\"We are deeply sorry that because of one of our members, who thought of her condition as a cold because she had not travelled abroad, led to many in our church being infected and thereby caused concern to the local community,\" it said in a statement.\n\nAgence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

Only if you're a delusional Trump toady, Mr Pompeo", "body": "The special relationship has ended in tears for Britain, other allies have no reason to trust America, and the world's downtrodden remain at heel\n\nWhen was the last time a British prime minister cancelled a White House summit with a US president? Possibly never. Yet that's what Boris Johnson did after a livid, cursing Donald Trump slammed the phone down on him in a row over the Chinese firm, Huawei.\n\nNow a planned t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate in Washington next month, already twice delayed, is off. Not postponed. Not rescheduled. Off. So much for \"Britain Trump\", the servile moniker the president pinned on Johnson last year. So much for the \"special relationship\". Perhaps it was always doomed to end in tears.\n\nImperious, bullying American behaviour, political arm-twisting and shameless economic blackmail over a post-Brexit trade deal pose big problems for Britain in a time of deep uncertainty. But other US partners are in the same boat.\n\nIf a reminder were needed, it came in the form of Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state and Trump's most influential adviser, who pompously lectured fractious European leaders at last weekend's Munich security conference.\n\nPompeo reassured mutinous allies that, despite unilateralist, isolationist appearances, America remained committed to global leadership. \"The death of the transatlantic alliance is grossly over-exaggerated. The west is winning. We are collectively winning. We're doing it together,\" he declared.\n\nThis is utter hogwash. And almost everyone outside a dishonest, self-deceiving circle of Republican stooges and Trump toadies knows it. Together? In many respects, the US and Europe are further apart than at any time since 1941.\n\nPompeo's speech revealed a cold war mindset that crudely divides the world into friends and foes, separated by walls, missiles, sanctions, insults, and mutually assured dysfunction. For Pompeo, who referenced his formative experience as a soldier patrolling \"freedom's frontier\" in West Berlin in the 1980s, there is no middle way. It's a black-and-white world ruled by fear and force. It's pure regression.\n\nPompeo laid into China over military expansionism, debt diplomacy and cyber threats. Fair enough. But if he wants things to change, he needs to talk calmly. The coronavirus epidemic, like Huawei's controversial G5 networks and Beijing's HS2 bid, shows how inescapably interdependent China and western countries already are. When Jaguar Land Rover runs short of parts, Apple iPhones grow scarce and Lake District B&Bs bemoan missing tourists, all because Hubei is stricken by a virus, it's plain the global die is cast. Whether for security, trade, political, or public health reasons, it's too late to isolate China.\n\nPompeo had it in for Russia and Iran, too - another evil empire, in his telling, that wages \"campaigns of terror in the Middle East and right here in Europe\". Strange, then, that Europeans mostly believe Trump's Iran vendetta to be dangerous and foolish. Stranger still how Trump sucks up to Vladimir Putin.\n\nPompeo's broader theme - that the west, representing freedom and democracy, is winning - is no less daft. Only people with their heads stuck in the self-congratulatory, delusional cloud that frequently envelops Washington could seriously make such a ridiculous claim about the world in 2020.\n\nWhat kind of foggy thinking or wilful blindness allows a senior politician to indulge such complacency when, as he speaks, not so far away, hundreds of thousands of refugees are being mercilessly bombed on Idlib's freezing hillsides?\n\nAlmost 10 years ago, Syrians rose up in search of the freedom and democracy Pompeo lauds. But they got precious little help from the west. The story of the war, in part, is the story of how the west lost Syria, lost other Arab spring countries - and lost credibility everywhere.\n\nOr let's look at nuclear disarmament as the 1970 non-proliferation treaty's (NPT) review conference approaches in April. While the climate emergency dominates the news, nuclear weapons remain the fast-track route to Armageddon. Is non-proliferation a battle the west is winning? Hardly. Trump tore up a key medium-range missile agreement with Russia last year. Now experts fear the 2010 New Start strategic weapons treaty is headed the same way.\n\nContrary to the spirit of the NPT, both the US and Russia are deploying new weapons, including low-yield, tactical warheads that increase the risk of nuclear warfare. Meanwhile, Trump's blundering, hypocritical efforts to force North Korea and Iran to forsake nukes altogether are a bust.\n\nPutin's Russia seizes territory in Ukraine, subverts other people's elections, and assassinates opponents in foreign cities without effective western punishment. The more China's brutal repression of its Muslim minority is documented, the more European governments look away. About this, at least, Pompeo is right.\n\nBut he is dead wrong about Palestine and the Israeli land-grab recently endorsed by Trump. Such blatant theft overturns decades of binding UN resolutions. It makes a mockery of the \"international rules-based order\" - and any semblance of justice. Might these and many other unaddressed crises, including Yemen, Kashmir and Myanmar's ethnically cleansed Rohingyas, reasonably be called \"wins\" for western values? Of course not.\n\nAnd away from conflict zones, new technologies, far from bolstering free societies, deliver ever more pervasive, pernicious means of monitoring, controlling and censoring citizens.\n\nAcross the globe, the battlements of open governance are under attack while its defenders are betrayed from within. Authoritarian regimes are on the up. Intolerant rightwing populists and ultra-nationalist mini-Trumps are on the march.\n\nNo, Mr Pompeo. \"America First\" may work for some in your country. But \"the west\", meaning a multinational, democratic alliance that champions shared principles, aims and laws, is not winning. If this were a movie, it would be called How The West Was Lost - with Trump as outlaw-in-chief.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Hampshire Constabulary has confirmed it is investigating the reports with the force warning: \"Any crime perpetuated through ignorance, prejudice or hate is unacceptable.\"\n\nDr Michael Ng, who is chair of CAS which has around 200 members, told the Guardian that hostility against the Chinese community was at the worst level he had known since he arrived in the UK 24 years ago.\n\n\"It's quite scary when you are walking, as a student, to have people shouting at you, throwing stones at you and you are on your own,\" he said.\n\n\"I have a lot of PhD students from China who when they come here they like to wear masks because it seems to be something quite common in China because of air pollution and other things but now they won't wear masks. It's because of the threat of being abused, of being called a virus.\"\n\nThe incidents reported to the police, first reported by Portsmouth paper, the News, include someone who had stone thrown at them. The student was walking near Primark in Southampton's city centre on 3 February when they were targeted by a man and woman. The dossier says: \"The stone missed ... Offender shouting abuse including the word 'coronavirus' and going back to the fucking country.\"\n\nIn a separate case a day earlier, the dossier records abuse against a female student walking home. \"Unknown male shouting abuse to her and called her fucking virus,\" it reads.\n\nTwo other incidents were recorded on 1 February, including a resident wearing a face mask who was apparently told to leave a public bus in the Portsmouth area by the driver. First Solent and Stagecoach, which run bus services in Portsmouth, said no complaint had so far been received relating to that incident.\n\nIn another case a restaurant worker was harassed while he walked home, according to the dossier which records: \"Unknown white male shouting abuse to him, including the coronavirus and swearing.\"\n\nThe dossier also includes information about a five case, which was not reported to the police, involving Chinese pupils in Portsmouth being shouted at by others in school grounds. The incident prompted the school's head to issue a warning to the entire school about the behaviour.\n\nIt comes after a University of Southampton student tested negative for coronavirus in hospital earlier this month after feeling unwell when they returned from a trip to China. Southampton University's Chinese students and scholars association has created a poster reading, \"I am not a virus, I am a human,\" in a bid to combat discrimination on campus over coronavirus, which has claimed more than 1,800 lives worldwide and infected more than 73,000 people.\n\nLast week a school in the city was evacuated and closed for three days over coronavirus fears sparked by pupils from the same family who came down with symptoms after returning from a country hit by the disease.\n\nA Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said: \"A small number of incidents linked to speculation about coronavirus have been reported to us in Southampton and Portsmouth. Any crime perpetuated through ignorance, prejudice or hate is unacceptable.\"\n\nA University of Southampton spokesperson said: \"The University is extremely concerned by unacceptable comments directed at Chinese students. We have not had any reports of incidents on campus but we do not tolerate any form of racism and would take action as a matter of urgency on any such behaviour.\"", "source": {"uri":

after deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China.\n\nIn some Lombardy and Veneto towns schools, businesses and restaurants have closed. The mayor of Milan, Italy's business capital and the regional capital of Lombardy, shuttered public offices.\n\nA 78-year-old man infected with the coronavirus died in Veneto, and a postmortem test performed on a 77-year-old woman in Lombardy came back positive, although it wasn't clear if illness from the virus caused her death.\n\nLate Saturday, civil protection officials said 79 people had contracted the virus, including the two who died, and one who recovered. Of the remaining 76 people infected, 54 were in Lombardy, 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia-Romagna, two - a Chinese couple from Wuhan - in Lazio, and one in Piedmont.\n\nIt comes amid a growing cluster of cases in the country with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad.\n\nLombardy government authorities said the region's cases were traceable to a 38-year-old Italian who had not travelled to China, but it remained unclear how this man had been infected. Ten towns in Lombardy received orders to suspend nonessential activities and services.\n\nLuca Zaia, the Veneto regional president, said on Saturday that the contagion showed that the virus is transmitted like any flu, and that trying to pinpoint a single source for the cases or to establish a link to China were no longer effective containment measures.\n\nWelcome to this morning's coronavirus live blog. I will be here to give you updates on the latest news throughout the day.\n\nA summary of the news on Sunday:\n\nJapan has confirmed that a woman who tested negative and left the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship later tested positive, raising more questions about the effectiveness of quarantine measures. A dozen towns in northern Italy in effect went into lockdown on Saturday after deaths of two people infected with the coronavirus from China, and a growing cluster of cases with no direct links to the origin of the outbreak abroad. South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, on Sunday put the country on the highest possible alert in its fight against the coronavirus. The measure empowers the government to lock down cities and take other sweeping measures to contain the outbreak. Russia has denied allegations that it is spreading disinformation about the new coronavirus outbreak. US officials said Russian-linked accounts were making unfounded claims on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram through thousands of profiles that the US started the outbreak. Almost a third (31%) of UK consumers will consider avoiding foreign travel if the coronavirus outbreak continues, new research indicates. The consultancy firm Retail Economics, which commissioned the poll of more than 2,000 people, calculated that this could result in \u00a317bn of holiday spending being put on hold. As dozens of evacuees from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship begin their two-week quarantine in the UK, more than 100 others rescued from China are due to be released from isolation.", "source": {"uri":

authorities start to 'round up' patients", "body": "One of Wuhan's most senior doctors has died after contracting coronavirus, as authorities began a sweeping campaign inside the city to seek out patients infected with the deadly virus.\n\n\"Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang hospital, died at 10.30am this morning after resuscitation efforts failed,\" reported the China Central Television's microblog.\n\nConfirmation also emerged of the death of Xu Depu, the former director of the Ezhou city Chinese medicine hospital in Hubei province, from the virus on Thursday last week. A nurse at the hospital on Tuesday confirmed his death, as reported in Red Star news, an outlet under state newspaper Chengdu Commercial Daily.\n\nThe deaths came as state media reported new house-to-house checks in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people at the centre of the outbreak, that aimed to seek out and \"round up\" all infected patients. State media said anyone suspected of having the virus would face mandatory testing and anyone who had close contact with virus patients would be put under quarantine.\n\nResidents who are confirmed to have the virus will be taken to quarantine centres, including hotels.\n\nThe report said all communities and villages would be placed under around-the-clock \"closed-off\" management, in effect putting them under lockdowns.\n\nThe citywide inspection campaign indicates an escalation of the situation in Wuhan, where former officials have been blamed for a cover-up that led to the rapid spread of the virus. Health officials have reported nearly 50,000 confirmed cases in Hubei alone.\n\nThe draconian measures come after two of the city's top leaders were sacked last week. Wuhan's new Communist party chief, Wang Zhonglin, issued the new decree, according to the Global Times, an English-language state newspaper.\n\nOfficials would carry out the inspection with the help of big data and artificial intelligence, it said, without giving details.\n\nAn order on Monday from the Wuhan city legislature on \"winning the coronavirus war\" warned that people who refused mandatory measures such as reporting cases of fever and cough to their local residential committees or going into quarantine if they were sick would be subject to \"coercive measures\".\n\nThe order also said those who delayed reporting cases, or \"fabricate and spread false information on the epidemic\" would be punished.\n\nFootage circulated on the website of the Changjiang Daily, a paper run by Wuhan's Communist party, showing officers in protective clothing knocking on people's doors and checking their temperatures.\n\n\"We're racing with time. This is a heated war of annihilation, not a relaxed protracted war,\" a narrator says. \"It's a painful process but the fight must be fought imminently. The temporary lockdown is for the sake of our reunion in the near future. Wuhan will be bustling again soon.\"\n\nWuhan residents complained about the draconian lockdown on social media. \"We're not allowed to go out at all, we've lost our most basic human rights. The guards are like prison guards, abusing the little bit of power they have. We're guaranteed personal freedoms under the constitution!\" said one in a post on microblogging site Weibo.\n\nAnother social media user also said \"it feels like being in prison\" as she was barred from going out, even going out for a stroll in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe death of whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang, who alerted colleagues over a mysterious disease that turned out to be the coronavirus, this month unleashed an outpouring of anger and grief across the nation. Wuhan police detained and censured him last month for \"spreading false rumours\".\n\nAs in the case of Li's death, there was initial confusion in China about Liu's condition. On Monday night, the Communist party propaganda department of the Hubei Health Commission wrote in a social media post that Liu had died. It then said in a subsequent post that Liu was alive.\n\n\"According to Liu's relative, the hospital is still trying its best to resuscitate him,\" the commission said in the second post, adding that the previous misinformation was from a good friend of Liu who was not aware of the latest situation.\n\nAlthough the number of people contracting coronavirus outside Hubei province has dropped for 13 consecutive days, the situation inside Hubei continues to be serious, reported Global Times.\n\nRestrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from those delivering essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice. The notice also included locking down all residential communities in urban and rural areas, and closing all non-essential public places.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

"What is Covid-19 - the illness that started in Wuhan?\n\nIt is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.\n\nWhat are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?\n\nThe virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.\n\nShould I go to the doctor if I have a cough?\n\nUK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.\n\nIs the virus being transmitted from one person to another?\n\nChina's national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.\n\nHow many people have been affected?\n\nAs of 20 February, China has recorded 2,345 deaths from the Covid-19 outbreak. Health officials have confirmed 76,288 cases in mainland China in total. More than 12,000 have recovered.\n\nThe coronavirus has spread to at least 28 other countries. Japan has 607 cases, including 542 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and has recorded three deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran and the Philippines.\n\nThere have been nine recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK. As of 17 February, a total of 4,501 people have been tested in the UK, of which 4,492 were confirmed negative.\n\nWhy is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?\n\nWe don't yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won't know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2% in the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province, and less than that elsewhere. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.\n\nAnother key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population - elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems - to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.\n\nHave there been other coronaviruses?\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.\n\nIs the outbreak a pandemic?\n\nA pandemic, in WHO terms, is \"the worldwide spread of a disease\". Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO's list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.\n\nShould we panic?\n\nNo. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

warns", "body": "Four Iranians have died after contracting coronavirus, with health authorities warning the virus has spread to multiple cities, while Israel and Lebanon declared their first domestic cases as the deadly epidemic spreads across the Middle East.\n\nAsked on Friday if the new cases put the crisis at a tipping point, the World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the \"window of opportunity is narrowing, so we need to act quickly before it closes completely\".\n\n\"This outbreak could go in any direction,\" Tedros added. \"If we do well, we can avert any serious crisis, but if we squander the opportunity then we will have a serious problem on our hands.\"\n\nIranian health authorities reported two fatalities on Friday, according to Mehr news agency, adding to the two elderly patients who died on Wednesday. A further 14 people tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe outbreak in Iran began in the city of Qom, an often-visited religious destination. The health ministry official Minou Mohrez warned it had since spread to several cities, including the capital, Tehran, according to the official IRNA news agency.\n\n\"It's possible that it exists in all cities in Iran,\" she said, adding the source of the virus was likely a Chinese worker in Qom.\n\nAs the country held a parliamentary election on Friday, state television showed voters in Qom wearing surgical masks. Earlier this week, authorities in Iran closed all schools in Qom as a precaution and called for the suspension of the city's religious gatherings.\n\nThe threat posed is especially concerning in Iran after several years of tightening US sanctions by the Trump administration that have dangerously undermined the domestic health care system. In addition, the sharp devaluation of the Iranian rial makes it extremely unlikely its government would be able to throw the resources at an epidemic as witnessed in China.\n\nTo prevent infections, neighbouring Iraq shut its land crossings with Iran. However, the virus already appears to have leaked out of the country and across international borders.\n\nIn Lebanon, the health minister, Hamad Hassan, reported the country's first case of the virus on Friday, stating the patient was a 45-year-old woman who arrived on Thursday on a flight from Qom.\n\nAt a news conference in Beirut, he said the ministry was also following up on the cases of two other people suspected of contracting Covid-19.\n\nThe new coronavirus, which causes the illness recently named by the WHO as Covid-19, has infected more than 76,000 people in 27 countries and led to more than 2,200 deaths since December.\n\nThere have been only few cases in the Middle East so far. Nine have been confirmed in the United Arab Emirates, seven of whom are Chinese nationals, and one in Egypt.\n\nIn Israel, the health ministry announced the country's first case, saying the patient was an Israeli woman who had been quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.\n\nThe ship was carrying more than 3,700 people in early February, when 10 passengers were diagnosed with Covid-19. Since it was docked and quarantined in the port of Yokohama, a total of 634 passengers and crew have been infected, with two people dying.\n\nEleven Israelis who initially tested negative were flown home by chartered plane overnight on Thursday. However, on arrival, the woman failed a breath sample check, the ministry said, and was immediately moved to a special isolation unit at a hospital near Tel Aviv.\n\nThe repatriation of people from the Diamond Princess, as well, as parts of China and other countries affected by the coronavirus, has caused fears of outbreaks at their return.\n\nIn Ukraine, protestors on Thursday attacked buses carrying 45 Ukrainians and 27 other evacuees from the Chinese province of Wuhan, the virus' centre, to the small town of Novi Sanzhary, fearing they would be a health hazard.\n\nVideos showed dozens of protestors lighting tires ablaze and hurling rocks at the buses carrying the evacuees. Riot police broke up the crowds and detained 24 people.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has planned to quarantine the people at a sanatorium there for two weeks. In an attempt to calm the demonstrators, the health minister, Zoryana Skaletska, pledged to spend the next two in the same sanatorium.\n\nA selfie she posted from her room in quarantine was followed by the hashtags calling on Ukrainians \"not to fear our own\" and \"I am not afraid of the virus, I am with you.\"\n\nAcross the Mediterranean in northern Italy, local authorities announced what they said was the first locally transmitted case. Giulio Gallera, a member of the Lombardy regional government, said the patient fell ill after meeting a friend who had recently returned from China and was now in intensive care.\n\n\"We have introduced a compulsory quarantine for all those who have been in contact with the patients who tested positive,\" the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said, adding that anyone who had been in \"areas of risk\" over the past two weeks should stay at home.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_holmes@theguardian.com",

"Covid-19 not as deadly as Sars, figures show, and children not affected in same way as adults\n\nCovid-19, the new coronavirus that has killed nearly 1,800 people in China, causes only mild disease in four out of five people who get it, the World Health Organization has said.\n\n\"It appears that Covid-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses, including Sars and Mers,\" said the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding that officials were \"starting to get a clearer picture of the outbreak\".\n\nThe conclusion comes from analysis of data from Chinese authorities relating to 44,000 cases of Covid-19 in Hubei province, where the coronavirus was first recorded.\n\n\"More than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover, 14% have severe disease including pneumonia and shortness of breath, 5% have critical disease including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure, and 2% of cases are fatal,\" Tedros said in Geneva. \"The risk of death increases the older you are.\"\n\nHe said children were not suffering from Covid-19 in the same way as adults, and more research was needed to find out why. There were still gaps in understanding that he hoped the WHO's team of international experts would be able to work towards filling.\n\nChina has reported 70,365 cases of Covid-19 infection, 2,051 of those in the last 24 hours. The new cases include those confirmed by lab tests and those diagnosed through lung CT scans read by doctors. The vast majority of Chinese cases - 94% - continue to be reported in Hubei province. China says there have been 1,772 deaths. Outside China, there have been 694 cases and four deaths.\n\nTedros said there appeared to be a decline in the number of new cases in China. \"This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change.\" He said the WHO would continue to work day and night to help countries prepare for the potential arrival of the coronavirus, sending testing kits and protective equipment, working with manufacturers to ensure supplies are maintained, and training health workers.\n\nHe thanked countries that had contributed towards the $675m that the WHO has said it needs to fight the epidemic, but he added: \"We have not seen the urgency in the funding that we need. We have a window of opportunity now. We need resources now to ensure countries are prepared now. We don't know how long this window of opportunity will remain.\"\n\nThe WHO's director of emergencies, Dr Michael Ryan, said the outbreak should not be described as a pandemic, even though it has spread to 25 countries outside China. \"The real issue is whether we are seeing efficient community transmission outside of China and at the present time we are not observing that,\" he said.\n\nDr Sylvie Briand, the director of pandemic and epidemic diseases at the WHO, said the organisation was working closely\" with Japanese authorities regarding the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off the coast of Japan.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we focus on our objective, our public health objective, which is to contain the virus, and not to contain the people, and making sure that we can have the right balance between the health of the population in Japan and other countries, but also the health of the people being currently on this boat,\" she said.\n\nThere were still many unknowns, she said. \"Measures are implemented and assessed currently and monitored on a nearly hourly basis, because we learn every day and every hour more about this disease and this virus.\"\n\nMeanwhile, experts said reports that some people may have incubated the virus for far longer than the 14-day quarantine period before falling ill were likely to be anomalies.\n\nThe China-based Global Times tweeted that one person had been diagnosed 34 days after being in Wuhan and another 94 days after contact with someone who lived in Wuhan.\n\nDr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University, said: \"The last data I saw suggested 95% of people had incubation of less than 12 days. There will be the outlier, the occasional person who has a longer incubation period.\" But 34 days and 94 days were extremely unlikely, he said. \"Those people will have had another more recent exposure.\"\n\nHe added: \"Incubation period is based on best possible evidence. We are learning and gaining new data all the time so [it is] entirely possible it may be revised as the outbreak carries on.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

disease.\n\nAll highways and railways were closed at the border between Turkey and Iran as of 5pm local time and flights from Iran suspended, the Turkish health minister, Fahrettin Koca, said on Sunday. Flights from Turkey to Iran are still allowed.\n\nA provincial official in Pakistan and the country's Frontier Corps also confirmed that the country had sealed the land border with Iran.\n\nParts of Iran face lockdown as part of Iranian attempts to control the spread of Covid-19, which has killed eight people in Iran.\n\n\"If the situation gets any worse city staff will be expected to convert to teleworkers,\" said the mayor of Tehran, Pirouz Hanachi.\n\nThe Iranian authorities have also been fighting an information war amid widespread distrust on social media about whether the public is being told the truth about the scale of the outbreak.\n\nIran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claimed Tehran's enemies were spreading mistrust and blamed western scare stories for the low turnout in parliamentary elections on Friday.\n\nThe first confirmed death from the virus in the Middle East was reported last Wednesday in the city of Qom, about an hour's drive from Tehran.\n\nThe number of people on the streets of the capital has been noticeably lower, with many shops shut and face masks in short supply and increasingly expensive.\n\nThe authorities have introduced increasingly drastic measures in Tehran and 13 provinces, including the closure of schools, universities, cinemas and theatres. Public buses in Tehran have been disinfected, and posters put up urging people to clean their hands and not shake those of others.\n\nOn Sunday, the city's school system has been shut for a minimum of two days to allow for disinfection spraying. There was also widespread advice to stay home and avoid places where people congregate. Some football matches were cancelled. Metro stations were not shut, but water fountains and shops were all being closed. The council said it was also taking new steps to dispose of waste.\n\nAt the airport, roughly a third of passengers were wearing masks, but there were no special controls on people leaving the country. Turkey, Iraq and Pakistan have either closed borders or are imposing extra health checks.\n\nDespite the precautions the vast majority were carrying on daily lives as normal.\n\nSome of the families of those that have died in Qom claim to know of no contact with anyone in China, prompting claims that this may be an indigenous disease. The health minister Saeed Saltaki denied this, saying one victim traded in China and had travelled there indirectly. The strain discovered in Iran matched that in China, he said.\n\nSaltaki has recommended no travel to or from Qom, as well as promising to distribute free coronavirus packages to residents in the area, including masks and educational brochures.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_wintour@theguardian.com", "name":

"body": "Officials and state justice chief fired as at least 500 cases confirmed in prisons in three provinces\n\nA 29-year-old doctor in Wuhan has become the latest victim of the coronavirus as China reported infections in prisons in three provinces, as well as clusters in Beijing.\n\nWuhan health authorities said Peng Yinhua, who worked in respiratory and critical care at Jiangxia district's First People's Hospital, had contracted the infection while working on the \"front line\".\n\nPeng, who had been featured in state media previously for delaying his wedding to continue working, was admitted to hospital on 25 January. His condition dramatically worsened by 30 January, when he was sent to the Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan for emergency treatment. He died on Thursday at 9.50pm, according to a statement from his hospital.\n\nHis death came as China reported an increase in new cases of coronavirus, with 1,109 new confirmed infections, compared with 394 the day before, bringing the total number of cases in mainland China to 74,685. The death toll has now reached 2,236, with 118 new deaths as of the end of Thursday.\n\nIt has also emerged more than 500 cases have been confirmed in prisons across China.\n\nOn Friday, Hubei province revised its number of newly confirmed cases to add 220 infections from the province's prison system. Officials did not say when those infections took place but said that a total of 271 cases, of which 51 had already been counted, had been diagnosed. Of those, 230 were in Wuhan's women's prison. The head of the women's prison has been dismissed.\n\nIn Rencheng prison in the eastern province of Shandong, 200 prisoners and seven guards tested positive as of Thursday, after infections among correctional officers were first detected last week.\n\nAt Shilifeng prison in the southern province of Zhejiang, a total of 34 prisoners have been confirmed to have contracted the virus, including 27 new cases as of Thursday. According to state media, two prison officials have been fired over the incident in Shilifeng. In Shandong, seven prison officials as well as the party secretary for the province's department of justice have been removed.\n\nOfficials said 2,077 people in Rencheng prison had now been tested. Authorities said they were setting up a specialist hospital and sending inspection teams to other prisons and detention centres.\n\nMeanwhile in Beijing, 36 people at Fuxing hospital have tested positive for the virus, prompting renewed anxiety about the virus as residents in the capital were slowly returning to work. The hospital had already been partly under lockdown after cases there were confirmed earlier this month.\n\nAt another hospital, Peking University People's Hospital, three people were confirmed to have contracted the virus, according to state media. The three patients are family members. One had been hospitalised for kidney problems and may have contracted the illness when her daughter and son-in-law, who had recently travelled to Xinjiang, visited her in hospital.\n\nAs infections outside China increase, the World Health Organization warned that countries were not treating the virus as \"public enemy number one\".\n\n\"If we don't hit hard now using the window of opportunity, we might be faced with a serious problem,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday. \"This virus is very dangerous and it's public enemy number one and it's not being treated as such.\"\n\nIn South Korea, prime minister Chung Se-kyun said the country was entering an emergency phase following a surge in infections that has been linked to a controversial church.\n\nMass gatherings have been banned, and all kindergartens and libraries closed in Daegu, a city that is home to 2.5 million people and lies two hours from Seoul. Soldiers in the city have also been forbidden from leaving their barracks after several military personnel tested positive.\n\nA further 52 new cases were reported by officials on Friday, bringing the national total of confirmed patients to 156. Most are concentrated in Daegu, where a wave of infections have been linked to a 61-year-old woman, known as \"Patient 31\". The patient is reported to have attended a church, an incident health officials have described as a \"super-spreading event\".\n\nMore than 400 members of the church, a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which is often accused of being a cult, are showing symptoms of the disease. Tests were still ongoing, according to the city's mayor, Kwon Young-jin.\n\nOn Friday, the city's streets were mostly deserted, as people were urged to stay at home and wear masks, even indoors. Military medical staff are also being deployed to Daegu and neighbouring Cheongdo county, and isolation facilities are being created.\n\n\"It's like someone dropped a bomb in the middle of the city,\" resident Kim Geun-woo, 28, told Reuters by telephone. \"It looks like a zombie apocalypse.\"\n\nPrime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said that while previous efforts had been focused on stopping the illness entering the country, officials were now concentrating on preventing the illness from spreading further in communities.\n\n\"It is urgent to find those who were in contact with the infected and treat the diagnosed people as soon as possible,\" Chung said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lillian Yang.

coronavirus crisis", "body": "Detention of prominent scholar Xu Zhiyong comes amid wider crackdown on freedom of speech\n\nThe Chinese authorities have detained a prominent activist and legal scholar who issued a blistering attack on president Xi Jinping for mishandling the coronavirus crisis amid a nationwide crackdown on speech freedom.\n\nXu Zhiyong, a former law lecturer and founder of the social campaign New Citizens Movement, was taken away by police on Saturday evening while he was seeking refuge at the home of a lawyer in the southern city of Guangzhou, activists Ye Du and Hua Ze said.\n\nHis host Yang Bin, her husband and son were also taken away for \"hiding criminals\" but were released after 24 hours, they said. Yang has reportedly posted comments online demanding officials be held responsible for the whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang who died this month.\n\nA staff member who answered the phone at the Shilou township Public Security Bureau in Guangzhou refused to comment.\n\nXu published an essay early this month, which called on China's president to resign for his lack of ability to govern China, citing the coronavirus crisis and the mishandling of the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests - a dangerous move that guarantees official anger.\n\n\"You didn't authorise the truth to be released, and the outbreak turned into a national disaster,\" Xu wrote.\n\n\"Whenever you face looming crisis, you're clueless,\" Xu wrote. \"I don't think you're an evil man, you're just not wise ... Mr Xi Jinping, please step down.\"\n\nXu's friends said he had been on the run since December, after the authorities cracked down on a secret meeting attended by more than 20 rights lawyers and activists in the southeastern city of Xiamen in Fujian province. More than 10 participants have been summoned or detained mostly on subversion charges since.\n\nXu's detention is likely to end in a lengthy jail term, because he has previously been jailed and the authorities tend to punish repeated offenders harshly.\n\n\"We're very pessimistic, it certainly won't be a light sentence in view of the current situation,\" his friend and fellow activist Hua Ze said.\n\nXu's detention came amid a nationwide crackdown on freedom of speech amid the coronavirus crisis. The death of whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang, who was silenced by police after warning colleagues about the coronavirus, sparked public outrage. Law professor Xu Zhangrun, who also published a public critique of Xi, was placed under house arrest for days and now barred from the internet. At least two citizen journalists are reportedly detained.\n\nActivists say the authorities are using the coronavirus epidemic as an opportunity to intensify their crackdown on dissent.\n\n\"Whenever there is a political challenge, they would step up on suppression,\" said Dr Teng Biao, Xu's long term fellow activist.\n\nXu, started his activism in 2003 when he and fellow PhD graduates, Teng and another friend, urged the national legislature to scrap rules on detaining and repatriating migrants. A champion for social equality and the rule of law as part of his New Citizens Movement, he was jailed in January 2014 for four years after writing an open letter critical of Xi and for staging protests for equal rights for migrant children and official transparency over private assets.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

traditional fishers as rock lobster market hits rock bottom", "body": "China's ban on live seafood imports has taken a huge toll on island communities at a time when crayfish are at their most bountiful\n\nJanuary and February are usually the busiest time of year for longtime Torres Strait fisherman Boggo Billy.\n\nOrdinarily, just before dawn or dusk, he would navigate out in a dinghy from his home on Warraber, a 37-hectare island between the top of Cape York and the southern coast of Papua New Guinea, which is home to around 250 people.\n\nThe reefs around the island teem with life: b\u00eache-de-mer (sea cucumbers), dugongs, crabs and tropical rock lobsters that are usually worth around $70 a kilogram from middlemen supplying fish markets in China.\n\nBilly's local knowledge, inherited from generations before him, means he knows when \"the good tides\" will roll in and what they mean for the crustaceans, which leaves him perfectly poised to capitalise on the boom brought on by lunar new year.\n\nBut this year the boom was a bust. Live crayfish prices plummeted after the outbreak of coronavirus in December. China cancelled many lunar new year celebrations and banned the import of live seafood.\n\nOn the Torres Strait, rock lobsters are the region's second-most valuable fishery and a vital source of income for people in small island communities.\n\nNow, Billy says, \"you've got to try and get many more crayfish to make $1,000\".\n\nRather than increasing the size of their catch, which could cause problems in the heavily regulated industry, most fishermen have chosen to stay ashore.\n\n\"Most of the fishermen have stopped going out now, because it seems like you can't make any money because of what's going on,\" he says.\n\nJames Billy, another Warraber fisherman and a distant relation of Boggo Billy, sells his own catch plus fish he buys from other islanders to a Chinese buyer with a factory in Cairns.\n\nJames Billy says prices for live crayfish have plummeted to $25 per kilogram, which means that after spending on fuel and equipment, it's difficult to turn a profit.\n\nAs well as freediving in the shallower waters, James Billy also hookah dives. The method uses surface-supplied air to keep fishermen in deeper water for longer and is preferred by traditional fishers who hold traditional inhabitant business licenses.\n\nA day of hookah diving for lobster, James estimates, would mean a catch of 40kg to 50kg of crayfish and a profit of around $2,000 dollars in a strong market.\n\nFor those who just freedive, the timing of the virus is especially bad because January and February are the months when the crayfish are most bountiful in shallow waters.\n\n\"This is usually a time to load up and sell lots of crayfish,\" James Billy says.\n\nBoggo and James Billy both have day jobs which mean they can support their families despite the crash. But they say the huge loss of income from fisheries, and the uncertainty about when the market might return are a major cause of stress for the community.\n\nThe situation isn't helped by the already inflated prices families have to pay for food on Warraber.\n\n\"We're really worried. We've got families to support, kids down mainland for school,\" Billy says. \"We'll cross our fingers.\"\n\nIndustry administrators and fishermen met to consider changes to the sea cucumber fishery as possible stop-gap measures, including lifting restrictions on other fisheries and allowable restrictions.\n\nJames Billy says some fishermen on Warraber, and its sister island, Poruma, have already transitioned to catching lollyfish, a variety of sea cucumber that is abundant around both islands.\n\nHe says it sells for about $10 per kilogram, a low price, but one that has still helped some locals to \"keep their heads above water\".\n\nBut the fact sea cucumbers are easy to catch makes them particularly prone to overfishing. That means regulations can only be loosened to a point to help those who are struggling - a free-for-all isn't possible because it would jeopardise the long-term sustainability of different sea cucumber species.\n\nThe latest shock to the local industry comes on the back of other hits as the impacts of global heating begin to be felt acutely in these waters.\n\n\"In 2017, we had that [coral] bleaching. It affected not so much the price, but the crayfish. We, across the Torres Strait, we were all catching little crayfish,\" James Billy says. \"It was warm water from the surface like six metres down.\"\n\nJames Billy says there were also problems with the health of the crayfish, with many dying after being caught.\n\nThe latest crash, Boggo Billy says, is frustrating, but he's got his fingers crossed that the market will be \"back on\" soon, so \"everybody will be smiling again\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_banister@theguardian.com", "name": "Jack Banister",

- restaurant review | Jay Rayner", "body": "Chinese restaurants need your custom - no hard thing to give when the food is this good\n\nFour Seasons, 12 Gerrard Street, London W1D 5PR (020 7494 0870). Starters \u00a33.20-\u00a312.80, roast duck portion \u00a311.40, half \u00a314.40, mains \u00a39.30-\u00a320.50, wines from \u00a317.80, beers \u00a34.50\n\nIt's after dinner that we really notice it. London's Gerrard Street on a Saturday night is usually the restaurant equivalent of a mosh pit: a heaving crowd of hungry people, the scent of scorched wok in their nostrils, and the reflection of the bronzed and shiny roast ducks that crowd the windows of Chinatown's main drag in their eyeballs. Tonight, there was a pre-cinema rush, which we got caught up in. But now it's gone 9pm. The pedestrianised street is sparsely populated and through the picture windows, chairs and tables sit forlorn and empty. I've never seen it like this before.\n\nAfter the Chinese New Year at the end of January, as news of the emerging coronavirus spread, \"business just went down,\" says Jackie, duty manager of the Four Seasons at No 12, her hand making a swooping gesture like a plane crashing to ground. \"We want the business back but we can't do anything about it,\" she says, with a sad shrug. \"People are scared.\" Because a nasty virus has broken out in a city 5,500 miles away from London, Britain's Chinese community is suffering. Because, y'know, Chinese people. There are reports of abuse on the streets, of Asians being shunned on public transport. Across the Chinese restaurant sector, business is down. The mother of one Anglo-Chinese friend calls it \"health-linked racial discrimination\". It doesn't matter what excuse you choose for your racism. It's still racism.\n\nSo this is a review with a simple message: go and support your local Chinese restaurant. Go show them that ethnicity is not a marker for disease. I didn't need to go to the branch of the Four Seasons at 12 Gerrard Street to write about it. I eat there alone about once a month, taking a yellow-clothed table in the corner of one of the plain dining rooms. It's often before going to record an episode of the Kitchen Cabinet for Radio 4, when having a good lunch is a grand idea: a plate of Cantonese roast meats of one sort or another, something green, a magazine to read. The food speaks directly to an intense, needy part of my appetite. I also like the brisk and efficient staff who greet me like a total stranger every time, despite the fact I've been going for years. I've mentioned it on this page and elsewhere before.\n\nSo no, I really didn't need to go again. I know what they do and how well they do it. But this is an act of solidarity that also gets me roast duck. I was introduced to this Four Seasons by chef and writer Simon Hopkinson. He once told me the Chinese are the best at roasting ducks and that this is one of the best places for the best. I say this one, because it's a group, which started over on London's Queensway. There are now half a dozen, including one in Leicester and one literally next door, which specialises in hot pots. But I have my loyalties.\n\nSometimes I have the cubed belly pork. It has crackled skin like glass that shatters beneath the teeth, giving way to the soft layer of ivory-coloured fat underneath and then, below that, the meat. Tonight, though, we start with the char siu. It is not a worrying shade of traffic light red, as it sometimes can be, and nor is it dry, or too thinly sliced. It's just a deep, reddy brown, and in pleasing thumb-thick pieces and is eye-rollingly savoury. It comes on a heap of Chinese cabbage with the obligatory moat of dark, sweet-savoury liquor, which could be sipped neat as a restorative. Sometimes, when I am by myself and I'm convinced nobody is looking, I do just that, lifting the bowl to my lips as if it were a teacup. My motto: \"No spoonful left behind.\"\n\nAnd then the roast duck - the skin dark lacquered, most of the fat rendered, the meat soft and sensuous to the tongue as if braised. Crispy duck with pancakes is the boisterous crowd-pleaser, and has its place. Deep orange Peking duck, with its caramel-crunchy skin slicing rituals and its two services, is the fancy Bond Street version. Peking duck can be exhausting, like some high maintenance pretty friend who constantly needs to be told how beautiful they are.\n\nThis roast duck is the one I prefer: it doesn't need to be wrapped up in pancakes. It doesn't need hoisin or plum sauce or vegetables shredded within an inch of their life. It's self-contained and self-assured. Usually I get it bone in, because I like its tactile nature. Tonight, though, for ease of management with a sizable group, we have it boneless. Most of my party hasn't tried it this way before. I get to nod at them in a self-satisfied manner and mouth the words \"I know\" as they coo and mutter.\n\nNext the greens. For a long while it was the dry-fried green beans with minced pork and chilli. Then I discovered they did something similar with a big old tangle of morning glory. It comes in a thick pot, much like a classic mortar, which is so searingly hot they have to serve it inside a second container to spare the table. This means that when you're done with the vegetables, a ballast of minced pork and chilli has continued cooking and crusted around the bottom. It is illegal to not scrape this up. Beware: the metal spoon gets finger-burning hot from the bowl.\n\nWe have big curls of salt and pepper squid in a fine, lacy batter and, because I'm feeling adventurous, lamb with ginger in a dark, sticky Peking sauce. We drink jasmine tea and a few Tsing Tao beers and run up a bill of \u00a3130 for four. There are wines, which I know from experience to be less than fabulous, but then why would you? We do not even investigate dessert. Just outside the door are waffle shops and Chinese patisseries.\n\nUntil about 15 years ago, London's Chinatown was a sad place. You didn't go there to eat well. But the opening up of China has brought us the country's thrilling variety from Sichuan to Shanghai, from Hunan to Xinjiang and back again. It's happening all over. Walking from Birmingham New Street station recently, I was staggered to see that the once mainly Cantonese Chinatown has grown from a tiny cluster to a vast district apparently representing all the provinces. Britain's Chinese restaurant offering is more diverse and exciting than it's ever been. Please go and eat in one. Now.\n\nTime to name check a few other Chinese favourites. In Blackpool there's the Wok Inn Seaside Noodle Bar, both for pan-Asian dishes and Cantonese classics (and it's mothership deeper into town, Mandarin). In Manchester go to Live Seafood, for crustacea from the tanks cooked all ways. In Edinburgh visit Chop Chop for seriously compelling dumplings. And elsewhere in London's Chinatown, try Baiwei for bare bones Sichuan or JinLi just around the corner for similar food in plusher surroundings. Dumpling's Legend is the place for Xiao Long Bao (or soupy dumplings), and just across Shaftesbury Avenue there's the ever-brilliant Y Ming.\n\nIs it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a 'premium immersive restaurant experience' based on the characters from the DC Comics universe, including Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman et al. What this means in terms of the actual food is anybody's guess, but it will occupy an 18,000 square foot basement site on London's Brewer Street.\n\nJamie Oliver continues to rebuild his restaurant interests, despite the closure of so many UK outlets last year when the Jamie's Italian group failed, resulting in mass redundancies. Chequer Lane will open in Dublin in April and will promote 'the best of Irish produce'.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We'll bring you more on this story as soon as we have it.\n\nMore than 620 of the passengers on the Diamond Princess liner have been infected on the ship, which has been quarantined since 3 February, initially with about 3,700 people on board.\n\nNationals from Australia, the US, Canada and Hong Kong who have been quarantined on the ship have been airlifted home.\n\nHello and welcome to the Guardian's live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHere's an update of what we know so far.\n\nTwo people infected with Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise liner, have died, reports say. Hong Kong citizens evacuated from the Diamond princess have begun arriving home. New cases in China have fallen to 394 according to the daily national update, taking cases across the country to 74,576. Total deaths have risen by 114 to 2,118. Figures across China for new cases have dropped significantly after Hubei province changed the way it counted cases again, to remove the clinically diagnosed cases who have since tested negative to the virus on the test kit.\n\nYou can get up to date on our latest coverage below, including:\n\nCoronavirus 'could cost global economy $1.1tn in lost income' China to expel WSJ journalists over

day-to-day life", "body": "The coronavirus is a public health emergency, but its threat is not only medical. Millions of lives have been altered by the outbreak, from those in self-isolation in China to Chinese nationals experiencing racism abroad. We talk to those affected in different ways by the outbreak, from Wuhan to the north of England.\n\nWuhan\n\nWi, a 29-year-old Chinese PhD student in the Midlands, is originally from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak and where her parents have been in self-quarantine for more than 20 days. \"They can't walk, they can't leave their own flat - it's not a holiday, it's like jail,\" she said. \"They are unable to even open windows for fear that the virus will spread through the air.\n\n\"Now the whole of Wuhan is closed, all public transport and private cars have been stopped, so they can't even drive their own cars on the road. So they just stay at home, eating, sleeping and watching movies. That's all they can do,\" Wi said.\n\nWi's parents have not been told when they'll be allowed to leave their flat. Wi has become concerned about the mental health of those in isolation in the city, after seeing posts on social media with locals saying they would rather commit suicide than remain in quarantine any longer.\n\n\"The biggest enemy is not the virus, it's mental health. When you stay in one room for half a month, that's horrible, you cannot go outside or get fresh air.\"\n\nHubei province\n\nA hundred miles from Wuhan, nestled in the countryside of Hubei province, British teacher Claude* is in self-isolation with his Chinese girlfriend and her family in her hometown, which the pair were visiting for the lunar new year.\n\n\"After a day or two, it became a ghost town,\" Claude, 46, said. \"The first week I was just relaxing - I work near Hong Kong so this was my holiday. I thought I would have more cabin fever by now, but I'm actually pretty fine. My girlfriends's family are cooking lots and cleaning for us, so I'm being spoilt,\" he said.\n\nHe described the town as \"post-apocalyptic\", with speakers playing American swing music on empty streets, and men in biohazard suits checking people's temperatures before they enter Walmart. He and his girlfriend still do not know when they will be allowed to leave. But when they finally return to their home in Shenzhen, they will be required to undergo another two weeks in quarantine.\n\nClaude said the mood in the town was \"pretty chilled out\", but feared this could change in coming weeks as supplies run low. \"As the days go on, more people are wearing masks, and people are standing further and further apart,\" he said.\n\nHunan province\n\nIn neighbouring Hunan province, Yuhan, a 28-year-old Chinese national who lives and works in Melbourne, is also trapped, after returning to visit her family for the new year.\n\nShe has now been in self-quarantine with her parents for 29 days, leaving only to visit her grandmother who lives 200 metres away. Yuhan worries that the isolation could last another two weeks.\n\nThe family order groceries online once every two or three days, and spend most of their time cooking and watching TV. They usually go to her grandmother's for lunch and leave food for her dinner. But Yuhan said many of her friends' families would not leave the house at all.\n\n\"My grandma keeps wanting to go out for walks, especially when it's sunny, but I always try to stop her and walk around the apartment with her,\" she said. \"It is sometimes hard to explain to my grandma how dangerous things still are, as official news on TV is mainly good news.\"\n\nShanghai\n\nIn the country's most populous city, Shanghai, many foreign teachers are beginning to fear for their jobs.\n\nRob, a 23-year-old teacher at an international kindergarten in the city, said about 25 other teachers had lost their jobs during the outbreak, after parents refused to send their children back to school for their final term. This has left the teachers with just 30 days to find work before their visas expire.\n\n\"The worrying thing is that once these teachers have their work visas cancelled, their medical insurance goes too,\" he said. \"The school has said they can't do anything - they need to lay them off because the profit margins are too tight, and it's illegal not to cancel their visas if they're not working.\"\n\nRob could not fly home to the UK as planned, so instead flew out to Bangkok. Now back in Shanghai, he told of people being charged \u00a36 for face masks, and others having to go without if they missed the daily registration for them. He had also been warned of landlords taking their tenant's allocation of masks, claiming that as homeowners, the masks given to each household should go to them.\n\nEn route to the UK\n\nSome people who have travelled through China have criticised airline checks designed to prevent the spread of the virus. Dave* was on holiday in Bangkok with his partner and travelled back to the UK via Beijing with Air China, wearing face masks and swimming goggles.\n\nAirline staff took the temperatures of passengers at Bangkok, where four people \"blatantly tested far above the threshold\" but were allowed to board after short arguments with flight attendants, said the 39-year-old.\n\n\"My partner and I both thought the flight was tense, and the flight crew were visibly nervous on both sides. Some people didn't seem too fussed about it, and I got the impression that a lot of people were half-hearted, like wearing masks that weren't properly over their face.\"\n\nAt Heathrow, there were no checks or information. \"It was just like flying to Heathrow on any other day,\" he said. \"I was expecting at least some information on contacting Public Health England, but there weren't even any posters. Us and a litany of sick coughing people from an Air China flight waltzed right out the airport.\"\n\n\"There was hand sanitiser everywhere but no one seemed to use it,\" he added. \"I felt it was all a bit half-arsed.\"\n\nIn the UK\n\nBack in the UK, the Chinese community are feeling the effects of the virus. Lee*, a Chinese PhD student in the north of England, was subjected to racist abuse on a night out because of the coronavirus. He said he and two Chinese friends were on their way to a shopping centre one evening when three men in a car began shouting at them. \"They called us 'Chinese virus' and 'you Chinese bastards',\" Lee said.\n\n\"We were really afraid. We passed them quickly and we kept silent because we were scared they might do something violent. There was nobody else out on the street and we wanted to stay safe. It felt very dangerous at the time.\"\n\nLee said that since the incident he has stayed at home more, only going out for university meetings or shopping for food. He feels that since the outbreak cultural differences are causing issues. The British do not tend to wear face masks but it is normal for Asian people, he said. \"Now my Chinese friends get stared at for wearing them.\"\n\n*Some names have been changed.", "source": {"uri":

of modern medicine | Ranjana Srivastava", "body": "\"Here, I'll put him on the phone,\" says my exhausted friend before I can beg off. He is in hospital with a serious illness and I have taken pains to be her friend and not his doctor, but after two long weeks she doesn't care for boundaries.\n\nTo him, I say the most obvious thing: \"You sound like you're in pain.\"\n\n\"No one can help me.\"\n\nAt this, my hackles rise. With a mix of friendly concern and professional knowledge and wanting to say just enough but not too much, I urge: \"You must speak up.\"\n\nThere's a pause. \"And who would I tell?\"\n\n\"Your doctor,\" I say, resisting a tone of exasperation and then feeling immediately relieved when he innocently asks: \"And can you tell me who that would be?\"\n\nAnd then it dawns on me. His three tubes, a nasogastric, a drain, and a urinary catheter are managed by three different surgeons. The infectious diseases physician is running the antibiotics. The nephrologist is juggling the fluid balance. The rehab physician says it's not yet time for rehab. Six specialists visit the man and yet he is looking for a doctor.\n\nThe spread of super-specialisation at the cost of whole-patient welfare is an alarming problem of modern medicine. Doctors are required to define a scope of practice, which is broadly linked to a field of expertise. For instance, an oncologist cannot deliver babies, or a surgeon administer chemotherapy. A general practitioner must refer out for a gastroscopy and a radiologist may not provide a clinical prognosis. These restrictions protect patients from exuberant and overly confident doctors of all kinds who might think there is nothing special about specialisation.\n\nMany years of training in a speciality has its obvious benefits, which is why people turn to an ankle surgeon, an asthma specialist or a dementia expert. At the same time, there is nothing about any scope of practice that precludes doctors from assessing the whole patient and making a decision based on a thorough history and examination and a sound understanding of physiology and pharmacology - something all doctors learnt in medical school.\n\nSo why is it that the modern physician prefers to manage just one organ and a surgeon wants to operate on one type of bone? Why is it that the narrower the speciality the greater the prestige when the average patient with multiple chronic conditions desperately needs someone to heed the big picture? And what happens to all those nurses, residents and trainees who find themselves caught on the horns of a dilemma - whether to blindly follow a subspecialist's lead and treat the organ in isolation or listen to their instincts and care for the human being? I am afraid it has become increasingly challenging to do the latter.\n\nOnce, clinicians were more willing to have robust discussions with each other about all sorts of issues from diagnosis and management to end of life care. Curiosity, broad knowledge, and an interest in ideas beyond one's specialty were considered a mark of maturity and wisdom. I will never forget a gastrointestinal surgeon giving a lucid lecture on the pathophysiology of renal failure that wowed my whole class. Or the intensive care physician who educated a patient about all the complications of cardiac surgery in front of the surgeon who said he couldn't have put it better. Or the urologist who told a relieved woman that based on her history and where she hailed from, he was certain that the mass in her bladder represented not cancer but tuberculosis, a curable condition. Today, each of these doctors might be considered overreaching. There is a quaint term for doctors who look beyond one problem: \"old-fashioned\".\n\nBut how did this happen? A reasonable explanation is that medical knowledge is bursting at the seams and it is impossible to keep up. If one can barely remember the indication for 20 new cancer drugs, what incentive is there to know about the newest insulin? If I am never going to perform a hip replacement myself, why should I bother discussing it at all?\n\nBut another explanation is that in defending their own expertise, doctors have managed to devalue each other. When my GP friend called obstetrics, the response began with: \"Why are you managing this pregnancy?\", requiring a seasoned GP to explain to a trainee that she had a diploma in obstetrics. A senior radiologist who asked reasonable questions to prevent unnecessary imaging was chided for pretending to be a bedside clinician. A young surgeon interested in end of life care was dismissively told to leave it to the experts.\n\nOpining from our silos, when we began ribbing our colleagues, \"What would you know about this?\", we didn't realise that eventually we would reach a point where doctors would begin to doubt our own capabilities and say: \"What would I know about this?\"\n\nConsequently, invaluable technical crafts such as repairing a fracture or inserting a stent have become conflated with the greater mission of medicine, which is to serve the whole patient. But in relegating ourselves to the role of technicians in service of an organ, we diminish the capacity of intelligent and well-educated doctors to hold more than view, be interested in more than one aspect of the body and contemplate the welfare of all of society which includes the patients we will never see. Patients yearn for the able generalist, yet we reward the niche specialist.\n\nI have been thinking about the role of broad intellectual curiosity in the context of the coronavirus outbreak and the widespread remorse for the plight of the young Chinese doctor who was the first to raise the alarm about a cluster of infected patients. It is now well known that he was humiliated by the authorities and forced to withdraw the \"rumour\" but what is less well appreciated is that Dr Li Wenliang was an ophthalmologist.\n\nWhat would an ophthalmologist know about a virus? Indeed, he could be forgiven for both knowing nothing and saying nothing. But as it turns out, he had the vanishing quality of realising that he had come across a problem he couldn't ignore even if it had nothing to do with the cataracts and glaucoma he was paid to treat. Deigning to cross another's turf: in the ever-narrowing corridors of modern medicine, this would be a brave move anywhere. In China, it could have permanent consequences.\n\nLi contracted the virus from an elderly glaucoma patient. He lived to witness the unimaginable impact of his courageous call but tragically not long enough to see the birth of his second child. At age 34, he had achieved that rare status in modern medicine of an \"old-fashioned\" specialist who thought beyond one organ,cared about people who were not his patients and indeed, about broader society. The best tribute his profession could pay him is to reflect on how each one of us could carry his flame a little bit further.\n\n* Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.
