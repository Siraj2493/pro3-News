They signal the kind of people in a multi-racial country Trump values the opinions of: mostly white men who are mirror images of the President himself.\"\n\nThe report was slammed on social media.\n\n\"So just to get this straight, CNN is objecting to a task force designed to stop an epidemic by focusing on...ethnic diversity?\" Daily Wire editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro asked.\n\n\"Your Trump hatred at CNN is a real cancer to our body politic.

Other U.S. citizens will also be on board.\n\nThe passengers will reportedly be screened for the virus when the plane makes a refueling stop in Anchorage, Alaska, and those who are medically cleared will be allowed to continue on to the continental U.S.\n\nThe plane's ultimate destination is Ontario, California, according to the U.S. Embassy in China.

There aren't many preemptive steps that can be taken to avoid infection, other than practicing basic sanitary measures on a regular basis.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends washing your hands regularly and avoiding contact with other sick people who are recovering from an illness. It also suggests avoiding touching your eyes and face, along with keeping objects and surfaces in your home or workspace clean and disinfected.\n\nChina's leaders have made major efforts to contain the spread of the virus, including the immediate construction of a 1,000-bed hospital to accommodate the growing number of patients.\n\nUnited Airlines suspended some of its flights to China on Tuesday after the viral threat caused a \"decline in demand for travel,\" to the country.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSen.

The U.S. consulate in Wuhan announced Sunday that it would evacuate its personnel and some private citizens aboard a charter flight.\n\nThe U.S. patients generally have been reported to be in good condition and were hospitalized in isolation for monitoring.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects many more Americans to be diagnosed with the newly discovered virus, which is believed to have an incubation period of about two weeks, as worldwide the number of confirmed cases nears 2,000.

Doug Perez, an American living in the quarantined city of Wuhan, described his experiences on Thursday's edition of the \"Fox News Rundown\" podcast.\n\nHe said he barely leaves the house, except to walk his dog.\n\n\"Whenever we leave [the home], we bring the dog,\" said Perez, who lives with his girlfriend and their labrador, Chubby. \"So we only take him out for walks. That's the extent of us leaving.\"\n\nPerez, who teaches English in the city, told host Dave Anthony about a \"scary experience\" in which he and his girlfriend had their temperature checked outside a grocery store where they went to stock up on food and supplies.\n\n\"We're lining up to have our temperature tested in one of those temperature guns,\" Perez said. \"Yeah, it's like something, it's like something out of a sci-fi movie.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE AND DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS RUNDOWN\n\nThe outbreak has killed at least 170 people in China and sickened more than 7,700 worldwide, with five confirmed cases in the U.S. In mainland China, it has already infected more people than were sickened during the SARS outbreak during the 2002-2003 outbreak, though the coronavirus death toll remains lower.\n\nIt's like something out of a sci-fi movie.\n\n-- Doug Perez, American living in Wuhan, China\n\nAccording to Perez, hospitals in Wuhan are overrun and people suffering from \"mild symptoms\" are being advised to stay away.\n\n\"Even the government made an official announcement in Chinese saying that ... if you're 'a little bit sick', do not come to the hospitals, we're overrun,\" he said.\n\n\"They need supplies.

He noted that food deliveries had not come through in recent days.\n\n\"The government here has taken a very, very strict, very strict and very proactive response... to this coronavirus,\" Perez said.

China's death toll from a new virus rose to 259 on Saturday and a World Health Organization official said other governments need to prepare for\"domestic outbreak control\" if the disease spreads in their countries.\n\nBeijing criticized Washington's order barring entry to most foreigners who visited China in the past two weeks.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced similar measures on Saturday, following Japan and Singapore.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea and India flew hundreds of their citizens out of Wuhan, the city at the center of an area where some 50 million people are prevented from leaving in a sweeping anti-virus effort. The evacuees went into a two-week quarantine. Indonesia also sent a plane.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe number of confirmed cases in China rose to 11,791, surpassing the number in the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The virus's rapid spread in two months prompted the World Health Organization on Thursday to declare it a global emergency.\n\nThat declaration \"flipped the switch\" from a cautious attitude earlier to recommending governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea. Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members.\n\nThe agency acted out of concern for poorer countries that might not be equipped to respond, said Galea. Such a declaration calls for a coordinated international response and can bring more money and resources.\n\nWHO said it was especially concerned that some cases abroad involved human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak control, if that happens,\" Galea told The Associated Press.\n\n\"Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak control, if that happens.\"\n\n-- Gauden Galea, WHO representative in Beijing\n\nOn Friday, the United States declared a public health emergency and President Donald Trump signed an order barring entry to foreign nationals, other than immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents, who visited China within the last 14 days, which scientists say is the virus's longest incubation period.\n\nChina criticized the U.S. controls, which it said contradicted the WHO's appeal to avoid travel bans, and \"unfriendly comments\" that Beijing was failing to cooperate.\n\n\"Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the U.S. rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill,\" said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.\n\n\"Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the U.S. rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill.\"\n\n-- Hua Chunying, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman\n\nWHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva that despite the emergency declaration, there is \"no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the ruling Communist Party postponed the end of the Lunar New Year holiday in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, for an unspecified \"appropriate extent\" and appealed to the public there to stay home.\n\nAnother locked-down city in Hubei, Huanggang, on Saturday banned almost all of its residents from leaving their homes in the most stringent controls imposed yet. The government said only one person from each household would be allowed out to shop for food once every two days.\n\n\"Others are not allowed to go out except for medical treatment, to do epidemic prevention and control work or to work in supermarkets and pharmacies,\" it said in an announcement.\n\nChina's increasingly drastic anti-disease controls started with the Jan. 23 suspension of plane, bus and train links to Wuhan, an industrial center of 11 million people. The lockdown has spread to surrounding cities.\n\nThe holiday, China's busiest annual travel season, ends Sunday in the rest of the country following a three-day extension to postpone the return to factories and offices by hundreds of millions of workers. The official Xinhua News Agency said people in Hubei who work outside the province also were given an extended holiday.\n\nThe party decision \"highlighted the importance of prevention and control of the epidemic among travelers,\" Xinhua said.\n\nAmericans returning from China will be allowed into the country, but will face screening and are required to undertake 14 days of self-screening. Those returning from Hubei province will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.\n\nBeginning Sunday, the United States will direct flights from China to seven major airports where passengers can be screened.\n\nAlso Friday, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines suspended all flights between the United States and China. Other carriers including British Airways, Finnair and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific also have canceled or cut back service to mainland China.\n\nThe U.S. order followed a travel advisory for Americans to consider leaving China. Japan and Germany also advised against non-essential travel to China and Britain did as well, except for Hong Kong and Macao.\n\nA plane carrying Indians from Wuhan landed Saturday in New Delhi. The government said they would be quarantined in a nearby city, Manesar. Sri Lanka also pulled out more of its citizens and promised to bring out the remaining 204 students.\n\nSouth Korea's second evacuation flight landed in Seoul with 330 people from Wuhan. They were to be screened for fever before being taken to two quarantine centers.\n\nSouth Korea also reported its 12th virus case, which appeared to be a human-to-human transmission.\n\nAt least 23 countries have reported cases since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December.\n\nThe death rate in China is falling but the number of confirmed cases will keep growing because there are thousands of specimens from suspected cases yet to be tested, WHO's Galea said.\n\n\"The case fatality ratio is settling out at a much lower level than we were reporting three, now four, weeks ago,\" he said.\n\nBoth the new virus and SARS are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that cause the common cold. Experts say there is evidence the new virus is spreading among people in China.\n\nAlthough scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with family or other close contact, they are concerned about cases of infection spreading to people who might have less exposure.\n\nIn Japan, a tour guide and bus driver became infected after escorting two tour groups from Wuhan. In Germany, five employees of a German auto parts supplier became ill after a Chinese colleague visited, including two who had no direct contact with the woman. She showed no symptoms until her flight back to China.\n\nOn Saturday, Japan reported its 17th case, a woman in her 20s who also worked as a guide for Wuhan tourists on the same bus as the two other cases.\n\nVietnam confirmed one more case for a total of six, and Australia counted its ninth infection.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Friday, Germany confirmed a sixth case, a child of one of the people already infected. In the United States, health officials issued a two-week quarantine order for the 195 Americans evacuated this week from Wuhan.\n\nIt was the first time a federal quarantine has been ordered since the 1960s, when one was enacted over concern about smallpox, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nNone of the Americans being housed at a Southern California military base has shown signs of illness, but infected people don't show symptoms immediately and may be able to pass on the virus before they appear sick.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox

escalates over coronavirus: What do Americans need to know?\n\nSen. Tom Cotton called on the Trump administration Tuesday to impose a \"targeted travel ban\" on flights to the United States from China to stem the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nIn a letter to members of Trump's cabinet, the Arkansas Republican outlined a four-step plan to contain the disease, starting with a ban on commercial flights from China to the U.S. The virus has now killed more than 100 people and infected thousands of others.\n\n\" There's no need for recreational, student or educational, or non-critical business travel under the circumstances until this crisis is under control,\" Cotton wrote.\n\nHOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS?\n\nHe also proposed giving Americans in China the option to evacuate and return to the U.S. under \"appropriate, elevated monitoring,\" the development of criteria for trade with China to continue and to allow medical personnel and scientists to travel there to address the crisis.\n\nHe also urged the federal government to work with the scientific community on developing a vaccine.\n\n\"Given the latest developments and the many unknowns about this virus, we ought to follow Benjamin Franklin's maxim: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" Cotton wrote. \"America is blessed with world-leading researchers and laboratories on the cutting edge of medical science and epidemiology. Working in tandem with them, I'm confident our federal research agencies can develop a vaccine in record time.\"\n\nChina has been scrambling to contain the virus, which began in Wuhan and has since infected at least 4,500 people. The city and 17 others have been quarantined, impacting up to 50 million people.\n\nCotton said the true number of deaths and infections are most likely higher due to the Chinese Communist Party's history of covering up or minimizing disease outbreaks, as it did with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) illness in 2003.\n\nFive coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the U.S., and several other countries have reported infections, as well. Additionally, 110 people in the U.S. are under investigation for possible infection.\n\nThe agency issued another advisory for the Hubei province, the capital of which is Wuhan.\n\nOther countries have also taken action to mitigate the coronavirus impact. Mongolia closed its vast border with China and Malaysia said it would bar visitors from the Chinese province where the virus first began.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news",

safest place to sit on an airplane while the coronavirus outbreak continues to expand may be the window seat, according to new research from Emory University.\n\nCRUISE LINES CONTINUE TO CANCEL DEPARTURES FROM CHINA AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\nAccording to a study by the \"FlyHealthy Research Team,\" which observed behaviors of passengers and airline crew across 10 three-hour to five-hour U.S. flights, those who were seated in the window had less contact with potentially infected people, National Geographic reported.\n\nRespiratory illnesses, like coronavirus, generally spread through a person coming into contact with an infected persons' saliva or mucus. Droplets from a sneeze or cough can land on surfaces, such as tray tables or arm rests, and potentially infect a nearby passenger sharing the enclosed space.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, those sitting in window seats had less interaction with other passengers -- beyond those sitting within two rows of them -- thus limiting their chances of interacting with an infected person, study leads Vicki Stover Hertzberg of Emory University and Howard Weiss of Penn State discovered. Those seated in aisle seats, however, were more likely to come into contact with passengers moving about the cabin to use the lavatory, or with the airline's crew members -- an average of 64 contacts, versus the window seat's 12.\n\n\"Suppose you're seated in an aisle seat or a middle seat and I walk by to go to the lavatory,\" says Weiss, professor of biology and mathematics, to National Geographic. \"We're going to be in close contact, meaning we'll be within a meter. So if I'm infected, I could transmit to you... Ours was the first study to quantify this.\"\n\nA 2018 study showed most passengers got up from their seats at some point during the flight. Those seated in window seats were least likely to move from their seats. Only 43 percent of those seated in the window got up, as opposed to 80 percent of those in the aisle.\n\nThe limited research did point out the test was not conducted over long-haul flights, or on planes with two aisles.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nHowever, the research does state that regardless of seating, there is a fairly low risk of transmission of the virus if you're seated in middle or aisle seats as other passengers will be \"moving quickly\" down the aisle.\n\n\"In aggregate, what we show is there's quite a low probability of transmission to any particular passenger,\" Weiss said.\n\nThe study also said the research model does not account for the transmission of aerosols, which is possibly how coronavirus can be spread.\n\nTo protect oneself while in close proximity to others, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer after touching surfaces. You should also avoid touching your face or mouth.\n\nMany airlines have already suspended flights to mainland China amid the outbreak, which has claimed the lives of over 130 people and sickened nearly 6,000 others as of Wednesday morning.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexandra_deabler@foxnews.com", "name": "Alexandra

To us, that level of risk is unacceptable,\" Ferguson added.\n\n\"Due to the known and unknown risks associated with traveling to China right now, concurrent with the filing of our lawsuit, we are directing all American Airlines pilots assigned to flights between the United States and China, other than those on return trips to the United States, to decline the assignment.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to Fox News on Thursday, American Airlines said that it was \"aware\" of the lawsuit's filing and would \"continue to monitor the situation,\" regarding the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"We are aware of the filing.

Flash top headlines for Jan. 27 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com\n\nChina on Monday expanded sweeping efforts to contain a viral disease by extending the Lunar New Year holiday to keep the public at home and avoid spreading infection as the death toll rose to 80.\n\nHong Kong announced it would bar entry to visitors from the mainland province at the center of the outbreak following a warning the virus's ability to spread was increasing. Travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide, adding to the rising economic cost.\n\nIncreasingly drastic anti-disease efforts began with the Jan. 22 suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China where the virus was first detected last month. That lockdown has expanded to a total of 17 cities with more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.\n\nCORONAVIRUS CASES IN ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA PUSH US TALLY TO 5\n\nThe end of the Lunar New Year holiday, China's busiest travel season, was pushed back to Sunday from Thursday to \"reduce mass gatherings\" and \"block the spread of the epidemic,\" a Cabinet statement said.\n\nTens of millions of people were due to crowd into planes, trains, and buses to return to work after visiting their hometowns or tourist sites for the holiday. Schools will postpone reopening until further notice, the Cabinet said.\n\nAlso Monday, China's No. 2 leader, Premier Li Keqiang, visited Wuhan to \"guide epidemic prevention work,\" the Cabinet website said. Photos on the site showed Li, in a blue smock and green face mask, meeting hospital employees.\n\nThe U.S. Consulate in Wuhan said it was arranging to evacuate its diplomats and some American citizens on Tuesday. The French government said it would fly its citizens in Wuhan to France and quarantine them there. Japan was preparing to fly its nationals out of Wuhan.\n\nFrench automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen, which has a factory in Wuhan, said it was moving foreign employees and their families by bus to be quarantined in another city.\n\nThe disruption to business and consumer spending threaten to depress Chinese economic growth that Beijing is struggling to shore up after it sank to a multi-decade low of 6.1% last year. That could spread shockwaves to Asian economies that rely on China as a source of tourists and export markets.\n\nChinese regulators called on banks and insurers in a statement Monday to support to people and companies affected by the outbreak.\n\nThe biggest impact will be on travel, hotels, and restaurants but Chinese retail spending, factory output, and investment also might suffer if the outbreak and quarantines last, forecasters say.\n\nThe outbreak is a \"notable downside risk\" to growth, though it \"could potentially be a high impact but short-lived event,\" said Tommy Wu and Priyanka Kishore of Oxford Economics in a report.\n\nThey pointed to the example of the 2003 SARS outbreak when economic activity plunged but recovered relatively quickly. The impact should be \"less severe\" than SARS because of faster official reaction and \"increased transparency,\" they said.\n\nAbroad, economies including Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines with big tourism industries that rely on Chinese travelers \"seem most at risk,\" said Wu and Kishore.\n\nCORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SPURS PARIS TO CANCEL LUNAR NEW YEAR PARADE, IMPACTS CELEBRATIONS WORLDWIDE\n\nThe National Health Commission said 2,744 cases were confirmed by midnight Sunday. There were 24 new deaths on Sunday, all in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.\n\nThe youngest patient is a 9-month-old girl in Beijing. China also reported five cases in Hong Kong and two in Macao.\n\nSouth Korea confirmed its fourth case Monday. Scattered cases also have been confirmed in Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, the U.S., Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France, Canada, and Australia.\n\nThe U.S. has confirmed cases in Washington state, Chicago, southern California, and Arizona.\n\nChina's health minister, Ma Xiaowei, said the country was entering a \"crucial stage\" as \"it seems like the ability of the virus to spread is getting stronger.\"\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has called the outbreak a grave situation and said the government was stepping restrictions on travel and public gatherings while rushing medical staff and supplies to Wuhan.\n\nThe epidemic has revived memories of the 2002-03 SARS outbreak that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people.\n\nThen, Chinese authorities were criticized for reacting slowly and failing to disclose information. The government has responded more aggressively to the latest outbreak.\n\nThe National Health Commission said anyone traveling from Wuhan is required to register with community health stations and quarantine themselves at home for 14 days -- the virus' maximum incubation period.\n\nHong Kong announced it would bar entry to travelers from Hubei, starting Monday. Hong Kong residents returning from the area will be allowed to the territory but were told to quarantine themselves at home.\n\nTwo of Hong Kong's most popular tourist attractions, Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park, closed.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: 56 DEAD AND 1,975 INFECTED AS CANADA REPORTS 1ST CASE\n\nAlso Sunday, Wuhan banned most vehicle use, including private cars, in downtown areas. The city will assign 6,000 taxis to neighborhoods to help people get around if they need to.\n\nWuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week.\n\nThe National Health Commission said it is sending extra medical teams to Wuhan. The Chinese military dispatched 450 medical staff, some with experience in past outbreaks including SARS and Ebola.\n\nThe virus is from the coronavirus family that includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan. On Sunday, authorities banned trade in wild animals and called on the public to refrain from eating meat from them.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"},

crisis", "body": "The \"Flipping Out\" alum, 49, opened Thursday's episode of his show \"Jeff Lewis Live\" and issued an apology for remarks he and his guest co-hosts made on the air.\n\n\"We love our Asian listeners and we would never want them to feel excluded,\" Lewis said, according to People. \"We also never meant to spread hate or breed racism with our comments.\"\n\nLewis' denouncement came after he and fellow home interior designer Megan Weaver, Cheri Oteri, actor Doug Budin, actress Monika Casey and real estate agent Carrie Lewis discussed the trending coronavirus outbreak in China and joked about the steps they would take in order to prevent contracting the illness.\n\nAccording to People, Lewis and company said they would avoid eating at restaurants such as Panda Express and Chin Chin, refuse calls from Asian listeners, avoid venturing to Asian-dominated communities such as Chinatown and Los Angeles' famed TCL Chinese Theatre and even \"quarantine\" Asian American SiriusXM employees.\n\nFLIPPING OUT' STARS JEFF LEWIS AND JENNI PULOS ARE NO LONGER WORKING TOGETHER: REPORT\n\n\"Apparently, I did incense a few people. I actually feel bad about it. I was joking around and it went a little too far,\" he continued. \"I apologize for being such an a--. I want people to have fun when they listen to this show... So I just wanted to apologize. I'm very sorry for crossing the line.\"\n\nLewis said he was not coerced by his employer to apologize.\n\n\"No one has told me to apologize yet. This was on my own,\" he said. \"I felt like I went a little too far.\"\n\n\"I personally, truly, was kidding -- was joking. Being sarcastic,\" Lewis said. \"I love all my listeners and I truly do not care about their ethnicity. I don't care about their religious background. I don't care about income level. I don't care about their height. I don't care if they're 3 feet tall. I don't care if they don't have arms. I don't care if they're transitioning. I don't care if they have special needs.

She is so concerned, she has quarantined them,\" Lewis had quipped of Weaver on Tuesday's show.\n\nLewis even said Weaver was unaware of the family ties said employees might have to China, thus: \"She has no idea and doesn't care, she is so afraid of the coronavirus.\"\n\n'FLIPPING OUT' STAR JEFF LEWIS ON HOW TO SURVIVE HOUSING MARKET MELTDOWN\n\nWeaver played along with Lewis, adding that she was \"terrified\" of the epidemic and would be boycotting Panda Express \"until this is all over.\"\n\nThen, Budin chimed in: \"Megan was nervous like, 'What if an Asian person calls in to the show? We shouldn't even take the call.'\"\n\n\"It's too dangerous,\" Lewis said.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday's show, the comments ramped up and Lewis decreed that \"we quarantine all Asian SiriusXM employees.\"\n\n\"This would include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Burmese, Filipino, Indonesian, et cetera,\" Lewis doubled down. \"I'm sure there's more. That's all we could think of. We'll see how that goes.\"\n\nBRANDI GLANVILLE THROWS WINE ON 'FLIPPING OUT' STAR JEFF LEWIS\n\nLewis continued in his berating of the Asian population and alleged that while he was a student at the University of Southern California, \"[in] my experience, the Asians were the biggest cheaters of all.\"\n\n\"Now, I cheat too. I cheated, most of my friends cheated, but I'm just telling you what happened,\" Lewis ranted. \"In those classes, those Asians were the biggest cheaters. And I think cause they got the most pressure from their parents. My dad didn't give a s---. I didn't have a lot of pressure. But those kids, I blame the parents. Those kids were under so much pressure.\"\n\nThen, out of nowhere, Lewis' sister-in-law Carrie offered: \"I was an English major, so there were no Asians in my class.\"\n\n\"It's racist Wednesday, here at 'Jeff Lewis Live,'\" Lewis then declared.\n\nThe former HGTV star concluded his rant by alleging that the reason for the spread of the deadly coronavirus is due to the substandard dietary habits of Asian people.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"They're saying the coronavirus, it's a bat virus that then transmitted to snakes because snakes eat bats. The Chinese eat snakes, they eat all kinds of s--- over there,\" he claimed. \"That's probably why we're in this trouble. Allegedly. They eat bats... mice. And then they wonder why they're sick!\"\n\nAs of Friday, there had been more than 9,600 confirmed cases of the coronavirus with more than 200 deaths. Officials said that the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. remains at six, with the latest being an Illinois man whose wife was diagnosed with the virus after traveling to Wuhan, which is

nationals flew out of China on Friday and is expected to arrive at Royal Air Force Brize Norton in Oxfordshire at 1 p.m. (8 a.m. EST), according to the British Government.\n\n\"We know how distressing the situation has been for those waiting to leave,\" Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a notice. \"We have been working round the clock to clear the way for a safe departure. The welfare of those trapped and public safety have been our overriding priorities.\"\n\nThe plane will then travel to Spain where the passenger's home countries will take responsibility for them, the notice said. Chinese officials had originally blocked the flight on Thursday morning, which expected to leave Wuhan with 200 people.\n\nMeanwhile, people in China are defying a lockdown by leaving and entering a bridge over the Yangzte River in Hubei province -- the country's virus epicenter. It's been on lockdown for vehicles, but people could still get out in \"special circumstances,\" according to Reuters.\n\nWeeks after China announced the outbreak of the coronavirus, the international community has increased measures to prevent a widespread epidemic.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global emergency as it spreads to countries outside of China and the number of infected patients continues to grow.\n\nCountries around the globe have increased travel restrictions to the infected mainland China and Hubei province -- with the U.S. State Department increasing its advisory to level 4: \"Do Not Travel.\"\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT, CITING CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, RAISES CHINA TRAVEL ADVISORY: 'DO NOT TRAVEL'\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have advised travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country.\n\nCoronavirus has now infected more people in China than were sickened during the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. No deaths have been reported outside of the country.\n\nThe death toll from the virus has increased to 213 on Friday, with a total of 9,692 infected. The number of cases has increased more than tenfold in a week, with 43 new deaths reported on Friday, the most in a 24-hour-period.\n\nTRUMP SAYS US WORKING CLOSELY WITH CHINA ON CORONAVIRUS\n\nWhere is the virus?\n\nRoughly 99 percent of new cases have appeared in China with the vast majority of the cases in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan. The virus has been reported in at least 16 countries globally.\n\nThe United States currently has six cases of the virus: two in California, one in Arizona, one in Washington and two in Illinois, health officials say. The sixth case was confirmed Thursday in a Chicago resident, who is the spouse of the first confirmed travel-related case in Illinois. The new case marks the first in the U.S. that occurred via person-to-person transmission, CDC officials said.\n\nThe United Kingdom announced on Friday it has two cases of the virus, who are reportedly members of the same family.\n\n\"The patients are receiving specialist NHS [National Health Service] care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus,\" said Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer.\n\nOfficials at the CDC have advised travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country. The U.S. State Department raised its China travel advisory to \"Level 4: Do Not Travel.\" The U.S. expanded the screening of travelers arriving from Wuhan from five to 20 airports.\n\n\"Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus,\" The advisory said.\n\nHOW IS CORONAVIRUS TRANSMITTED?\n\nPakistan says they're halting all flights to and from China until Feb. 2.\n\nSingapore said it would ban travelers from China's Hubei province.\n\nThe United Kingdom and New Zealand also advised their people against nonessential travel to China.\n\nRussia has signed an order to close the border between them and China. They also blocked tour groups from China.\n\nChina has cut off access to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, trapping more than 50 million people.\n\nItaly suspended all flights to China\n\nSouth Korea urged an increase in its level of caution to \"restraint\" when traveling to China.\n\nHong Kong reduced half its flights and shut down rail service to mainland China.\n\nUnited Airlines, the largest U.S. airline to China suspended some flights to hub cities in China and reduced daily departures from 12 to four.\n\nUnited's pilots, concerned for their safety, will be able to drop trips to China without pay, a union memo said, according to Reuters.\n\nAmerican Airlines suspended L.A. flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing.\n\nThe Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents 15,000 pilots for American Airlines filed a lawsuit to halt service with the airline, citing \"serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus.\"\n\n\"I am directing all APA pilots to cease flight operations between the United States and China,\" said APA president Eric Ferguson. \"Until further notice, if you are scheduled, assigned, or reassigned a pairing into China, decline the assignment by calling your Chief Pilot or IOC Duty Pilot. Inform them you are declining in accordance with the CDC and WHO declarations.\"\n\nAMERICAN AIRLINES SUED OVER CORONAVIRUS BY PLOT SEEKING TO CANCEL US-CHINA FLIGHTS\n\nDelta airlines reducing

two weeks, the whole world has been monitoring and keeping tabs on the coronavirus outbreak that started in China.\n\nEvery day, we see the contagion growing and thousands of people in China are infected. Today, we see the announcement that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is declaring a national emergency. However, the president's Coronavirus Task Force has emphasized that the American public is at low risk. Even though the strain is new, this virus is similar to those seen in other outbreaks, such as the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. Yet, it is a deadly virus and there are still many unknowns as so far as the behavior of the disease.\n\nIncubation symptoms usually take from 7 to 14 days and because of the nature of this virus, it is very contagious in human-to-human transmission. I have been asked how worried Americans should be. I believe that rather than worried, we must be proactive and educated.\n\nI am very confident in President Trump's task force because its membership is composed of brilliant scientists and epidemiologists, as well as leaders of government health care divisions. There are also many scientific companies already working on a vaccine.\n\nCORONAVIRUS DECLARED PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN THE US\n\nThe most important question is: How do Americans get prepared? I have a few suggestions that I want to share.\n\nWe already know about travel bans where this epidemic is growing - so don't travel to China. We also know that there is going to be monitoring and possible quarantines of patients who have recently arrived from that region.\n\nHowever, we must also focus on our health. When you look at ways that many people have died from coronavirus, most of those cases have been from pulmonary complications. Most patients die from complications of pneumonia. When you get massive pneumonia from a viral infection, you have severe inflammation of lung tissue, which interferes with oxygenation and ultimately compromises other organs such as your heart, kidneys and liver. In other words, a septic shock develops.\n\nMany times, pneumonia from viral infections also leads to a bacterial infection. This complicates the ability of your body to fight back and makes it difficult for your physicians to treat your infection.\n\nUNITED AIRLINES CANCELS ALL FLIGHTS TO MAINLAND CHINA AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\nSo, here's what we should all think about:\n\nFirst, most viral pneumonia outbreaks occur in people who are older or very young, i.e. infants. It also occurs in people with chronic diseases such as COPD, cardiac problems, congestive heart failure, Type 2 Diabetes, renal disease, and patients undergoing cancer treatment. Also, individuals with immunodeficiency disorders.\n\nThere are, however, some things that we can do to protect ourselves:\n\nPneumococcal Vaccine\n\nThe pneumococcal vaccine is strongly recommended for older folks. Vaccines literally work like armies in your body to fight the infections that could make problems if you develop pneumonia. People over Age 65 should talk to their physician about getting the pneumococcal vaccine.\n\nFlu Vaccine.\n\nThis is not a vaccine to think about. The flu vaccine is important for everyone as early as 6 months old. Please get it!\n\nTDAP Vaccine\n\nThe famous whooping cough is a problematic disease. This vaccine gives your body the proper antibodies to fight secondary infections that you might get from viral pneumonia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe rationale for all the vaccines that I have mentioned is not that they will directly prevent you from getting the coronavirus, but they can prevent you from getting secondary complications. Getting the proper vaccines improves the ability of your body to fight and that is why it is important for you to consider them.\n\nThis is a good time not to worry, but to think about your health. This is a good time to stop the procrastination and have that conversation with your doctor. This is a good time to see how your own health is important and follow up on the recommendations of the doctors that have been advising us all to do the right thing.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "manny_alvarez@foxnews.com", "name": "Manny Alvarez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_period", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incubation period"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transmission (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumococcal_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumococcal vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streptococcus pneumoniae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Septic shock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 31}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/01/1024/512/WuhanChina1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 7}, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 7, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1428111532", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-29", "time": "20:15:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-29T20:15:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-29T20:13:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/coronavirus-case-asu-petition-cancel-classes", "title": "Coronavirus case at ASU prompts petition for university to cancel classes", "body": "Both coronavirus patients in California are travelers from Wuhan, China; Los Angeles County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis weighs in.\n\nStudents at Arizona State University are demanding the cancellation of classes after the nation's fifth and most recent case of the novel coronavirus was confirmed in Arizona.\n\nThe patient involved in the fifth case is a part of the ASU community, according to a news release from the school.

The rumor quickly took hold on the social media platform, leading to hundreds of tweets and even a petition to cancel class amid the alleged \"outbreak\" at the university.\n\nBRITISH AIRWAYS SUSPENDS ALL FLIGHTS TO CHINA AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\nBut USC quickly responded, shutting down rumors that seemingly cropped up after an unnamed student living at the off-campus Lorenzo Apartments was transported by ambulance to a local hospital.\n\nThe outbreak has sickened nearly 6,000 people and been linked to at least 132 deaths. The number of cases confirmed in mainland China has now surpassed those that were sickened during a SARS outbreak in 2002-2003.

coronavirus hospital in a week", "body": "Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel breaks it down on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'\n\nIn a bid to address the soaring number of coronavirus cases in Wuhan and nearby cities, Chinese officials ordered the construction of a 1,000-bed hospital that they aim to have completed by Feb. 3. The plans, officials said, would follow a similar model to the hospital constructed in Beijing during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, which took a week to complete and wound up treating around 700 patients.\n\nChinese State Construction Engineering said it sent over 100 workers to the site to get started, and officials said they would be using prefabricated structures to create the hospital, cutting the time typically associated with creating new facilities.\n\nPERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION OF CORONAVIRUS REPORTED IN US, CDC SAYS\n\n\"What's different about these structures is that they are primarily designed using structural steel boxes, which allow them to be stacked on top of one another,\" Grant Geiger, CEO of EIR Healthcare, told Fox News via email, comparing the structures to a custom-engineered shipping container.\n\nGeiger, who is not involved in the Wuhan project but whose company is focused on building smart hospitals in less time and money, also said that a facility being constructed as part of an emergency response does not face the same regulatory tape that a typical new building would.\n\nCORONAVIRUS DEATH TOLL INCREASES, HERE'S LATEST UPDATE ON CASES\n\n\"A traditional inpatient hospital might take two-plus years to build because there are state and local protections in place such as zoning laws, code requirements, etc.,\" he said. \"In an emergency response situation, providing clinical care is paramount.\"\n\nAnd while typical construction may elicit visions of plumbers and electricians trying to match schedules with contractors, in this situation Geiger said that the structures typically come already equipped and pre-wired.\n\n\"In an emergency response program, a hospital is developed as a kit of parts and stored to be deployed when needed,\" he said. \"Everything is already pre-designed and engineered to fit together.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE FOX HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\nThe virus, which has sickened more than 7,700 people and been linked to at least 170 deaths, is also transmissible between humans, and patients are largely kept in isolation to prevent the illness from spreading further. Geiger said the hospital will likely be equipped with special mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems to keep patients and workers protected from contamination.\n\nHe also said that the hospital will likely feature a specialized air filtration system that would have been planned out before the facility was even constructed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPhotos from the construction site published Thursday by the Associated Press showed dozens of cranes and workers walking around the construction site with several structures already in place.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexandria_hein@foxnews.com", "name": "Alexandria Hein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Siegel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marc Siegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Structural steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_SARS_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timeline of the SARS outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intermodal container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plumbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(machine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crane (machine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Consulting", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/01/1024/512/china_hospital_ap.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 5}, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 5, "relevance": 101}], "totalResults": 87, "page": 1, "count": 25, "pages": 4}}
