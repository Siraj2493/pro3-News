Marco Rubio warns of the risk posed by China's control of the drug market and explains what can be done on 'Fox &amp; Friends.'\n\nNow that the number of new people infected with the coronavirus in China is slowing, the country's Communist Party is ratcheting up threats against the West, with a particularly nasty warning about access to life-saving drugs aimed at the United States.\n\nIn an article in Xinhua, the state-run media agency that's largely considered the mouthpiece of the party, Beijing bragged about its handling of COVID-19, a virus that originated in Wuhan and has spread quickly around the world, killing nearly 5,000 people and infecting thousands more. The article also claimed that China could impose pharmaceutical export controls which would plunge America into \"the mighty sea of coronavirus.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS IMPACT ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT: CLOSURES, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AND MORE\n\nThe disturbing threats made during a global pandemic as well as the scary consequences if that threat becomes real highlight just how tight China's grip is on the global supply chain. Already, the FDA has announced the first drug shortage related to the coronavirus. Though it did not disclose which drug was in short supply, the FDA did say it could not access enough raw components needed because they are made in China.\n\nThat doesn't come as a surprise to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, who told Fox News on Thursday that America is \"dangerously reliant\" on China for the production of critical goods, including parts for technologies needed to fight COVID-19.\n\nPHOTOS: CONTAINMENT ZONE IN NEW ROCHELLE, NY\n\nPHOTOS: EMPTY STREETS AMID CORONAVIRUS FEARS IN US CITIES\n\nThough the United States is a global leader in drug discovery, much of the manufacturing has moved overseas. The last American manufacturing plant to make a key component in penicillin shuttered in 2004. Since then, Chinese pharmaceuticals companies have taken over, supplying between 80 percent and 90 percent of U.S. antibiotics, 70 percent of acetaminophen and about 40 percent of heparin, according to Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nTOP CORONAVIRUS SCAMS TO BE AWARE OF\n\nIf China makes good on its threat to cut off the United States, Rubio believes the results could be crippling.\n\nThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide on Thursday went up to 124,518, up from 118,162 cases the day before. In China, there are 80,980 confirmed cases. Italy saw a 22.7 percent jump to 12,462 from 10,149. Iran is hovering close to a 12 percent increase while cases in Qatar jumped 991 percent to 262 cases from 24. In the United States, there are more than 1,300 confirmed cases spread across 44 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON: RACIST FOR SAYING 'CHINESE CORONAVIRUS'? NOW'S NOT THE TIME FOR THE DUMBEST IDENTITY POLITICS\n\nAs the rest of the world scrambles to contain the virus and protect its citizens, China has been busy casting itself in the role of global hero going so far as to demand a thank you for containing the virus as long as it did.\n\n\"We should say righteously that the U.S. owes China an apology, the world owes China a thank you,\" an editorial in Xinhua read.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRubio said Beijing's comments should concern all Americans and that China is keenly aware that \"in a moment of crisis -- the U.S. and China have a showdown or something and they can threaten to cut us off from our pharmaceutical supplies, they could trigger a domestic problem here that would make it difficult or us to confront them.\"",

He said the \"strong but necessary\" restrictions would not apply to the United Kingdom.\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, the U.S. and many other nations have enacted tough measures to contain the illness, including barring foreign visitors from countries ravaged by the outbreak.\n\nThe Trump administration so far has barred travelers from mainland China, where the virus originated last December, and Iran, which also has seen a spike in infections, from entering the United States.\n\nThe restrictions covered any foreign nationals who visited those countries within the past 14 days.\n\nJAPAN AIRLINES CABIN ATTENDANT TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS: REPORT\n\n\"Iran is not a trustworthy state actor, as it has repeatedly demonstrated through its history of engaging in malign activity, and confirmed most recently by its repeated denials of responsibility for shooting down an international airliner,\" the White House said in a February news release announcing the measures.\n\nAmerican travelers returning from China and Iran have been screened for symptoms in one of 11 airports.\n\nThe virus has killed over 4,200 people and sickened nearly 120,000 others globally.

amid coronavirus fears", "body": "President Trump addresses the media following meeting with lawmakers on coronavirus at Capitol Hill.\n\nPresident Trump on Tuesday floated the idea of temporarily doing away with the payroll tax in order to give the U.S. economy a boost as it struggles amid fears over the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nTrump proposed reducing the payroll tax for both employers and employees from 14.4 percent to zero during a lunch with Republican senators where the economic response to the coronavirus was the main subject of conversation.\n\nAdditionally, sources told Fox News that Trump would like to eventually make the payroll tax cut permanent and fund Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance from general revenues.\n\nThe president first mentioned the idea of temporally halting the payroll tax on Monday during a news conference alongside the White House's coronavirus task force. He also mentioned moves to aid small businesses and help hourly workers who might become sick.\n\n\"They'll be very dramatic,\" Trump said of the proposed economic measures during an evening briefing at the White House. \"This blindsided the world and I think we handled it very well.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow were on Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Republicans on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nStill, there are mixed reactions from Republicans on Capitol Hill about the proposal of a payroll tax holiday. One source familiar with the proposal tells Fox News that addressing the payroll tax is \"the fastest possible way\" to address economic concerns. The source said that crafting proposals such as \"unemployment insurance and dropping money out of helicopters takes months to engineer. But the payroll tax could hit immediately - especially if they include both employers and employees.\n\n\"(The payroll tax) helps in all red places but not all blue places,\" said the source.\n\nBut there is reluctance among some Republicans is that it explodes the deficit.\n\nKudlow told reporters Friday that the administration is not looking at a \"massive\" federal relief plan. Rather, any federal aid package would be \"timely and targeted and micro.\"\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill had barely started to contemplate the economic implications of the spread of the virus and what might be needed to stimulate the economy as people cancel vacations and business trips and stay away from stores. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told reporters that \"everything's on the table.\"\n\nBut members of the Senate Republican leadership, including Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, played down the need for an economic stimulus package of any kind, be it tax cuts or aid for workers. \"It's premature to be talking about that,\" Cornyn told reporters. \"I usually love tax cuts but I think it's a little premature.\"\n\nDemocrats have indicated they prefer other responses, such as passing legislation requiring employers to give their workers paid sick leave -- a longtime policy priority of Democrats -- and additional help for those with lower incomes.\n\nThe stock market appeared to rebound a day after falling to its lowest point since the 2008 financial crisis following the news of Trump's meeting with Senate Republicans.\n\nThe S&P 500 surged as much as 3.7 percent in the morning, only to see those gains evaporate by midday. The index then bounced up and down before turning decisively higher following Trump's meeting.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe moves reflected the mood of a market just as preoccupied with the virus as the rest of the world. Since U.S. stocks set their record high just a few weeks ago, traders have crossed over from dismissing the economic pain created by COVID-19 -- thinking it's similar to the flu and could stay mostly contained in China -- to being in thrall to it, worrying that it may cause a worldwide recession.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nThe vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.\n\nBut because the virus is new, experts can't say for sure how far it will ultimately spread. That has investors worried about the worst-case scenario for corporate profits and the economy, where factories and supply chains are shut around the world due to quarantines and people stay huddled at home instead of working or spending.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_o_reilly@foxnews.com", "name": "Andrew O'Reilly",

At its worst, it's a reckless display from a country that has actively misled the world while working overtime to save its own skin, foreign affairs expert Gordon G. Chang told Fox News.\n\nChang believes Beijing has been laying the groundwork for a PR attack against the United States for more than a month, first by throwing doubt on the origin of COVID-19 and second, by slamming America's handling of previous diseases like the swine flu, which decimated China's pork industry.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nOn Sunday, Lin Songtian, China's ambassador to South Africa, said: \"Although the epidemic first broke out in China, it did not necessarily mean that the virus is originated from China, let alone 'made in China.'\"\n\nVague and misleading statements like the one from Lin are ripped right out of China's propaganda playbook and attempt to sow doubt about the global crisis.\n\nChinese officials have also pushed back on the expression \"Wuhan coronavirus\" -- saying the name used frequently by U.S. conservative commentators unfairly stigmatizes the world's most populous country.\n\nCORONAVIRUS FEARS HIT FEVER PITCH AMID NEW TRAVEL BAN; PANDEMIC SENDS WALL STREET, NBA, HOLLYWOOD REELING\n\nChang said it's just another tactic in China's playbook, carefully choreographed to make Americans look petty and racist.\n\n\"This an all-out assault on the United States,\" Chang said.\n\nIn December, when the coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, many media around the world began referring to it as the \"Wuhan virus.\" But last month, the World Health Organization renamed the illness COVID-19 so as not to link it to a specific location or group of people.\n\nThe name change didn't stop some, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who blew past warnings and deliberately referred to it as the \"Wuhan virus\" after China's foreign ministry called it \"highly irresponsible\" to do so.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, went even further Wednesday.\n\n\"Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,\" O'Brien said at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. \"There's lots of open-source reporting from China, from Chinese nationals, that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation, or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out. It probably cost the world community two months.\"\n\nO'Brien said if experts would have had those two months to get ahead of the spread of the virus, \"I think we could have dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what's now happening across the world.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the Communist Party is pointing the finger at the U.S. so it can dampen discontent back home.\n\n\"The Chinese military portal Xilu.com recently published an article baselessly claiming that the virus is 'a biochemical weapon produced by the U.S. to target China,'\" Rubio said.\n\nArkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, has frequently used the term \"Wuhan virus\" on the Senate floor.\n\nEarlier this week, several social media users took House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to task when he referred to it as \"the Chinese coronavirus.\"\n\nMCCARTHY KNOCKS DEMS AFTER THEY CLAIM SAYING 'CHINESE CORONAVIRUS' IS RACIST\n\nInstead of backing down, Chang believes officials should keep calling COVID-19 the \"Wuhan virus\" and push back on accusations of racism.\n\n\"This isn't a Republican thing. We all need to unite and for people to say, 'this is racist' is irresponsible,\" Chang said. \"There is no race known as Wuhanese.\"\n\nChang also said calling COVID-19 the \"Wuhan virus\" or \"Chinese coronavirus\" keeps pressure on the Chinese government and forces it to be held accountable by the rest of the world for its initial response to the global crisis, which was widely regarded as abysmal.\n\nChina, though, is using everything in its arsenal to paint itself as a global hero, rewriting history and going so far as to demand a thank you for containing the virus as long as it did.\n\n\"We should say righteously that the U.S. owes China an apology, the world owes China a thank you,\" an editorial on state news agency Xinhua read.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlso peculiar is that Beijing -- which is normally quick to censor news -- has refused to step in as a wave of anti-American conspiracy theories flood the internet. Among the rumors is that the U.S. created the coronavirus to make China look bad as well as one that accuses the government of covering up thousands of deaths by classifying them as the regular flu.\n\n\"It's more than just some disinformation or an official narrative,\" Xiao Qiang, an adjunct professor at the University of California at Berkeley's Schools of Information, told The Washington Post. \"It's an orchestrated, all-out campaign by the Chinese government through every channel at a level you rarely see.

Siegel dives into everything we know so far about COVID-19 on 'Fox &amp; Friends.'\n\nA new report out of Beijing suggests the first confirmed case of the coronavirus can be traced back to mid-November, a month earlier than the Chinese government has claimed it knew about it.\n\nGovernment documents seen by the South China Morning Post show the first reported case of COVID-19 surfaced on November 17. Scientists believe that a 55-year-old person from Hubei, a province in central China, could be \"patient zero\" though that has not yet been confirmed.\n\nWAYS THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK COULD END, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS\n\nOf the first nine cases to be reported in November -- four men and five women -- none have turned out to be \"patient zero,\" a term used to refer to the person identified as the first carrier of a communicable disease.\n\nEach day after November 17, one to five new cases were reported, and by December 15, the number of infections had grown to 27. Five days later, the number reached 60, the SCMP said.\n\nOn December 27, Zhang Jixian, a Chinese doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told health authorities that the peculiar pneumonia-like illness infecting people was actually caused by a new coronavirus. Three days later, the number of confirmed cases had jumped to 266. Twenty-four hours later, the number spiked to 381.\n\nVISITING THE DOCTOR DURING CORONAVIRUS: SHOULD YOU RESCHEDULE YOUR APPOINTMENT?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's website, which relies on countries to report their statistics to them, China's first confirmed COVID-19 case was on December 8. However, a report published in the medical journal The Lancet by Chinese doctors who treated some of the earliest known patients put the date of the first known infection at December 1.\n\nChina's handling of the crisis has come under scrutiny with some accusing the communist country of hiding the information it knew about the deadly disease and when it knew it.\n\nNearly 81,000 people in China, the world's most populous country, have been diagnosed with coronavirus. Of those, about 61,000 have recovered from COVID-19, which causes similar symptoms to the flu, such as fever and cough. In older adults and people who already have health problems, the virus strikes harder, causing severe illnesses such as pneumonia. While most recover in about 14 days, for those who are in the high-risk category, getting better could take up to six weeks.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA Friday morning global roundup

Here's how it can benefit you.\n\nA new study suggests that the novel coronavirus COVID-19 can remain in the air for up to three hours, and live on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for up to three days.\n\nThe research, published in the medRxiv depository, also notes that the virus can remain on copper surfaces for four hours and carboard for up to 24 hours. The research found it could stay on stainless steel and plastic for anywhere between two and three days.\n\n\"Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days,\" the researchers wrote in the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.\n\nCORONAVIRUS FEARS HAVE PROMPTED CHINA TO CLOSE EVEREST ACCESS VIA TIBET, CLIMBERS SAY\n\nAnother study published in February concluded that if COVID-19 is similar to other coronaviruses, such as SARS or MERS, it could live on surfaces like metal, glass and plastic for up to nine days, Fox News previously reported. By comparison, the flu virus can only live on surfaces for approximately 48 hours.\n\nThat study, published in the Journal of Hospital Infection, suggested that coronaviruses could be \"efficiently inactivated\" with disinfectants that contain \"62-71 percent ethanol, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide or 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute,\" adding that other agents that contain \"0.05-0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02 percent chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nCurrently, there is no specific medicine to cure or

Martin Luther King Jr., reacts on 'Fox &amp; Friends.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump has declared this day, this 15th day of March, 2020 AD, (Anno Domini - the Year of our Lord), to be a National Day of Prayer, in order to bring the country soulfully together in a battle against an evil enemy called the coronavirus.\n\nTrump tweeted, \"No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!\"\n\nIt is certainly not the first time a president has called for prayer. Throughout America's history, her commanders in chief have understood the power of prayer and the humility required to bow heads in reverent acknowledgment that we are not sufficient unto ourselves.\n\nROBERT MORGAN: TRUMP'S NATIONAL DAY OR PRAYER DECLARATION HAS DEEP AMERICAN ROOTS\n\nAbraham Lincoln, who led the country through a Civil War and paid the ultimate price for his stalwart vigilance to keep the Union together, famously said about prayer, \"I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had no where else to go. My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day.\"\n\nThe pandemic COVID-19 has given many of us that same feeling of there being nowhere else to turn to save ourselves. Being vigilant about washing hands, sanitizing our homes and workplaces, and keeping a distance between our fellow citizens .. seems like only a temporary or flimsy barrier to a raging tsunami.\n\nTo close the churches where people go for comfort and spiritual strength - as an act of fighting against this biological scourge - seems like a surrender to Satan.\n\nBut ah! We have one quiver in our arsenal that Satan cannot thwart. It is the power of prayer!\n\nAs a person of faith and a journalist I have been confronted many times by skeptics who do not believe in the power of prayer, who see it as just the antiquated thinking of an uneducated mind.\n\nPrayer recalibrates our hearts. It is a way of being that puts God in the center square; in the epicenter of our souls and redirects our desires.\n\nStill we are a praying nation, much more than any other Western country. Yet do we really understand what prayer is? Do we believe that prayer changes our circumstances? Or is prayer a magic incantation, a summoning of the cosmos to give us what we desire?\n\nIt's actually so much more and so much less at the same time.\n\n\"Prayer,\" simply put, \"is a declaration of dependence on God,\" says Philip Yancey in his book \"Prayer: Does It Make.Any Difference?\" (Zondervan 2006). It is a mindset, a way of living out Psalm 46, \"Be still and know that I Am God. I will be exalted among the Nations. I will be exalted in the earth.\"\n\nPrayer recalibrates our hearts. It is a way of being that puts God in the center square; in the epicenter of our souls and redirects our desires.\n\nDoes God know our plight? Absolutely. Will He listen to our prayers? Most certainly.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIf the coronavirus is part of Satan's arsenal of evil, then we should all be confident that God will prevail in this battle. The Christian belief is that Satan has already been defeated. That Jesus by dying on the cross vanquished this peddler of pain, this maestro of misery. Those who believe need not fear death or even sickness. We need only put our hope in the One who is ultimately in charge.\n\nPrayer is the power we have to tap into God's protection. To make Him our refuge, to find our shelter under His wings. There is so much we - and the medical minds looking for a vaccine - still do not understand about this virus.\n\nSo pray that God guides them to better knowledge; pray for the people already infected, that they recover quickly; pray for their families; pray for those who need assurances that the world cares; pray for yourself and your co-workers; Pray for the government officials, that they be guided in their work to keep our nation running; pray for the schools, the hospitals, the buses and byways. Pray!\n\n\"If my people who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\" (2 Chronicles 7:14 KJV)", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_green@foxnews.com", "name": "Lauren Green", "type":

News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel discusses coronavirus, social distancing and canceled events.\n\nA JetBlue passenger who flew from New York to Florida while awaiting test results for COVID-19 has been banned from flying with the airline for life.\n\nThe news comes after JetBlue Flight 253, which arrived at Palm Beach International Airport (PBIA) on Wednesday at 8:30 p.m, was held on the tarmac for three hours while medical personnel helped to remove two elderly passengers. The rest of the flight's 112 passengers were eventually allowed to leave the aircraft at 11:30 p.m.\n\nHOW TO DISINFECT YOUR PLANE SEAT\n\nJetBlue later said that one of the passengers on the plane had previously been tested for the coronavirus, and that he had boarded the flight knowing that he was awaiting the results. Health and fire officials said the passenger's test came back positive, though it's unclear exactly when the passenger learned of the COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nAnother traveler aboard the flight told CNBC that the passenger learned he was infected with the coronavirus via a text message while still on the flight, and was overheard speaking about the diagnosis by crew members. JetBlue, however, did not say exactly how they were informed of the situation.\n\nIn a statement shared with Fox News, JetBlue confirmed the passenger had been banned from flying with the airline \"in the future.\"\n\n\"The health and safety of our customers and crewmembers is our first priority. In reviewing last night's event, we determined the customer boarded our flight knowing he was awaiting results for a coronavirus test without disclosing it to anyone at JetBlue,\" the airline wrote in a statement.\n\n\"Consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, we ask all customers who are not feeling well, who believe they may have coronavirus, or who are awaiting test results to avoid travel until they are cleared by a medical professional,\" it continued.\n\n\"Last night's event put our crewmembers, customers, and federal and local officials in an unsettling situation that could have easily been avoided, and as such, this customer will not be permitted to fly on JetBlue in the future.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe CDC currently says the risk of infection spreading on airplanes is \"low,\" as \"most viruses and other germs do not spread easily\" due to the ventilation systems in place on aircraft. Still, passengers should remain cautious, avoid contact with anyone exhibiting symptoms and wash or sanitize hands often, according to CDC guidelines.\n\nExperts have also shared tips for passengers

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-declares-national-emergency-coronavirus", "title": "Trump declares national emergency over coronavirus, enlists private sector", "body": "A National Emergency has been declared on Coronavirus, what that means for Americans.\n\nPresident Trump on Friday declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak amid extensive disruptions to the economy and American life, announcing partnerships with major U.S. companies to expand testing capabilities while saying he believes the crisis \"will pass.\"\n\nThe president also announced that he would be tested for coronavirus \"fairly soon,\" after having been in contact with several individuals who have self-quarantined, or tested positive for the virus.\n\nAmid concerns over the availability of testing for coronavirus across the country, the president said his administration is working to \"dramatically increase the availability of tests.\"\n\n\"We are announcing a new partnership with the private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the coronavirus,\" Trump said during the Rose Garden press conference. \"We want people to take a test quickly if they need. But we don't want people to take the test if we feel they shouldn't be doing it.\"\n\nThe president's declaration of a national emergency means that he will enact the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which allows the White House to mobilize the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and direct federal aid to states hit by disasters and health crises.\n\n\"I am officially declaring a national emergency -- two very big words,\" Trump continued. \"The action I am taking will open up access to up to $50 billion...and a large amount of money for states, territories and localities.\"\n\nHe added: \"We've been working very hard on this. We will overcome the threat of the virus.\"\n\nAccording to the latest FEMA report to Congress, which was transmitted Feb. 29, 2020, there is $42.6 billion in the Disaster Relief Fund, which can be tapped under a Stafford Act declaration.\n\nIn addition to declaring an emergency under the Stafford Act, the president also declared an emergency under the National Emergencies Act, which allows the Department of Health and Human Services to waive certain guidelines related to Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP to address the coronavirus.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump was joined by the official coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Pence and leaders of major corporations and businesses, including Target, Walgreens, Quest Diagnostics and CVS Health. Trump said that with federal emergency authorities, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new test of the virus, which would provide \"half a million additional tests\" that will be available \"early next week.\"\n\n\"Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of this virus and help Americans impacted by this,\" he said. \"Again, we don't want everyone to take the test.\"\n\nHe added: \"This will pass...It's going to pass through...and we'll be all the stronger for it.\"\n\nThe president also went on to announce that he would waive interest on federally held student loans and moved to prop up energy markets, by directing the Department of Energy to buy oil to fill the strategic petroleum reserve \"'right up to the top.\"\n\nWHAT AN EMERGENCY DECLARATION MEANS\n\nMeanwhile, the president said he would ask hospitals across the nation to activate their \"emergency preparedness plans,\" and said his designation of a national emergency would allow HHS Secretary Alexander Azar to waive \"provisions of applicable laws and regulations\" to give medical professionals and hospitals the \"flexibility\" to care for all patients.\n\nThe president said that Azar will have the ability to enable \"telehealth\" for remote doctor visit and hospital check-ins, and the ability to waive hospital stay limits, as well as obtain additional office and hospital space.\n\n\"They can now do as they want and do what they have to do, they know what they have to do now, they don't have any problem getting it done,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Trump administration has also partnered with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests available in \"critical locations\" identified by public health professionals, he said.\n\n\"The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,\" Trump said, while thanking Google for creating a website to help implement the drive-through test taking technology.\n\nTrump said Google was going to \"very quickly\" get the website \"done, unlike websites in the past,\" he said in a veiled and apparent swipe at the Obama administration's roll-out of healthcare.gov. \"Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now,\" Trump said.\n\nBut that wasn't his only swipe at the Obama administration Friday. Trump was asked about the H1N1 pandemic--which former President Barack Obama declared a national emergency over in 2009.\n\n\"It was nothing like this and they actually lost approx 14,000 people,\" Trump said, slamming the Obama administration for thinking about testing \"far too late.\"\n\n\"We've done it very early and we've also kept a lot of people out,\" Trump said.\n\nIn response to a question, reminding Trump that the past administration had tested \"1 million people,\" he replied: \"They had a very big failure with swine flu. Very big failure.\"\n\nIn recent days, major sporting and other events were called off or postponed, businesses across the country instituted telework policies, government buildings and schools shuttered and other disruptions rock the nation, amid efforts to curb the transmission of the virus.\n\n\"We have to make short term sacrifices which will produce long term gains,\" Trump said, while praising the cancellation of national sporting leagues as having done \"a great service.\"\n\n\"We're with you every step of the way. No nation is more prepared or more equipped to face this, as you know,\" Trump said. \"With faith and heart and hope, we will succeeed and we will prevail. We will be very, very successful and learn for the future.\"\n\nEvery U.S. president since 1976 has declared at least one national emergency. Former President Obama declared an emergency in 2009 over the H1N1 influenza pandemic and former President George W. Bush declared two national emergencies in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks.\n\nTrump's announcement Friday also comes amid conflicting reports over whether another person who came in contact with Trump in recent days -- Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro -- tested positive.\n\nThe president, decisively, told reporters that he does not have any symptoms of coronavirus, or COVID-19.\n\n\"I don't have any of the symptoms...White House doctors, and there are a lot of them, say you don't have any symptoms whatsoever,\" Trump said. \"And we don't want people without symptoms to go out and do the test.\"\n\nHe added: \"The test is not insignificant.\"\n\nThe announcement of the national emergency also comes after the World Health Organization designated coronavirus, or COVID-19, a global pandemic.\n\nFollowing that designation, the president announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, excluding flights from the United Kingdom and those carrying cargo, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.\n\n\"As you know, Europe was just designated as the hot spot right now and we closed it,\" Trump said Friday, questioning whether it was a matter of \"talent or through luck\" to act early.\n\n\"Call it whatever you want,\" Trump said, noting any families returning from Europe \"will be subject to extra screening or a period of isolation for 14 days.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brooke_singman@foxnews.com", "name": "Brooke Singman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Disaster_Relief_and_Emergency_Assistance_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Rose_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Rose Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus disease 2019"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Emergencies Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H1N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Republicans have said the information could contain damaging evidence of the younger Biden's overseas business dealings and possible corruption.\n\n\"Defendant's wife's due date is imminent,\" Biden's request for continuance reads. \"Defendant will supplement this motion as soon as possible with an affidavit of his wife's treating physician.\"\n\nAdditionally, \"it is unsafe for the Defendant to travel, as travel restrictions have been implemented both domestically and internationally, particularly on airlines, due to the Coronavirus. Setting aside personal endangerment, Defendant reasonably believes that such travel unnecessarily exposes his wife and unborn child to this virus.\"\n\nCoverage from various media outlets -- including Fox News, The New York Times, NPR and The New York Post -- has led to \"physical risks and logistics difficulties with travel to Arkansas,\" the motion continues.\n\nIt notes that Biden has already agreed to pay an undisclosed monthly amount of child support, retroactive to November 2018. That agreement came only after Independence County Circuit Court Judge Holly Meyer threatened to hold him in contempt, and led to a brief suspension in contempt proceedings. However, Meyer emphasized that she still had \"insufficient\" documentation to determine Biden's financial capacity to support the child.\n\nREAD BIDEN'S MOTION; BIDEN DENIES CONTEMPT MOTION\n\nAs something of an olive branch, Biden's team notes in its new motion that it \"has no objection to entry of an order continuing the temporary support for another nine months and rescheduling the deposition and hearing at the end of that period\" -- this would be after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe lawyers are also offering to attend an upcoming hearing by phone and to appear for the deposition by videoconference.\n\nThe gambit faces a skeptical judge, who has already voiced doubt about repeated delays in the case.\n\n\"He needs to make himself available unless his hair is on fire,\" Meyer said during a conference call with the attorneys on the case last month, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN IN FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF PREVIOUS COURT ORDER, CONTEMPT MOTION SAYS\n\nLast Friday, a blistering new filing from the mother of Biden's child in the paternity case argued that Biden should be held in contempt for continuing to defy a court order to turn over his financial information, flaunting his lack of \"respect\" for the legal process and undermining the interests of the child he has previously refused to support or even acknowledge.\n\nThe motions come as Joe Biden has surged to front-runner status in the Democrats' presidential primary amid new questions over whether his son may have wrongly benefited from his father's position as vice president. The case threatens to surface new information about the younger Biden's overseas dealings in Ukraine, China and elsewhere during the Obama administration -- and the extent of his father's knowledge of those arrangements.\n\n\"After months of hiding, one has to wonder if the reason Hunter Biden continues to defy the court is because there are financial documents that could shed light on his father's massive conflicts of interest as vice president,\" Republican National Committee (RNC) spokesman Steve Guest told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nThe previous filing from 28-year-old Lunden Alexis Roberts' legal team wasted little time in charging that Hunter Biden \"continues to act as though he has no respect for this Court, its orders, the legal process in this state, or the needs of his child for support.\" It argues that the court \"should take some action that will make the defendant follow court orders and a believer in the rule of law.\"\n\nSpecifically, Hunter Biden has not turned over information concerning his address, financial institutions he or his businesses use, a list of all the companies he \"currently owns or in which he has an ownership interest and the state in which those companies are incorporated,\" or a list of \"all sources of income for the past five years.\"\n\nHUNTER BIDEN'S SCANDALS EXPLAINED: COCAINE, UKRAINE, AND MORE\n\nAdditionally, the younger Biden has failed to produce a list of all \"employers for the past five years,\" an unredacted copy of his tax returns, deeds for properties he owns and tax documents for companies in which he has any ownership interest.\n\nIn his denial of the contempt motion, Hunter Biden said he had \"provided the 2017 and 2018 personal tax returns\" to the plaintiff in the case, and insisted that he had provided sufficient \"updated financial information and documents through counsel.\"\n\nHe further argued he wasn't given sufficient notice of the deposition under Arkansas rules of civil procedure.\n\nThe previous judge in the case, Don McSpadden, said in December that Hunter Biden was \"going to have to provide at least the last three years of tax returns.\" A Dec. 4 court order required Hunter Biden to turn over at a minimum \"five most recent paystubs or five previous years\" of tax returns, and a later order mandated both sides provide \"their personal tax returns for the past five years; and ... any and all financial documents and information showing money or monies they received in the past five years.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeyer, who now oversees the case, has said those orders are still in effect. Meyer had previously ordered Hunter Biden to appear in person for the same reason, but he temporarily avoided being held in contempt when he agreed to pay the monthly child support amount. At the time, Meyer noted she \"lacks sufficient information\" about Hunter Biden's finances to determine the appropriate child support totals, and temporarily delayed contempt proceedings until March 1.\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that the 50-year-old Hunter Biden is spending his time attempting to pass himself off as a painter in a rented $12,000-per-month hideout in Hollywood Hills while driving a Porsche.\n\nThe paternity case established that Hunter Biden was the father of Roberts' baby after a DNA test. Roberts had argued that Biden was essentially an absent father, and the younger Biden had repeatedly denied paternity until the DNA test.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news",

It sent a scathing letter to Twitter earlier this week after the company labeled one of its videos \"manipulated media.\"\n\nThe slickly edited video, which Biden tweeted on Super Tuesday, contrasts Biden's message of \"hope over fear\" against a litany of claims and comments Trump has made over the years. The Post took issue with the Biden campaign's presentation of two of those moments in particular -- a Trump quote on the coronavirus and one on the American dream.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nTRUMP CAMP FIRES BACK AFTER TWITTER LABELS BIDEN VIDEO 'MANIPULATED'\n\n\"Coronavirus -- this is their new hoax,\" the video shows Trump saying at a campaign rally in South Carolina.\n\nThe president did not say \"this is their new hoax\" immediately after he said \"coronavirus\" in his original comments, as the ad makes it appear, but rather made the hoax comment several sentences later. Trump was still talking about the coronavirus when he said the \"hoax\" part of the comment, but it was in reference to the media and how it covered his impeachment trial.\n\nThe Post takes issue with the edit, saying that it is misleading. Trump has misled about his administration's response to the coronavirus, the Post claimed, \"But that does not excuse this kind of video manipulation. This is a clear example of deceptive editing, specifically what we label 'omission.'\"\n\nThe next claim the Post fact-checks is a video of Trump hugging an American flag, which is paired with audio of the president saying \"the American dream ... is dead.\"\n\nBut, the Post explains, Trump promised to bring back the American Dream immediately after he said \"the American dream is dead,\" which the Biden campaign left out.\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT SUMMONS CHINESE AMBASSADOR OVER 'BLATANT' DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN ON CORONAVIRUS\n\n\"The message is unarguably bleak, but by failing to include the second half of Trump's repeated line, it isolates the comment from the context of Trump's political argument,\" the Post's fact-check says. \"Moreover, the ad does not make clear that the clip is nearly five years old, ignoring the difference between when a candidate and a sitting president makes a provocative, political statement like this.\"\n\nThe Post, in its four-Pinnochio fact-check, says this edit in the Biden ad constitutes \"missing context.\"\n\nBoth the Trump presidential campaign and the Republican Party were quick to tout the paper's reprimand to the Biden campaign.\n\n\"Like Biden's repeated gaffes, Biden's penchant for lying and politicizing President Trump's response to coronavirus is a pattern,\" GOP Rapid Response Director Steve Guest said in a statement. \"Nevertheless, while Biden keeps smearing President Trump, the Trump administration is continuing to take aggressive action with their coronavirus response.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign's rapid response director, Matt Wolking, demanded in a statement that Twitter respond to the Post's fact-check.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Now that an independent, third-party fact-checker has ruled the Biden video is manipulated to deceive, Twitter must immediately say whether it meets their 'manipulated video' standard, and if it does, treat it the same way Twitter treated President Trump's campaign,\" he said.\n\nBut Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates, in a comment to the Washington Post, said the ad successfully emphasized Trump's lack of credibility and highlighted his mistruths.\n\n\"Donald Trump is the most dishonest president in American history and one of the least credible human beings in the world. We don't trust his next-day cleanup attempt, and he has made many comments in that same vein,\" he said. \"And the claim that the American Dream was 'dead' in the final year of the Obama administration -- during the longest streak of job growth in American history -- is categorically untrue and another reminder of Donald Trump's deep cynicism.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_olson@foxnews.com", "name": "Tyler Olson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hoax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Tuesday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment of Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Video_Editing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Video Editing", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/b24ca948-f6ba-4400-86e4-ad38c69c7cb8/f95e4d27-3863-483a-9775-f0c5f62d7f00/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "eventUri": "eng-5590141", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 8061, "pinterest": 21}, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 8082, "relevance": 101}], "totalResults": 726, "page": 1, "count": 25, "pages": 30}}
