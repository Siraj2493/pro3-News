Sign up here.\n\nA $250 billion urgent request to shore up a depleting small business fund failed to pass the Senate Thursday after Democrats objected to the measure pushed by the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nWith lawmakers home and social distancing, McConnell sought to pass the cash infusion swiftly Thursday by unanimous consent with a skeleton group of senators, but Democrats blocked the effort because they want add-ons to help businesses in disadvantaged communities and an additional $250 billion in funds for other priorities.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS SWELL AS CORONAVIRUS PARALYZES US ECONOMY\n\nThe extra funding is being sought amid concerns that the original $350 billion program to help businesses stay afloat during the coronavirus pandemic could run dry in the near future in the face of an enormous demand.\n\nThe stalemate in the Senate comes as a record-breaking number of Americans have filed for unemployment with the economy shutting down nationwide under stay-at-home orders. New jobless numbers out Thursday morning show a total of 16.8 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the last three weeks.\n\nLAWMAKERS SCRAMBLE TO REACH A DEAL TO PUMP UP SMALL BUSINESS CORONAVIRUS FUND\n\nMcConnell pleaded with Democrats to pass a measure that would change the funding for the program from $350 billion to $600 billion total in a \"clean\" emergency measure.\n\n\"This does not have to be nor should it be contentious,\" McConnell said, adding that lawmakers can always return to pass other legislation.\n\n\"To my Democratic colleagues, please do not block emergency aid you do not even oppose just because you want something more,\" McConnell pleaded.\n\nBut Democrats say they've got a better plan, and want additional provisions and protections to help businesses in disadvantaged communities. Their proposal would cost roughly double the Republicans' and include an additional $100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion more for state and local governments as well as increases to food assistance benefits.\n\nDemocrats called McConnell's move a \"political stunt\" because the Senate leader knew his plan didn't have bipartisan support but put it forward anyway, knowing it would fail.\n\n\"I'm afraid that this unanimous consent is basically a political stunt because it will not address the immediate need of small businesses in the legislation that we have passed,\" Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said.\n\nMNUCHIN SPEAKS WITH CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS ABOUT ADDITIONAL $250B FOR PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM\n\nDemocrats said small businesses have been seeking fixes in the loan program already that could have garnered bipartisan support if McConnell had worked with them.\n\n\"Yes, we know we need more money for this program,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. \"But for goodness sakes, let's take the opportunity to make some bipartisan fixes to allow this program to work better for the very people it's designed to help -- small businesses, nonprofits. That's what they are asking us to do.\"\n\nDuring a brief Senate session Thursday morning, McConnell sought unanimous consent for the small business funding boost. But Cardin objected. And McConnell formally rejected the Democrats' alternative proposal -- creating an impasse.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd even if it had passed the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned Wednesday the narrow McConnell plan couldn't pass the House by unanimous consent. Meanwhile, Kentucky GOP Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., again threatened to block anything passing the House during the pandemic without lawmakers returning to Washington to vote in person.\n\nThe disarray at the Capitol leaves small business owners in the balance as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warns the popular program is on track to be depleted as struggling businesses rush to apply for aid.\n\nThe Paycheck Protection Program helps businesses with under 500 employees apply for loans to cover eight weeks of their payroll, benefit and rent expenses.\n\nThe loans will be converted to grants and fully forgiven if 75 percent of the loan is used to keep employees on the payroll. The program was created as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act that passed last month.\n\nMcConnell said at least $100 billion in loans for small businesses -- roughly 30 percent of the fund -- has already been approved under the program since it started accepting applications April 3.\n\nMcConnell accused Democrats of trying to hold paychecks \"hostage\" and blasted them for trying to push programs that have \"zero\" chance of passing the House and Senate.\n\n\"The country cannot afford unnecessary wrangling or political maneuvering,\" McConnell said.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com",

coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nThe federal government is classifying the deaths of patients infected with the coronavirus as COVID-19 deaths, regardless of any underlying health issues that could have contributed to the loss of someone's life.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, said the federal government is continuing to count the suspected COVID-19 deaths, despite other nations doing the opposite.\n\n\"There are other countries that if you had a pre-existing condition, and let's say the virus caused you to go to the ICU [intensive care unit] and then have a heart or kidney problem,\" she said during a Tuesday news briefing at the White House. \"Some countries are recording that as a heart issue or a kidney issue and not a COVID-19 death.\n\n\"The intent is ... if someone dies with COVID-19 we are counting that,\" she added.\n\nAsked whether the numbers could skew data the government is trying to collect, Birx said that would mostly apply more to rural areas where testing isn't being implemented on a wide scale.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident that in New York City and New Jersey and places that have these large outbreaks and COVID-only hospitals. ... I can tell you they are testing,\" she said.\n\nDr. Michael Baden, a Fox News contributor, said it's reasonable to include the death of someone infected with the virus, who also had other health issues, in the COVID-19 body count.\n\n\"In the normal course, autopsies would then determine whether the person died of the effects of the COVID virus, whether the person had a brain tumor or brain hemorrhage for example that might be unrelated to it and what the relative significance of both the infection and the pre-existing disease is,\" Baden told Fox News.\n\nHowever, the number of autopsies being performed could be low due to the danger of infection, he said.\n\n\"Then you will include in those numbers some people who did have a pre-existing condition that would have caused death anyway, but that's probably a small number,\" Baden said.\n\nThe United States had 398,185 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday night, including more than 12,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nPresident Trump spent Monday trying to assure Americans that the U.S. and health facilities are prepared for a possible surge in cases in the coming weeks.\n\n\"Progress has been made before the surge,\" Trump said during the White House coronavirus briefing where he said hospitals will be stockpiled with much-needed equipment. \"The next week, week and half is when the big surge is going to come.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "louis_casiano@foxnews.com", "name": "Louis Casiano", "type": "author",

Sign up here.\n\nIn 2006, then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration began purchasing ventilators to allow the city to be prepared for a pandemic like the current coronavirus crisis -- only for the city to later auction them off, according to a report.\n\nProPublica reported Monday that the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a report in 2006 on the city's preparedness for pandemic influenza -- similar to the 1918 Spanish Flu or the 2019 novel coronavirus -- that projected the city would need thousands of extra ventilators in order to properly treat all of its residents who got sick. The plan was then put into action, with the city initially buying 500 ventilators before it ran out of money to buy more and to maintain the ones it had already stockpiled, according to ProPublica.\n\nThose ventilators were then auctioned off some time before 2016 because the city could not afford to maintain them in working order, partially because the model of ventilator the city had purchased was no longer in production after 2009, the report said.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nTRUMP MAKES LAST-MINUTE PUSH FOR WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT JUSTICE STATE HOLDS ELECTION DURING PANDEMIC\n\n\"We tried to fill in the gap as best we could,\" Dr. Issac Weisfuse, the former deputy commissioner of the city's health department, told ProPublica.\n\n\"This was beyond our control but had a direct impact on cost and viability of maintaining a stockpile,\" Michael Lanza, the current assistant press secretary for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said according to ProPublica.\n\nThe outlet also reported that New York City set out to purchase over one million N95 face masks -- the type suggested for use to protect against the coronavirus -- in order to distribute them to health professionals. It purchased less than one-quarter of that and the masks all eventually expired.\n\nThe city's shortage of supplies when coronavirus hit -- which was similar to many places across the country, including the federal government -- has led to a scramble for ventilators and masks by current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who are requesting tens of thousands of ventilators for the city and state as a whole. The 2006 report commissioned by the Bloomberg administration appeared to preview such a scenario.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"A conservative-to-moderate estimate assumes that 25 percent of admitted patients requiring ICU care (with 50 percent of those receiving ICU care requiring ventilation)\" would cause the city to fall somewhere between about 250 and 1,300 ventilators short of what it would need, according to the 2006 report obtained by ProPublica.\n\n\"Using the same assumptions for a projected 1918-like pandemic, produces a projected shortfall of between 2,036 and 9,454 ventilators,\" the report continues. \"Based upon these numbers alone, it is important to consider augmenting existing ventilator capacity for adults, children, and neonates in NYC.\"\n\nDe Blasio's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, New York state had 123,160 confirmed coronavirus cases out of 337,933 total in the United States, and New York had recorded at least 5,489 deaths, up from 4,758 on Monday.

and air-borne particles.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nResearchers in Finland have created a chilling video that models how coronavirus could spread from a single cough in a supermarket.\n\nThe video was uploaded to YouTube by scientists at Finland's Aalto University. \"In the 3D model, a person coughs in a corridor bounded by shelves under representative indoor ventilation airflow conditions,\" the video explains. \"As a result of coughing, an aerosol cloud travels in the air to the corridor. It takes up to several minutes for the cloud to spread and disperse.\"\n\n\"Preliminary results indicate that aerosol particles carrying the virus can remain in the air longer than was originally thought, so it is important to avoid busy public indoor spaces,\" the researchers explain in a statement. \"This also reduces the risk of droplet infection, which remains the main path of transmission for coronavirus.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS PARTICLES COULD STAY IN AIR FOR 'SEVERAL MINUTES' INDOORS, RESEARCHERS WARN\n\nAs of Thursday morning, at least 1.5 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, 2,605 of which are in Finland. The disease has accounted for at least 89,915 deaths around the world, including 42 people in Finland.\n\nIn their study, the researchers modeled the airborne movement of aerosol particles smaller than 20 micrometers, noting that the particle size for a dry cough is typically less than 15 micrometers.\n\n\"Extremely small particles of this size do not sink on the floor, but instead, move along in the air currents or remain floating in the same place,\" they said in the statement.\n\nINDOOR HUMIDITY MAY SLOW CORONAVIRUS SPREAD, YALE SCIENTISTS SAY\n\nA supercomputer at CSC, which is the Finnish IT Center for Science, and 3D-visualization technology, were used in the research.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently recommended wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores and pharmacies. This is particularly important \"in areas of significant community-based transmission,\" the CDC said.\n\nThe research was undertaken by experts from Finland's Aalto University, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, and the University of Finland.\n\nHOW CORONAVIRUS IS IMPACTING POLLUTION ACROSS THE GLOBE\n\nExperts studied how small airborne aerosol particles are transported in the air when emitted from the respiratory tract when sneezing, coughing or even talking.\n\n\"The researchers modeled a scenario where a person coughs in an aisle between shelves, like those found in grocery stores; and taking into consideration the ventilation,\" they said in the statement. Each research institution performed its modeling independently but employed the same starting conditions.\n\nThe researchers all obtained the same preliminary result.\n\nMORE THAN 100 YEARS BEFORE CORONAVIRUS, THE SPANISH FLU PANDEMIC RAVAGED THE GLOBE\n\n\"In the situation under investigation, the aerosol cloud spreads outside the immediate vicinity of the coughing person and dilutes in the process,\" they explained, in the statement. \"However, this can take up to several minutes.\"\n\nThe study could have major implications for the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\"Someone infected by the coronavirus, can cough and walk away, but then leave behind extremely small aerosol particles carrying the coronavirus,\" explained Aalto University Assistant Professor Ville Vuorinen in the statement. \"These particles could then end up in the respiratory tract of others in the vicinity.\"\n\nAt least 432,554 coronavirus cases have been diagnosed in the U.S. and the disease has accounted

Last week, the Netherlands also rejected China-made coronavirus testing kits and protective gear, calling them substandard and questioning the quality of supplies Beijing is selling to the world.\n\nTurkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have also spoken out about kits it purchased from China as being less than adequate.

This is an amazing achievement, which gives us all reassurance that the #coronavirus can be beaten.\"\n\nThat tweet came amid allegations that the coronavirus numbers reported by China were not accurate, but manipulated to make the country's response to the pandemic look stronger than it was.\n\nCommunications from the World Health Organization have been used by China to boost the nation's message as it seeks to deflect blame for the pandemic, which a study by the University of Southampton claims could have been \"reduced by 95 percent globally\" if China acted three weeks earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, are among the American politicians calling for the WHO leader to face accountability for how his organization has performed during the pandemic.\n\n\"Once this pandemic is under control, WHO leadership should be held to account. That includes Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has allowed Beijing to use the WHO to mislead the global community,\" Rubio said. \"At this moment, [Tedros] is either complicit or dangerously incompetent. Neither possibility bodes well for his future at the helm of this critical organization.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Cruz doubled down on calls, saying that the WHO should consider removing Tedros as its head.\n\n\"Sen. Cruz believes that the WHO has lost the credibility necessary for it to be effective, and a reevaluation of its leadership is urgently called for,\" the spokesperson told The Washington Free Beacon.\n\nMCSALLY SAYS WHO BOSS SHOULD RESIGN OVER CHINA 'COVER-UP'\n\nThe United States is the single largest contributor to the WHO. The most recent invoice from the WHO to the United States, which is one of many countries that fund the organization, was for nearly $116 million per year. The United States also voluntarily gives between approximately $100 million and $400 million more per year to the WHO for specific projects -- contributions that totaled over $400 million in 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available.\n\nThat means the United States contributed over $500 million in total to the WHO that year, which is just under one-quarter of the organization's yearly budget. The WHO's total budget for 2016 and 2017 combined was over $4 billion.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the number of coronavirus cases worldwide had surpassed 1.3 million, with more than 75,900 deaths, with the United States reporting more than 368,400 positive cases of COVID-19 and nearly 11,000 deaths.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brooke_singman@foxnews.com", "name": "Brooke Singman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bolton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Bolton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tedros Adhanom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Sign up here.\n\nRepublicans on the House Oversight Committee are demanding that the management of the Kennedy Center explain themselves after announcing the furlough of employees -- after a controversial $25 million provision in the CARES Act coronavirus stimulus was meant to keep staffers employed.\n\nAfter Democrats came under fire for successfully pushing for the center's bailout, the organization announced that it is furloughing nearly 60 percent of its full-time administrative staff from April 6 to at least May 10, and that this is \"apart from the 725 hourly and part-time employees already impacted.\"\n\nGOP SEEKS TO CLAW BACK KENNEDY CENTER'S $25M STIMULUS PAYOUT, AS OPERA HOUSE CONTINUES LAYOFFS\n\nIn a letter Tuesday to Kennedy Center Director Timothy O'Leary, the GOP representatives demanded answers and the return of at least some of the funding they just received.\n\n\"These layoffs, whether temporary or not, are counter to the spirit of the CARES Act and are concerning to Congress,\" the letter said, later adding that \"[i]f the Kennedy Center is required to furlough its employees, it should return a portion of money Democrats fought so hard to secure.\"\n\nThese furloughs were on top of what was going to be an additional furlough of musicians with the National Symphony Orchestra. According to the Washington Post, the Kennedy Center announced Tuesday that they reached a deal with the orchestra to avoid furloughs, but that musicians will take a significant pay cut at least through September.\n\nThe Republicans claimed that the center's actions prove that skepticism over the $25 million payout to the center was \"well-founded.\"\n\n\"The public's perception is that the Kennedy Center leadership took taxpayer funding and left their employees holding the bag,\" Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, said in a statement. \"Congress, and more importantly the public, deserves answers to the questionable decisions made to furlough employees after receiving funding to prevent that.\"\n\nGibbs signed the letter along with Reps. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C.; Ralph Norman, R-S.C.; Carol Miller, W.Va.; Mark Green, R-Tenn.; Greg Steube, R-Fla.; Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., and Fred Keller, R-Pa.\n\nThe letter further demanded that the center provide information in the form of a briefing that addresses why they needed to go through with \"any and all furloughs, layoffs, or reductions in pay,\" a plan to prevent further similar measures, and a \"delineated explanation of expenses\" for the center.\n\nLISTEN TO THE FULL AUDIO, APPEARING TO SHOW KENNEDY CENTER PRESIDENT PLANNING LAYOFFS\n\nThe letter comes a week after two Republican congressmen introduced legislation to reclaim the $25 million allocated to the center in the CARES Act.\n\nThe Kennedy Center released a breakdown of how it was using the money, stating that $12,750,000 was going to employees' pay; $7,500,000 to employee benefits, and $1,750,000 for artists' contracts and fees. Of the remaining money, $1 million was marked for rent and utilities; $750,000 for information technology plus $250,000 for IT improvements on \"telework capacity;\" $250,000 for cleaning and $750,000 for \"Other Admin Expenses.\"\n\nPresident Trump, speaking at a White House coronavirus briefing last month, had said that he understood the Kennedy Center funding was necessary because Democrats demanded some concessions in order to get the stimulus bill passed, even though he recognized that it galled some conservatives. The provision first appeared in a version of the stimulus bill authored by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\nRep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis. -- who introduced the bill to retract the funding along with numerous cosponsors, before the layoffs happened -- said the bailout was always a \"mistake.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKeller called the $25 million payout \"unconscionable\" given the current state of the economy.\n\n\"What's worse, the Kennedy Center took the government's money and laid off all their workers and musicians,\" Keller said in a statement. \"This is an affront to the spirit of Congress' relief effort and tantamount to a fleecing of the American taxpayer.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ronn_blitzer@foxnews.com", "name": "Ronn Blitzer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Sign up here.\n\nAs daily life across America is upended by the coronavirus crisis -- with mass business closures plunging the economy into freefall -- one former New York Times reporter is sounding the alarm about what he believes are flawed models dictating the aggressive strategy.\n\nAlex Berenson has been analyzing the data on the crisis on a daily basis for weeks and has come to the conclusion that the strategy of shutting down entire sectors of the economy is based on modeling that doesn't line up with the realities of the virus.\n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK STATE BY STATE\n\n\"The response we have taken has caused enormous societal devastation, I don't think that's too strong a word,\" he told Fox News in an interview Thursday.\n\nBerenson is a former reporter who worked for the Times from 1999 to 2010 primarily covering the pharmaceutical industry. He recently came to prominence again with a book, \"Tell Your Children The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence,\" which challenged prevailing narratives on marijuana.\n\n'The response we have taken has caused enormous societal devastation.'\n\n-- Alex Berenson\n\nIn the face of a broadening consensus on both the left and the libertarian right that sees marijuana as mostly healthy and even a positive in some circumstances, Berenson argued that the evidence instead shows a link between the drug and serious mental illness and an epidemic of violence.\n\nNow he's turned to challenging the narratives on the response to the coronavirus. What Berenson is promoting isn't coronavirus denialism, or conspiracy theories about plots to curb liberties. Instead what Berenson is claiming is simple: the models guiding the response were wrong and that it is becoming clearer by the day.\n\n\"In February I was worried about the virus. By mid-March I was more scared about the economy. But now I'm starting to get genuinely nervous,\" he tweeted this week. \"This isn't complicated. The models don't work. The hospitals are empty. WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT INDEFINITE LOCKDOWNS?\"\n\nHospitals, of course, are not empty in places like hard-hit New York City, and tales are widespread of overburdened doctors and emergency rooms. Berenson acknowledged as much in the interview Thursday.\n\nConcerns that this virus is significantly more contagious and deadly than any ordinary flu strain are what's driving the current government approach, in America and around the world. Perhaps due in part to more testing, America reports the highest number of cases in the world right now, with more than 430,000 cases and nearly 15,000 deaths. Symptoms vary widely, with some patients reporting only minor discomfort yet others dealing with crushing physical pain and struggling to breathe, forced to go on ventilators.\n\nBut Berenson is taking a broader look. He initially challenged the model put forward by the Imperial College in London, when one of the authors of the models appeared to significantly walk back projections that the U.K. would see 500,000 people killed by the disease to closer to 20,000 -- although the author later said that the 500,000 prediction was without social distancing measures, and 20,000 was with them in place. That model is being used to advise the U.K. government on its strategy for the virus.\n\n\"That was March 22 or 23, and ever since then I've been paying incredibly close attention to the modeling and trying to figure out whether it lines up with what we're seeing in reality -- and the answer is it hasn't lined up at all,\" he said.\n\nRecently he's been focusing on discrepancies within the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model. That model has come under renewed scrutiny as it has revised its metrics multiple times. It once predicted more than 90,000 deaths by August but recently issued a new estimate that has the figure closer to 60,000. Government officials say it's a model that's moving with what the country is doing.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON ON THE CORONAVIRUS MODELS: WHY HAVE THEY BEEN SO WRONG?\n\n\"We believe that our health care delivery system in the United States is quite extraordinary,\" Dr. Deborah Birx said at a White House press briefing on Wednesday. \"I know many of you are watching the Act Now model and the IHME model -- and they have consistently decreased the number, the mortality from over almost 90,000 or 86,000, down to 81,000 and now down to 61,000. That is modeled on what America is doing. That's what's happening.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci said that the indicators are that social distancing efforts are working: \"Because remember, what you do with data will always outstrip a model. You redo your models, depending upon your data, and our data is telling us that mitigation is working.\"\n\nBut Berenson argues that those models have social distancing and other measures baked into them. As for further proof, he says that outside of places like New York there has not been a national health crisis that was predicted -- nor are there signs that the level of lockdown in various states has made a difference.\n\n\"Aside from New York, nationally there's been no health system crisis. In fact, to be truly correct there has been a health system crisis, but the crisis is that the hospitals are empty,\" he said. \"This is true in Florida where the lockdown was late, this is true in southern California where the lockdown was early, it's true in Oklahoma where there is no statewide lockdown. There doesn't seem to be any correlation between the lockdown and whether or not the epidemic has spread wide and fast.\"\n\nHe has also argued, in lengthy Twitter threads, that the drop in cases seen in various states has come before lockdowns would have had an impact -- since it takes a few weeks for social distancing measures to take effect due to the window between infection and symptoms.\n\nBerenson blames the models for a response that has effectively shut down large sectors of the economy and is causing significant financial harm to Americans. On Thursday it was announced that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits swelled to 6.6 million last week, surging for the third consecutive week. Congress has sought to alleviate the pain by boosting those jobless benefits.\n\nHis is a view that has seen some sympathy from President Trump, who has spoken about the \"cure being worse than the problem\" and has indicated that he is keen to end the strict measures as soon as is possible -- saying Wednesday he wants to re-open the economy with a \"big bang.\"\n\nBerenson says the correct response in the initial days of the crisis would not have been to do nothing, but instead to adopt a more measured and targeted approach.\n\n\"There was incredible pressure to do something ... so these lockdowns all cascaded, every governor tried to outdo the next. And no one stopped and said 'OK what about Japan, they don't seem to have a terrible epidemic, they wear masks, maybe we should wear masks,\" he said.\n\nHe said other measures such as protecting individuals particularly at risk, and even things such as banning large gatherings such as concerts and sporting events could have been appropriate. But now he fears it may be too late for officials to say they overreacted.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"Now we're in a bad spot because there's clearly a dangerous political dynamic right now -- the economy is in freefall, a lot of people are hurting. If we acknowledge what is clearly happening ... the people who made these decisions, I think there's going to be a lot of anger at them, so they don't want to acknowledge it, so they say 'oh it's the lockdown that saved us,'\" he says.\n\nBerenson is not a known partisan.

Tavia Galonski tweeted Sunday after President Trump spoke about hydroxychloroquine at his daily press briefing. The drug, normally used to treat malaria, is one of several that the president has pointed to as showing promise in the fight against COVID-19, but its effectiveness has been a subject of debate.\n\nGIULIANI SAYS DOCTORS, NOT 'NATIONAL BUREAUCRACY,' SHOULD DECIDE WHETHER TO USE HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE FOR CORONAVIRUS\n\n\"I can't take it anymore. I've been to The Hague. I'm making a referral for crimes against humanity tomorrow,\" Galonski said. \"Today's press conference was the last straw. I know the need for a prosecution referral when I see one.\"\n\nThe Hague is the site of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which boasts 123 state parties. The United States is not one of them. Only member states or non-members who accept the ICC's jurisdiction can make referrals. Alternatively, the United Nations Security Council can also refer a matter for investigation.\n\n\"Crimes against humanity\" is a category of offense that the ICC handles. The court provides a list of crimes that fall under this, including murder, extermination, enslavement, torture, and \"other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering or serious bodily or mental injury.\"\n\nFox News asked Rep. Galonski if there is a specific crime she is accusing Trump of committing, and how she plans on pursuing charges given the United States' non-member status. She did not immediately respond.\n\nGalonski is not the only one to question Trump's promotion of hydroxychloroquine, given that the FDA has not approved it -- or any other drugs -- specifically for treating COVID-19.\n\nCLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\nMany governors, public-health officials, and others have warned that the drug has shown major side effects and its efficacy still remained unproven as a treatment for COVID-19. Some experts have expressed concern that widespread use of the drug could lead to complicating access for people who need them for rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.\n\nThere have been instances of doctors saying they have had success with it, but Dr. Antony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the data is \"at best suggestive.\"\n\nFauci said he does not think \"we could definitely say it works,\" noting that in some cases there has been \"no effect,\" and in others it may have been effective.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen Fauci was asked about the drug at Sunday's press briefing, Trump said, \"He's answered that question 15 times.\"\n\nDespite the apparent inconclusiveness one way or the other about the drug, Galonski appears confident that she has grounds to bring a case against the president, and is calling on attorneys with international experience to reach out and help her.\n\nFox

Bernie Sanders ending his 2020 campaign.\n\nApproval of President Trump's job performance inches up to a record high in the latest Fox News Poll, as voters rally to both the White House and Congress in the fight against coronavirus.\n\nAmid widespread concerns about the virus's spread and personally getting infected, 49 percent approve of the job Trump is doing as president. That's up from 48 percent two weeks ago and 47 percent in late February.\n\nForty-nine percent of voters disapprove, marking only the third time in Fox News polling that fewer than half rate him negatively.\n\nEighty-nine percent of Republicans approve of Trump, which is not far from his record 91 percent in January. In addition, approval sits at or near his best among women, Democrats, whites, and white evangelical Christians.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE POLL RESULTS\n\nVoters give Congress an even bigger ratings bump than the president: 35 percent approve of the job lawmakers are doing, up four points since March and up nine since late February.\n\nOn responding to the pandemic, 51 percent approve of Trump. But it's Dr. Anthony Fauci who gets the best ratings of those tested, as 80 percent approve of him, while 62 percent approve of Dr. Deborah Birx and 52 percent Vice President Pence.\n\nBy a 21-point margin, voters are more likely to approve of how their state government (77 percent) is handling the pandemic than the federal government (56 percent).\n\nTrump's rating on the pandemic is dampened by over half (55 percent) thinking the government responded too slowly and nearly half (47 percent) feeling he isn't taking it seriously enough.\n\n\"The president's bump in approval isn't huge, and certainly not on par with the rally effect for George W. Bush after 9/11,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"But it could be consequential that he's closing in on 50 percent, which is critical for his re-election chances.\"\n\nOn specific aspects of dealing with the pandemic, Trump receives his highest score on empathizing with Americans (51 percent) and lowest on understanding the facts (45 percent). About half say he is providing strong leadership (48 percent) and making good policy decisions (47 percent).\n\nConcerns about the virus are high. Fully 94 percent worry about the virus spreading. Seventy-six percent are concerned about catching it, up from 69 percent two weeks ago.\n\nLarge majorities are also concerned about their state running out of medical equipment to treat coronavirus patients (80 percent), being able to access health care services (77 percent), and getting a coronavirus test (75 percent).\n\nTwenty-one percent know someone who has the virus, up from 12 percent two weeks ago. In addition, most, 79 percent, fear they or someone in their family could die from it.\n\nAnd while most expect the worst is still ahead (75 percent), a majority of 57 percent says the country is moving in the right direction in the fight against the pandemic.\n\nBy a 40-point margin, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to think things are going in the right direction on dealing with the pandemic. And by an 18-point margin, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to think the worst is yet to come.\n\nOverall, 8 in 10 favor a national stay-in-place order (80 percent) and requiring some companies temporarily produce medical supplies (84 percent).\n\nViews are more mixed on the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package passed in late March: 39 percent think it was too little, while 39 percent say it was about right. Ten percent say too much. Over twice as many Democrats (56 percent) as Republicans (23 percent) think it was too small.\n\nAlmost all voters are concerned the pandemic will lead to a recession (91 percent), most worry it will lead to economic hardship for their family (79 percent), and half of households (50 percent) have lost a job or had work hours reduced because of coronavirus.\n\nThat leads views on the economy to nose-dive. The number rating the economy positively is down 29 points since January. Now the largest share, 43 percent, say it is in poor shape, the highest level since October 2013.\n\nThese are the worst marks of Trump's tenure, and the decline is due largely to Republicans: 41 percent rate the economy positively (excellent/good), down from 85 percent in January -- a 44-point drop. Among Democrats, the shift was 18 points (from 31 to 13 percent).\n\n\"With this economic implosion so directly linked to coronavirus, the degree to which voters blame Trump for economic conditions will likely be based on whether or not they decide he could have mitigated the pandemic's impact by preparing the country as soon as he was first warned,\" says Anderson.\n\nVoters see things changing soon. Forty-four percent think the economy will get better over the next year, 35 percent see it getting worse, and 16 percent expect no change. More than twice as many Republicans (66 percent) as Democrats (27 percent) see things improving next year.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, 88 percent report changing how they lead their life at least somewhat, including 56 percent who have changed things \"a great deal.\"\n\nMore say their interactions with others feel friendlier and more compassionate (34 percent) these days than less friendly (21 percent). Another one-third say not much difference (35 percent).\n\nWhen asked to share any silver linings in the crisis, top mentions include a sense of community (13 percent), more family time (11 percent), the nation being better prepared for future outbreaks (10 percent), the nation being stronger in the future (8 percent), and time for personal reflection (8 percent). One in five is unable to think of an upside (21 percent).\n\nConducted April 4-7, 2020 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,107 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.

He died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn., where he had been hospitalized last month.\n\nOn March 29, Prine's family shared the star was critically ill and had been placed on a ventilator while being treated for COVID-19-type symptoms.\n\nCELEBRITIES WHO HAVE DIED FROM CORONAVIRUS\n\nA message posted on Prine's Twitter page said the \"Angel from Montgomery\" singer has been hospitalized since March 26 and his condition worsened on March 28.\n\n\"This is hard news for us to share,\" Prine's family said at the time. \"But so many of you have loved and supported John over the years, we wanted to let you know, and give you the chance to send on more of that love and support now.

She said the couple was quarantined and isolated from each other.\n\nPrine had previously fought cancer twice. Most recently, he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2013 and had part of a lung removed.

Ebert went on to write a glowing reveal for the Chicago Sun-Times, which kicked off Prine's musical career.\n\nPrine was previously singing his original songs every Thursday night for about two months. The first three songs Prine ever performed on stage was \"Sam Stone,\" \"Hello in There\" and \"Paradise.\"\n\n\"I sang those three songs and people just sat there and looked at me,\" Prine once recalled. \"I thought, 'Wow, those are really bad.

He's also an uncredited co-writer on \"You Never Even Call Me by My Name\" and his songs have been cut by country stars like Zac Brown Band (\"All the Best\"), Miranda Lambert (\"That's the Way the World Goes Round\") and George Strait (\"I Just Want to Dance with You\").\n\nPrine won his first Grammy for the 1991 album, titled \"The Missing Years.\" He joined the Nashville Hall of Fame in 2003. In addition, the Grammy Hall of Fame inducted his 1971 self-titled album debut in 2014.

Sign up here.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: The majority of eligible Americans will receive their coronavirus aid payments no later than April 15, Fox News has learned.\n\nA senior Treasury official told Fox News on Friday that by the middle of next week, tens of millions of eligible Americans will have money from the federal government directly deposited into their bank accounts.\n\nCORONAVIRUS CHECKS ARE ON THEIR WAY: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS\n\nThe official told Fox News that the Treasury will transmit the batch of payments to the Federal Reserve for distribution to financial institutions across the nation. Those financial institutions will then distribute the payments into Americans' bank accounts.\n\nThe official explained that this first batch of payments will be received by Americans who filed their taxes in 2018 and/or in 2019 and received a refund via direct deposit.\n\nFilers who did not receive a refund electronically in the last tax year will soon be able to expedite their payment by submitting their bank information to the IRS via the \"Get My Payment\" app, which the federal government is launching next week.\n\nThose who do not file taxes are now able to go to the IRS website and use the \"Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here\" section to enter their bank information in order to receive their payment faster than they would via regular mail.\n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, STATE-BY-STATE\n\nThe official said the Treasury Department is also working around the clock to automatically process payments for Social Security and railroad retirement recipients who did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019. Those payments, according to the official, are anticipated in the coming weeks and will primarily be issued electronically.\n\nMeanwhile, millions more economic impact payments will be issued via direct deposit in the coming weeks, as the Treasury issues payments to Social Security recipients, and as other taxpayers provide their banking information on the tools provided through the IRS website and the new app.\n\n\"We are working to secure the fast, secure and efficient delivery of payments to veterans, disabled, and other vulnerable populations,\" the official added.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, officials told Fox News that it took the Obama administration \"several months\" before the first stimulus payments were issued to Americans. The official touted the efficiency of the Trump administration, which is expected to complete this round of payments in weeks.\n\n\"This in and of itself is a major achievement,\" an official told Fox News.\n\nAs part of the CARES Act, people who file their taxes as individuals are eligible for payments up to $1,200, and couples who file jointly are eligible for up to $2,400 plus an additional $500 per child under the age of 17.\n\nThe amount decreases for individuals who earn an adjusted gross income of more than $75,000 and couples who earn more than $150,000 a year, by $5 for every $100 in income above those marks. This means the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for individuals who make $99,000 or more and couples who make $198,000 or more.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nPeople who file as heads of household are eligible for payments of up to $1,200 plus $500 per child under 17. That amount is reduced for people who earn an adjusted gross income of more than $112,000 a year. The extent to which it is decreased depends on how many children they have.\n\nPayment amounts may also be offset by any past due child support payments that have been reported to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe payments do not count as taxable income. Similarly, they do not count for determining eligibility for federal programs like Supplemental Security Income.\n\nFox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brooke_singman@foxnews.com", "name": "Brooke Singman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagen_McDowell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dagen McDowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_return_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax return (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Security (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007\u20132008", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjusted_gross_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adjusted gross income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Security_Income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supplemental Security Income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child support"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/1024/512/AP20093784484015.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "eventUri": "eng-5674545", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 7398, "pinterest": 6}, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 7404, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6025208086", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-08", "time": "18:04:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-08T18:04:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-08T18:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4901960790157318, "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/who-director-hits-back-at-trump-threat-to-defund-agency", "title": "WHO director hits back at Trump threat to defund agency", "body": "The World Health Organization is accused of looking the other way in China's underreporting of coronavirus cases;

Martha McSally, R-Ariz., who last week on Fox Business' \"Mornings with Maria\" told host Maria Bartiromo that she has \"never trusted a communist\" and that the Chinese government's \"cover-up of this virus that originated with them has caused unnecessary deaths around America and around the world...

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said the WHO should consider removing Tedros as its head.\n\n\"The World Health Organization has consistently bent to the will of the Chinese Communist Party at the expense of global health and of containing the spread of the coronavirus, from downplaying the extent of the virus to systematically excluding Taiwan,\" a Cruz spokesperson told the publication. \"Sen. Cruz believes that the WHO has lost the credibility necessary for it to be effective, and a reevaluation of its leadership is urgently called for.\"\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., also told the Free Beacon that \"we need to have a serious reckoning with the World Health Organization.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., joined in on calls for Tedros to face accountability for how his organization has performed during the pandemic.\n\n\"Once this pandemic is under control, WHO leadership should be held to account. That includes Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has allowed Beijing to use the WHO to mislead the global community,\" Rubio said. \" At this moment, [Tedros] is either complicit or dangerously incompetent. Neither possibility bodes well for his future at the helm of this critical organization.\"\n\nSo did former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., the WHO's parent organization, Nikki Haley.\n\n\"This was posted by the WHO on January 14th,\" Haley said of a WHO tweet that cited investigations by Chinese authorities saying the communist nation \"found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\" of the coronavirus.\n\n\"The WHO owes an explanation to the world of why they took China's word for it,\" she continued. \"So much suffering has been caused by the mishandling of information and lack of accountability by the Chinese.\"\n\nBIPARTISAN HOUSE RESOLUTION CONDEMNS CHINESE GOVERNMENT OVER HANDLING OF CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also called for accountability for the WHO on its handling of the coronavirus.\n\n\"When it comes to Coronavirus, the WHO failed. They need to be held accountable for their role in promoting misinformation and helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic,\" Scott said last week. \"We know Communist China is lying about how many cases and deaths they have, what they knew and when they knew it - and the WHO never bothered to investigate further.\"\n\nScott also called for an investigation into the WHO, questioning whether it is deserving of American taxpayer money.\n\nThe United States is the single largest contributor to the WHO. The most recent invoice from the WHO to the United States, which is one of many countries that fund the organization, was for nearly $116 million per year. The United States also voluntarily gives between approximately $100 million and $400 million more per year to the WHO for specific projects -- contributions that totaled over $400 million in 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available.\n\nThat means the United States contributed over $500 million in total to the WHO that year, which is just under one-quarter of the organization's yearly budget. The WHO's total budget for 2016 and 2017 combined was over $4 billion.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal Editorial Board also joined in the pile-on in an editorial posted Sunday evening, backing Scott's call for an investigation and warning \"foreign-policy elites\" that if they \"want to know why so many Americans mistrust international institutions, WHO is it.\"\n\nAll this comes as dissatisfaction is also building with Tedros and the WHO internationally. A Change.org petition, reported on by the Jerusalem Post, which has been translated into several different languages and cites Tedros' reluctance to question China's self-reported coronavirus numbers, among other things, has gained over 700,000 signatures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAdditionally, Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, according to Taiwanese television channel Formosa News, said that the WHO should change its name to the Chinese Health Organization over its handling of the coronavirus.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the number of coronavirus cases worldwide had surpassed 1.2 million with 69,000 deaths worldwide. In the United States, 337,000 coronavirus cases were reported and 9,600 people have died.\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams in the White House coronavirus task force briefing Sunday night said that this week will be \"the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans' lives\" -- saying it would be \"our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment.\"\n\nFox News' Dom Calicchio, Barnini Chakraborty Adam Shaw and Michael Campbell contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_olson@foxnews.com", "name": "Tyler Olson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tedros Adhanom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cover-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Bartiromo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maria Bartiromo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pompeo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pompeo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

coronavirus response", "body": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff proposes the establishment of a bipartisan commission to investigate the response to the coronavirus pandemic by the Trump administration.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris announced legislation Friday that would create a bipartisan 9/11-style commission to probe the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., formally introduced legislation in the House that would establish the bipartisan commission, while Feinstein, D-Calif., and Harris, D-Calif., said they planned to introduce companion legislation in the Senate.\n\nSCHIFF PROPOSED 9/11-STYLE COMMISSION, WITH SUBPOENA POWER, TO PROBE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nThe commission, according to the three Democrats, will \"examine U.S. government preparedness in advance of this pandemic, the Federal government's response to it, and provide recommendations to improve our ability to respond to and recover from future outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics.\" The commission will also examine state and local governments' preparedness and response.\n\nThe commission is modeled after the 9/11 Commission, which was formed in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\n\"It is clear that a comprehensive and authoritative review will be required, not as a political exercise to cast blame, but to learn from our mistakes to prevent history from tragically repeating itself,\" Schiff said in a statement Friday. \"Over the last week, I've talked with my colleagues, former commissioners, and experts, and incorporated a number of their strong recommendations into this legislation, and will continue working with other Members interested in this critical issue to come to a consensus in the coming weeks and months.\"\n\nSchiff first floated his plans to introduce a commission last month. Last week, Schiff announced that the commission would have the power to \"compel cooperation by relevant witnesses.\"\n\n\"The coronavirus showed just how unprepared and slow we were to respond to a major outbreak. And that lack of readiness endangered lives,\" Feinstein said in a statement Friday. \"We weren't able to ramp up testing, we didn't have enough safety equipment for doctors and nurses and we lacked any kind of consistent federal guidelines for states and cities. We know this won't be the last outbreak, so a 9/11 Commission-style panel is necessary to fix these mistakes going forward and apply the lessons from this pandemic to future crises.\"\n\n\"The federal government was unprepared to confront the coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis, let alone both at the same time,\" Harris said Friday. \"The commission needs to take a holistic approach to oversight, and cannot leave out an analysis of the disturbing disparity in prevention and health outcomes in the Black community.\"\n\nTRUMP REMOVES INSPECTOR GENERAL POISED TO OVERSEE CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS FUNDS\n\nThe commission, according to the Democratic lawmakers, would be composed of 10 members, with \"the same partisan balance as the 9/11 commissioners,\" and would provide \"a full accounting to the President, Congress and the American people\" related to the coronavirus outbreak, and how federal, state, local governments and the private sector responded to the crisis.\n\nThe commission would hold public hearings and events to obtain information, and, as Schiff suggested last week, would \"possess subpoena power\" to compel cooperation from federal, state and local governments.\n\nThe commission, though, is not expected to be established until February 2021 \"hopefully after the pandemic has been overcome and after the presidential election,\" they said.\n\nThe announcement comes after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week announced that she would create a separate House committee to oversee the administration's coronavirus response, chaired by Rep. James Clyburn D-S.C.\n\nPelosi said that committee is designed to address the \"here and now,\" specifically concerning the allocation of the historic amount of federal funds directed to the economic recovery, and compared it to the committee chaired by then-Sen. Harry Truman in 1941 to investigate waste, fraud and abuse in defense spending in the early days of World War II.\n\n\"With over $2 trillion in emergency relief, we need to ensure those dollars are spent carefully and effectively,\" Pelosi said of the massive stimulus bill Congress already passed to address the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBoth Pelosi and Schiff, who led Democrats' impeachment prosecution efforts, have faced GOP criticism for their plans, amid concerns they would be used to go after the Trump administration.\n\n\"His Russia collusion hoax failed, his Ukraine scam failed, and his efforts to cover up FISA abuse failed,\" Intelligence Committee Ranking Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told Fox News when Schiff first floated the commission. \"So, Schiff is launching yet another dumb stunt to justify his never-ending media relations operation.\"\n\nPresident Trump, reacting last week to Pelosi's announcement, said: \"It's witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt. ... And in the end it's people doing the witch hunt who are losing -- and they've been losing by a lot. And it's not any time for witch hunts.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump this week removed Pentagon inspector general Glenn Fine, who was tasked with monitoring the coronavirus economic relief plan. The president temporarily appointed the inspector general for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to monitor the implementation of the new law.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blasted the president for sidelining Fine from his post.\n\n\"President Trump is abusing the coronavirus pandemic to eliminate honest and independent public servants because they are willing to speak truth to power and because he is so clearly afraid of strong oversight,\" Schumer said in a statement.\n\nA Congressional Oversight Commission and other positions, though, have been established to supervise spending by the Department of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brooke_singman@foxnews.com", "name": "Brooke Singman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Permanent_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Feinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dianne Feinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "11 Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Nunes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Nunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.
