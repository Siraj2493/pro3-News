infection are similar to that of influenza (flu), which is very common in the U.S. and has already resulted in more than 8,000 U.S. deaths this flu season,\" said Schaffner. \"You can lower your risk by getting vaccinated against the flu every year, using proper hand hygiene, and avoiding people who are sick.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers tips for anyone in the

Here's what you need to know about travel insurance just in case of the unexpected.\n\nGerman native Michael Runkel has traveled to every country on Earth and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nWe discuss going to outer space, the coronavirus outbreak, what makes a good travel photo, and why long-term travel with kids doesn't suck.\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nSitting on a beautiful beach in Ko Lanta, Thailand.\n\nRELATED: THE DEMAND FOR INSTAGRAM-WORTHY PHOTOS IS HAVING A NEGATIVE EFFECT\n\nHow long did it take to visit every country?\n\nIt took 29 years. I finished in Saudi Arabia in 2018. I have been traveling for a total of 31 years, but traveling to every country was never my goal. I am not a stamps-and-stats traveler. I am more interested in having original experiences in the places I visit, but according to Nomad Mania, there are a total of 1,281 regions on the planet. I have been to 1,079 of them, and many more planned over the next 18 months. By this time next year, it's possible that I might be the most-traveled person alive.\n\nThe obvious question I'm sure you get a lot: What first inspired you to travel?\n\nI started reading Karl May when I was in primary school at the age of 9 or 10. He is mostly known for his novels about Apache Chief Winnetou and the American West, but I was really drawn to his tales of Kara Ben Nemsi and his exploits during Hajj through the Middle East. Both my parents were teachers, and we often traveled together when school was out. My grandmother spent a lot of time in Africa and Asia. I think my travel gene came from her.\n\nHow hard was it to get on that first flight and where did you go?\n\nMy first trip abroad was actually overland by bus from Germany to Syria in 1988. I was just 18. Syria at that time was fantastic. No tourists. Lots to see, lots of culture. It was a very open-minded place, and an extremely welcoming country.\n\n5 AIRLINE FEES THAT ARE WORTH PAYING (UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES)\n\nIt's been said that more people have traveled to outer space than have visited the United Nations' 193 recognized countries. (At the time of this writing, there are currently 200 verified persons that have visited every country on Earth; 500 have been to outer space). If Richard Branson called you tomorrow and said you have 15 minutes to pack your bag for a Virgin Galactic flight, what would your answer be?\n\nYes, of course! That would be a unique opportunity. I would love to see the world from outer space -- so long as he is paying.\n\nThere has been a recent spike in travelers that have been to every country, mostly Americans. There are about 10 to 20 people that pop up every year that attempt to do it. Many of them seem to me to be more inspired by a personal goal, simple attention, or just out to prove they can do it. They are not really traveling meaningfully, in my opinion.\n\nYou now travel with your entire family. Can you talk about the challenges of that? The rewards?\n\nYes. We are doing 13 months around the world, and now on our Asian leg of the trip into five countries. Last year, I had to break off from them for six weeks by myself for photo work, visiting Russia, Afghanistan and Niger. My wife is from San Diego, and they will visit her mother there toward the end of the trip while I continue on to India.\n\nTraveling with children is a challenge. We have to care for two kids. Our daughter is 4, and our son is 8 months old, but it is worth every second. We get to spend every minute with them, and we get to show them the world. We have been to some extremely remote locations together. In Vanuatu, they were the youngest white-faced children the people there had ever seen. In April, we are planning to go to the Pitcairn Islands, the remotest islands on the planet. Our tour operator tells us that they will be the youngest visitors the islands have ever had. After that, we are headed to the Amazon, then northern Vietnam.\n\nTraveling with kids is risky, but not any riskier than back home. It's important to choose the right times of the year to visit each destination. Right now we are in Thailand during the dry season. In the tropics, you have to visit at a time when there are fewer mosquitoes. Pre-plan where you want to go, get vaccinations, take bug spray and lots of hand sanitizer. When we travel, our children are very popular, and people love to touch them, which is wonderful, but it can be overwhelming. It's also just as important to not be overly cautious, or you will miss out on a lot of experiences.\n\nSchooling is an issue. Children have to go to school in Germany, it is compulsory by the age of 6. You cannot home-school them. Our oldest does not have to start primary school for two years, so we are taking this opportunity to travel with them now.\n\nIs mainland China part of your Asia itinerary? Do you have concerns about the coronavirus outbreak there?\n\nWe had an extensive trip through China planned. It was our next stop. We just learned that the government has shut down all access to the tourist sites throughout the country. Many other travelers I know have also had to cancel their visits. Right now, we are going to head back to Myanmar for an extended period. We are not sure when we might be able to plan another trip there.\n\nDo your children have dad's travel gene?\n\nI'm not sure about our littlest one yet, but I think my daughter does. She has already been to 40 countries! She definitely likes traveling. We do unusual things, and she has seen things a lot people could only dream of seeing. She is great on long flights, long bus rides. Our recent flight from L.A. to Taipei was 14 hours -- [she had] zero complaints. She loves photography, as well.\n\n8 PACKING TIPS FOR TRAVELERS LOOKING TO SAVE SPACE\n\nI have probably met more Germans on my travels than any other nationality. Is there something about the German culture that makes them want to explore the world more than others?\n\nI guess that is because we have a good social system. Most Germans have 30 days of holiday every year; we have paid parental leave for up to three years and are eligible to receive up to $2,000 per month. Our universal health care is another important factor that contributes to making extensive travel possible. In addition, Germany has a very culturally diverse population, and so your friends and neighbors are from all over the world. That provides opportunities to visit people you know in their native country. The Swedes and the Dutch also travel a lot, but just in smaller numbers.\n\nNow that you have visited every country, tell us about your thinking in choosing another destination?\n\nFor me, I would rather go to places that are interesting, especially to photograph UNESCO World Heritage Sites. I have been to 700 of them and I have 400 left to visit. I'm actually going to do a [photography] book about it later this year. These are important places. I'm curious about cultures, peoples and landscapes. By now I pretty much know the world, so I can tell you what it has to offer. I do love remote places due to fewer crowds, but it is usually the beauty of a destination that compels me to visit.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nMost harrowing travel experience?\n\nToo many to count. Crawling over unexploded ordnance in a field in Cambodia, or being stared down by an armed militia in Mogadishu immediately come to mind. But the most life-changing experience was a nighttime earthquake on Christmas Day in Bam, Iran, in 2003. I was quick to get out and saved a friend's life. The two of us managed to save another 10 people from the rubble. Everyone else on our street was killed, tens of thousands of people [in total]. The official death toll from the government was egregiously undercounted.\n\nA country that exceeded your expectations?\n\nOne for sure is Myanmar. We were just there, and my third visit. Extremely friendly people. Everyone is so nice, and it is so culturally interesting. Southern Myanmar is completely untouched by tourists. The Mergui Archipelago is a paradise and only opened to tourists four years ago.\n\nA country that didn't meet your expectations?\n\nCameroon is rough traveling -- especially in the interior -- and the police, the army, the militias, are so corrupt. A real low point. I don't plan to be back anytime soon.\n\nA country that turned your expectations on its head?\n\nHonestly, I really haven't experienced any. I usually research a country thoroughly before visiting, and so I generally know what to expect when I arrive.\n\nHow do you make a living while traveling?\n\nMainly photography. I try to take as many photos as possible. You have to be a little more prepared and sleep a little bit less. I have a secondary income teaching photography when I am home. I also sell prints on my website.\n\nYour process for documenting your travels through photography?\n\nI have a big professional database of 2.5 million photographs. I also have agents that distribute my photos worldwide, and I am represented by Robert Harding, who manages some of the world's leading travel photographers. As far as I know, I am the only dedicated travel photographer who has been to every country on Earth, so I have a unique set of photographs to offer. Much of my documentation is also client work through direct requests.\n\nWhat makes a good travel photograph and what camera do you use?\n\nThat is very subjective. Dealing with photo agents and magazines, everyone's tastes and needs are different. It's hard to say what makes a good travel photograph, but I would personally say that every good travel photograph is a good one when you like it. One thing for sure that makes an impact is great light. It's also why I like to travel in good weather. For good or bad, the travel photo market is saturated with amazing photos, making it very difficult to create photos that stand out. Today, camera technology is so much better than years ago, and people can take stunning photos with their smartphones.\n\nI have a Nikon D850, a D4 and a D800. I also take drone photos, and I use a DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone. I'm using a Mavic Mini here in Asia, due to many countries' size restrictions.\n\n'MINNIE MOUSE' FILMED BEHAVING BADLY IN LAS VEGAS\n\nWhat is one conventional myth that people who want to travel extensively need to know?\n\nIn my opinion, the world is a far better place than the media might make it seem. There are friendly people everywhere. Even in the most dangerous places, I have met wonderful and friendly people. There are bad people, too, of course, but a very small number, comparatively. The world is safe if you take precautions and use common sense everywhere you go. I was just in Afghanistan in October, and I always felt safe and never threatened.\n\nIt's not true that a problem area is representative of an entire country. Again, a good example of this is Myanmar, but it could apply almost anywhere. We have all read about the terrible violence regarding the Rohingya people. However, that is isolated in the outer northwest of the Rakhine State, and Myanmar is a big place. If you are in the central, or southern part of the country, it couldn't be safer. Focus specifically on where there are problems and simply avoid those areas.\n\nAs far as petty theft and crime, there are some areas of South and Central America to consider, mainly in the big cities and at night. Just use common sense as you would anywhere. I can't stress that enough. I have never been robbed once on my travels (knock on wood).\n\nI'm sure it's impossible to choose a favorite country, as each destination is unique. So, I'll just ask you, which country would you always return to if you had to pick?\n\nFor sure, Yemen. It is so unique. The architecture, the people, the landscapes. It's a trip back in time. In Sana'a or the mountainous region, it is like you're in the 16th Century. I absolutely love it there. Socotra Island, with its bizarre endemic plants and strange landscapes, is like the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean.\n\nWe were there right before the war began. When the conflict is over, I'll be back immediately.\n\nBack to Myanmar. After that, when my wife and kids head to San Diego, I will go on to India and Bangladesh, then up to far eastern Russia to travel the Road of Bones.\n\nVisit Michael's website, and follow him and his

"body": "President Trump delivers his third State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress, praising the economic success of his administration, highlighting efforts to reform the criminal justice system, secure the nation's borders, improve Americans' health care and fight radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nBelow are President Trump's prepared remarks for his State of the Union address on Feb. 4, 2020.\n\nMadam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow citizens:\n\nThree years ago, we launched the great American comeback. Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again! America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright.\n\nThe years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.\n\nIn just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!\n\nI am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world -- and it is not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country, and to the Members of Congress before me: The State of our Union is stronger than ever before!\n\nThe vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society -- one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success, and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise.\n\nFrom the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the United States economy -- slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed.\n\nSince my election, we have created 7 million new jobs -- 5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.\n\nIncredibly, the average unemployment rate under my Administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. If we had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witness to America's great economic success.\n\nThe unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans have reached the lowest levels in history. African-American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.\n\nAfrican-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.\n\nThe unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years -- and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.\n\nThe veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low.\n\nThe unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low.\n\nWorkers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in United States history.\n\nA record number of young Americans are now employed.\n\nUnder the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my Administration, 7 million Americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.\n\nIn 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just 3 years of my Administration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined the workforce.\n\nSince my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent -- 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast -- and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom.\n\nReal median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded!\n\nSince my election, United States stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our Nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible -- this, as other countries are not doing well. Consumer confidence has reached amazing new heights.\n\nAll of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and even 100 percent.\n\nJobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously-neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that have not seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It is all working!\n\nOpportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army Veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family -- he was homeless. But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Tony: Keep up the great work.\n\nOur roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark Criminal Justice Reform into law. Everybody said that Criminal Justice Reform could not be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done.\n\nThanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many elements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago.\n\nLikewise, we are restoring our Nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were that this could never be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my Administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built. We have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs. Companies are not leaving; they are coming back. Everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is, indeed, where the action is.\n\nOne of the single biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA's adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA -- only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law.\n\nThe USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher degree, but also to a much greater level of fairness and reciprocity. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions.\n\nI also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed that but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying: Enough. Now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is what we are doing.\n\nAs we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That is why my Administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3. Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.\n\nTo safeguard American Liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States Military. We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment -- all made in the United States of America. We are also finally getting our allies to help pay their fair share. I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled.\n\nAnd just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a new branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force.\n\nIn the gallery tonight, we have one of the Space Force's youngest potential recruits: 13-year-old Iain Lanphier, an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then, he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, \"most people look up at space, I want to look down on the world.\"\n\nSitting beside Iain tonight is his great hero. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen -- the first black fighter pilots -- and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather. After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back to a country still struggling for Civil Rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee: Our Nation salutes you.\n\nFrom the pilgrims to our Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future.\n\nMembers of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first!\n\nThe next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah's mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children.\n\nJaniyah and Stephanie are in the gallery this evening. But there is more to their story. Janiyah, I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it is going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice!\n\nNow, I call on the Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act -- because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.\n\nEvery young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the \"Be Best\" initiative -- to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation, online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children.\n\nMy Administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans.\n\nMy Budget also contains an exciting vision for our Nation's high schools. Tonight, I ask the Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America.\n\nTo expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nA good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth. Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive. I have also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions -- that is a guarantee. And we will always protect your Medicare and your Social Security.\n\nThe American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an Executive Order requiring price transparency. Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care.\n\nBut as we work to improve Americans' healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!\n\nOver 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. This is what is happening in California and other States -- their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government healthcare for illegal aliens!\n\nThis will be a tremendous boon to our already very-strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. We have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year.\n\nMy Administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down.\n\nAnd working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay.\n\nWith unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic -- drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent -- and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.\n\nProtecting Americans' health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the Coronavirus outbreak in China. My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.\n\nWe have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer's, and those struggling with mental health challenges. And because the Congress funded my request, we are pursuing new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of the decade.\n\nAlmost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, someone beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh: Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to please stand and present you with the honor. Rush, Kathryn, congratulations!\n\nAs we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke's hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was born a fighter. Through the skill of her doctors -- and the prayers of her parents -- little Ellie kept on winning the battle for life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery. Ellie and Robin: We are so glad you are here.\n\nEllie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. Thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I am asking the Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neo-natal research for America's youngest patients. That is also why I am calling upon the Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.\n\nWhether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!\n\nAs we support America's moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. Now, I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the Nation.\n\nForty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit. I have also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 States to serve more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether. And I sent the Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality childcare and urge you to act immediately.\n\nTo protect the environment, days ago, I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together Government and the private sector to plant new trees in America and around the world.\n\nWe must also rebuild America's infrastructure. I ask you to pass Senator Barrasso's highway bill -- to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels across our land.\n\nI am also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed internet, including rural America.\n\nA better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our Nation's heroic ICE officers.\n\nLast year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.\n\nTragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. In Sanctuary Cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.\n\nJust 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the Sanctuary City of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York's sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE's detainer request, his victim would be alive today.\n\nThe State of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole State to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants -- with catastrophic results.\n\nHere is just one tragic example. In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. But as required by California's Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him.\n\nDays later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims of his bloody rampage was a 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers who loved him more than anything. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody, our hearts weep for your loss -- and we will not rest until you have justice.\n\nSenator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue Sanctuary Cities and States when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly policies. I ask the Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans -- not criminal aliens!\n\nIn the last 3 years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers -- and I have signed 9 pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and around the globe.\n\nMy Administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States.\n\nBefore I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My Administration has ended Catch-and-Release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed. We entered into historic cooperation agreements with the Governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May -- dropping 8 straight months in a row. And as the wall goes up, drug seizures rise, and border crossings go down.\n\nLast year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol -- and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz: Please stand -- a grateful Nation thanks you and all the heroes of Border Patrol.\n\nTo build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.\n\nWith every action, my Administration is restoring the rule of law and re-asserting the culture of American freedom. Working with Senate Majority Leader McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new Federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nMy Administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the Constitutional right to pray in public schools. In America, we do not punish prayer. We do not tear down crosses. We do not ban symbols of faith. We do not muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith. We cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God!\n\nJust as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another Constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am President I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n\nIn reaffirming our heritage as a free Nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking the Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts -- using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.\n\nMy Administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism. Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the change to realize a better future.\n\nThree years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer Al\u2011Baghdadi -- is dead!\n\nWe are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. Kayla once wrote, \"Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love; I find God in suffering. I've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.\" In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of Al-Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, Al-Baghdadi murdered young Kayla. She was just 26 years old.\n\nOn the night that United States Special Forces Operators ended Al\u2011Baghdadi's miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team, that so perfectly carried out the operation, had given their mission a name -- \"Task Force 8-14.\" It was a reference to a special day: August 14th -- Kayla's birthday. Carl and Marsha, America's warriors never forgot Kayla -- and neither will we.\n\nEvery day, America's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depths of love that dwells in the human heart.\n\nOne of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his 1-year-old son, Gage: \"I will be with you again,\" he wrote to Gage. \"I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. I love you son, take care of your mother. I am always with you. Dad.\" On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now 13 years old. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever.\n\nThe terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life. Soleimani was the Iranian Regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault on United States Forces in Iraq, and was actively planning new attacks. That is why, last month, at my direction, the United States Military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.\n\nOur message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life!\n\nIn recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very poorly. We can help them make it very good in a short period of time, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let's see which road they choose. It is totally up to them.\n\nAs we defend American lives, we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency. These are warfighters, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home!\n\nWar places a heavy burden on our Nation's extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her 2 children -- 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan. Amy works full time, and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the Middle East. Amy's kids have not seen their father's face in many months. Amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and peace -- we thank you.\n\nAs the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is the place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great Generals, including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo.\n\nThe American Nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out canals, raised up the skyscrapers -- and, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional Republic ever to exist in all of human history. And we are making it greater than ever before!\n\nThis is our glorious and magnificent inheritance.\n\nWe are Americans. We are the pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the new world, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God.\n\nAmerica is the place where anything can happen! America is the place where anyone can rise. And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true!\n\nThis Nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American Age, the American Epic, the American Adventure, has only just begun!\n\nOur spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!\n\nThank you. God Bless You.

In respiratory illnesses, people with the most symptoms are the most contagious, the agency said. Children and those over 65 are the most likely to get sick from the flu, the CDC added.\n\nHOW IS CORONAVIRUS TRANSMITTED?\n\nUnlike the coronavirus, there's a seasonal vaccine for the flu. People over six months out are advised by the agency to get it during annual vaccination, with certain rare exceptions, such as severe allergies to the shot.\n\nNo vaccine has been developed for coronavirus as of yet, which makes it dangerous in that respect.\n\nHow did it start?\n\nIt's not entirely clear how it started, but Chinese scientists believe the virus may have originated in bats. A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that genome sequences from seven patients tested were identical to the bat coronavirus.\n\nHow does it transmit?\n\nIt's believed the normal coronavirus can be transmitted most commonly through respiratory droplets in the air, as well as close contact with an infected person or touching areas contaminated with the virus before washing. The digestive tract may also transmit the disease, according to scientists from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinses Academy of Science.\n\nHOW IS CORONAVIRUS TRANSMITTED?\n\nThey recently discovered \"virus genetic material\" in feces samples and rectal swabs from some patients, Chinese state media reported.\n\nWhat are the current travel restrictions?\n\nThe U.S. declared the coronavirus a public health emergency last Friday with Trump signing an order barring entry to foreign nationals who recently were in China, other than the immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.\n\nCHINA SLAMS TRUMP'S CORONAVIRUS TRAVEL LIMITS: 'NOT A GESTURE OF GOODWILL'\n\nOfficials at the CDC have advised travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country. The U.S. State Department raised its China travel advisory to \"Level 4: Do Not Travel.\" The U.S. expanded the screening of travelers arriving from Wuhan from five to 20 airports.\n\n\"Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus,\" The advisory said.\n\nVietnam stopped all flights to and from China.\n\nJapan, Singapore, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia all have similar policies to the U.S. on restricting non-citizens.\n\nMongolia and Singapore have shut their borders.\n\nSingapore said it would ban travelers from China's Hubei province.\n\nAIRLINE PASSENGER ARRESTED OVER FALSE CORONAVIRUS CLAIM SAYS HE DID IT FOR 'PUBLICITY'\n\nPakistan says they're halting all flights to and from China until Feb. 2.\n\nThe United Kingdom and New Zealand advised their people against nonessential travel to China.\n\nRussia has signed an order to close the border between them and China. They also blocked tour groups from China.\n\nChina has cut off access to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, trapping more than 50 million people\n\nHong Kong quarantining visitors from mainland China\n\nMORE AMERICANS TO BE EVACUATED FROM CHINA AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: OFFICIALS\n\nJapan bars foreign nationals who had been to Hubei province.\n\nCarnival and Royal Carribean denying boarding of people who travel to China within 14 days.\n\nItaly suspended all flights to China.\n\nUNITED AIRLINES SUSPENDS ALL FLIGHTS TO HONG KONG AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\nSouth Korea urged an increase in its level of caution to \"restraint\" when traveling to China.\n\nHong Kong reduced half its flights and shut down rail service to mainland China.\n\nCathay Pacific Airways asks 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave.\n\nDelta suspended all service to China\n\nUnited Airlines suspends all flights between China and the U.S.\n\nUnited's pilots, concerned for their safety, were able to drop trips to China without pay, a union memo said, according to Reuters.\n\nAmerican Airlines suspends all flights to China.\n\nThe Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents 15,000 pilots for American Airlines filed a lawsuit to halt service with the airline, citing \"serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus.\"\n\n\"I am directing all APA pilots to cease flight operations between the United States and China,\" said APA president Eric Ferguson. \"Until further notice, if you are scheduled, assigned, or reassigned a pairing into China, decline the assignment by calling your Chief Pilot or IOC Duty Pilot. Inform them you are declining in accordance with the CDC and WHO declarations.\"\n\nAMERICAN AIRLINES SUED OVER CORONAVIRUS BY PLOT SEEKING TO CANCEL US-CHINA FLIGHTS\n\nBritish Airways suspended all flights to and from mainland China.\n\nVirgin Atlantic suspending operations to Shanghai for two weeks.\n\nLufthansa suspending flights to and from China\n\nAir India and Seoul Air halting all flights to the country.\n\nFinnair, Cathay Pacific, and Jetstar also stopping service.\n\nLion Air canceled 50 flights to China into February.\n\nAir Canada suspending all direct flights to Beijing and

Here's what you need to know as you start your Wednesday ...\n\nTrump takes on 'radical left' in defiant State of the Union address; Pelosi rips up speech\n\nPresident Trump went on the offensive against socialism and left-wing policies during a defiant third State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday night -- drawing groans from Democrats in attendance and prompting a furious House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to rip up her copy of Trump's speech as soon as it concluded in a stunning scene.\n\nAsked about the moment by Fox News afterward, Pelosi said she had destroyed the speech \"because it was the courteous thing to do considering the alternatives.\" She also said she was \"trying to find one page with truth on it\" but \"couldn't.\"\n\nThe White House responded almost immediately by referencing several of the guests of honor whom Trump had introduced during the State of the Union address.\n\n\"Speaker Pelosi just ripped up: One of our last surviving Tuskegee Airmen. The survival of a child born at 21 weeks. The mourning families of Rocky Jones and Kayla Mueller. A service member's reunion with his family,\" the White House said in a tweet. \"That's her legacy.\"\n\nThe flareup was a harsh reminder of the partisan discord pervading the halls of Congress, even as Trump in his speech all but ignored the historic impeachment drama that flanked this year's address -- a fight virtually certain to end with Trump's acquittal at his Senate impeachment trial on Wednesday. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a key swing vote in Trump's impeachment trial, announced Tuesday she would vote to acquit on both articles of impeachment.

Bernie Sanders is close behind the former South Bend, Ind., mayor, with 71 percent of precincts reporting in the first batches released by the embattled state party. Sanders is also ahead in the popular vote, with 24 percent to Buttigieg's 21 percent, Elizabeth Warren's 19 percent and Joe Biden's 15 percent.

The news comes as infections outside of China continue to increase.\n\nAll 2,666 guests and 1,045 crewmembers aboard the Diamond Princess have been quarantined for over a day and are likely to remain for \"at least 14 days as required by the Ministry of Health,\" according to the cruise line.\n\nThe infected passengers include one from the U.S., two from Australia, three from Japan, three from Hong Kong and one crew member from the Philippines.

ugly", "body": "The CDC has confirmed the 7th case of the disease in the US, insight from Dr. Marc Siegel.\n\nMost of us feel at least a bit of anxiety over the latest 'flu' challenge - novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This stems primarily from the fact that we have a sense of helplessness about protecting ourselves and loved ones from this unknown. With the loss of trust in so many institutions, we're also not certain that those charged with keeping us safe are actually doing what needs to be done.\n\nSo far there have been only eight cases of infection in the U.S. by this new bug It appears that all but one of those have occurred in people who had traveled to Wuhan, China before coming to the states and therefore contracted their illness outside of our borders. The spouse of one of these patients - who had not traveled to China - contracted the disease, which is evidence for the human to human transmission. This raises the greatest concern of all. However, it appears that close contact with an infected person is needed in order to become infected yourself.\n\nCORONAVIRUS EVACUEES TO BE HOUSED AT CALIFORNIA, TEXAS AND COLORADO MILITARY BASES\n\nIt also appears that the mortality rate of this new infection is significantly less than other coronavirus epidemics (SARS and MERS) within the past 20 years. Around 10 percent of those contracting SARS died and 34 percent of those with MERS didn't survive. Though it's early with the Wuhan virus, it appears that the mortality rate is 2-3%. Should this hold, understanding that any virus can mutate at any time to become more virulent, it will be a blessing that we don't see a higher death rate.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nWhen a new coronavirus presents itself, it usually can be rapidly contained because its transmission most often is from animal to human. This allows for much easier isolation of people from the source of infection along with work to decrease the number of vector agents. This 2019-nCoV has demonstrated extremely rapid spread which made it apparent early on that human to human transmission was likely, if not proven quickly. As of this writing, there have been over 14,000 documented cases with the spread of infection including persons who had not traveled to or from China. This makes it much more difficult to isolate, predict and control.\n\nIn addition, because viruses are not able to be treated with antibiotics, the care available for those infected is primarily supportive. Treatment consists of mitigating the symptoms with fluids, anti-viral agents and medications for fever and aches. A vaccine is the best form of care to stop the spread and prevent greater numbers of infections from occurring or spreading. With a new virus, however, developing a vaccine that is safe and effective takes some time. The gene sequence of 2019-nCoV was determined very quickly and the CDC has made that information available to all so that manufacturers can work as rapidly as possible to develop that new vaccine. It is likely that we'll not have this protection available until late summer or early fall at the very earliest.\n\nTHE UGLY\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has appropriately declared that this epidemic is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Dr. Tedros, the WHO Director-General, and his team are working overtime to try to contain this current challenge. This requires that all parties in the world share information and cooperate in order to solve this quickly.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nChina, however, is China. If the past is prologue, there is little confidence that China is sharing all the needed information, especially the number of cases and deaths. There are anecdotal reports that there are thousands of deaths in China that have yet to be reported to the international health community. Bugs are smart and have no respect for international or geographical boundaries. This is precisely why complete candor and sharing of information is vital to an appropriate response and conclusion of this epidemic.\n\nOne would think that the WHO would have the benefit of the world's greatest knowledge and complete participation, especially at emergent times such as this. Sadly, due to politics, that is not the case. Taiwan has shown itself to be extremely responsible and transparent in its actions, especially in the area of medicine and science. Having had the privilege of visiting recently, the capacity of Taiwan to help formulate a vaccine or assist in other ways to help save lives and advance human engagement and intelligence at this time is remarkable.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, China and other nations refuse to allow the full and equitable participation of Taiwan in the WHO. This increases the danger for all of us and makes global health security in times of crisis that much more difficult. The U.S. has appropriately and rightly supported Taiwan in its stated goal to participate in all international organizations. Ending Chinese political opposition to this is an important step in making the world safer.\n\nFinally, and to put this in context, the average number of deaths from the annual flu in the U.S. is 12,000 - 60,000. This year's estimates are that it will kill 35,000. So, the best thing you and your family can do is to get a flu shot every year. That will be the most helpful for all.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_price@foxnews.com", "name": "Tom Price", "type": "author",

"Experts worry about pandemic as coronavirus numbers increase: report", "body": "The CDC has confirmed the 7th case of the disease in the US, insight from Dr. Marc Siegel.\n\nExperts believe the highly transmissible coronavirus will become a pandemic as infected numbers continue to increase in China and countries around the world, according to a startling report.\n\nA pandemic is described as a disease that spreads across a large region, across continents and even the entire globe. The coronavirus is reportedly spreading at a similar pace to influenza compared to the slow-moving SARS and MERS, according to the New York Times.\n\n\"It's very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,\" Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, told the paper.\n\nCHINA SAYS US HASN'T GIVEN ANY SIGNIFICANT HELP IN CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, CREATED PANIC: REPORT\n\nThere are now 11 confirmed cases in the U.S.\n\nAs of Monday morning, there are six in California, one in Arizona, one in Washington state, one in Massachusetts and two in Illinois. No deaths have been reported in the U.S. and 99 percent of cases still remain in China.\n\nThree more people were announced to have been infected in California on Sunday.\n\n\"I understand that people are concerned, but based on what we know today, the risk to [the] general public remains low,\" said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County's health officer. \"A second case is not unexpected. With our large population and the amount of travel to China for both personal and business reasons, we will likely see more cases.\"\n\nThe U.S. announced Sunday that Americans who traveled to China within the last 14 days would be sent to designated airports for enhanced screenings. Foreign nationals who recently went to China would be denied entry, other than the immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.\n\nFORMER HHS SECRETARY TOM PRICE, M.D.: CORONAVIRUS - THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry said on Monday that the U.S. hasn't given the country any substantive help in its fight against the coronavirus outbreak. They added the U.S. was contributing to the international panic surrounding the illness, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nThree people in New York City are also being tested for the coronavirus after they made recent trips to mainland China, according to the state's department of public health.\n\n\"We are continuing to work closely with our partners at the CDC, State, and federal government as the coronavirus situation evolves,\" said Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot. \"If you have traveled to the area affected by the outbreak in the last 14 days and feel unwell, call your doctor or visit a clinic, and you will be cared for.\"\n\n2ND CASE OF CORONAVIRUS CONFIRMED IN BAY AREA, MARKING 9TH CASE IN US\n\nTest results conducted by the CDC will take roughly 36-48 hours to determine if the three people in New York City were infected with the virus.\n\nWeeks after China announced the outbreak of the coronavirus, the international community has increased measures to prevent a widespread epidemic.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global emergency as it spreads to countries outside of China and the number of infected patients continues to grow.\n\nCountries around the globe have increased travel restrictions to the infected mainland China and Hubei province -- with the U.S. State Department increasing its advisory to level 4: \"Do Not Travel.\"\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT, CITING CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, RAISES CHINA TRAVEL ADVISORY: 'DO NOT TRAVEL'\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have advised travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country.\n\nCoronavirus has now infected more people in China than were sickened during the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s.\n\nThe death toll from the virus has increased to 361 on Monday, with a total of 17,205 infected -- an increase of nearly 20 percent in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe first death outside of China was recorded in the Philippines on Sunday. The 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan was hospitalized last week with a fever, cough and sore throat, and died after developing severe pneumonia, according to the Philippines health department.\n\nThe WHO said the number of cases will keep growing as tests are pending on thousands of suspected cases.\n\nWhere is the virus?\n\nRoughly 99 percent of new cases have appeared in China with the vast majority of the cases in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan -- the epicenter of the virus.\n\nAbout 150 cases have been reported in at least 25 countries globally.\n\nThe United Kingdom announced on Friday it has two cases of the virus, who are reportedly members of the same family.\n\nCORONAVIRUS MAY HAVE SPRUNG FROM 'PERFECT MIXING POT,' INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR SAYS\n\n\"The patients are receiving specialist NHS [National Health Service] care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus,\" said Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer.\n\nThe flu has estimated to have killed roughly 10,000 to 25,000 people with nearly 19 to 26 million infected in the U.S. between October 1, 2019, and January 25, 2020, according to the CDC. Coronavirus has impacted a far lesser number, although it's not yet clear how many have been infected or how widespread it is.\n\nThere have also been reports it can be spread without symptoms showing up. In respiratory illnesses, people with the most symptoms are the most contagious, the agency said. Children and those over 65 are the most likely to get sick from the flu, the CDC added.\n\nHOW IS CORONAVIRUS TRANSMITTED?\n\nUnlike the coronavirus, there's a seasonal vaccine for the flu. People over six months out are advised by the agency to get it during annual vaccination, with certain rare exceptions, such as severe allergies to the shot.\n\nNo vaccine has been developed for coronavirus as of yet, which makes it dangerous in that respect.\n\nWhat are the current travel restrictions?\n\nThe U.S. declared the coronavirus a public health emergency on Friday with Trump signing an order barring entry to foreign nationals who recently were in China, other than the immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.\n\nCHINA SLAMS TRUMP'S CORONAVIRUS TRAVEL LIMITS: 'NOT A GESTURE OF GOODWILL'\n\nOfficials at the CDC have advised travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country. The U.S. State Department raised its China travel advisory to \"Level 4: Do Not Travel.\" The U.S. expanded the screening of travelers arriving from Wuhan from five to 20 airports.\n\n\"Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus,\" The advisory said.\n\nVietnam stopped all flights to and from China.\n\nJapan, Singapore, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia all have similar policies to the U.S. on restricting non-citizens.\n\nMongolia and Singapore have shut their borders.\n\nSingapore said it would ban travelers from China's Hubei province.\n\nPakistan says they're halting all flights to and from China until Feb. 2.\n\nCORONAVIRUS DEATH IN PHILIPPINES SADI TO BE FIRST OUTSIDE CHINA\n\nThe United Kingdom and New Zealand advised their people against nonessential travel to China.\n\nRussia has signed an order to close the border between them and China. They also blocked tour groups from China.\n\nChina has cut off access to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, trapping more than 50 million people.\n\nJapan bars foreign nationals who had been to Hubei province.\n\nCarnival and Royal Carribean denying boarding of people who travel to China within 14 days.\n\nItaly suspended all flights to China.\n\nCHINA DEPLOYS 1,400 MILITARY DOCTORS, NURSES TO STAFF MAKESHIFT HOSPITALS IN WUHAN\n\nSouth Korea urged an increase in its level of caution to \"restraint\" when traveling to China.\n\nHong Kong reduced half its flights and shut down rail service to mainland China.\n\nDelta suspended service to China on Feb. 6.\n\nUnited's pilots, concerned for their safety, were able to drop trips to China without pay, a union memo said, according to Reuters.\n\nAmerican Airlines suspended L.A. flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing.\n\nThe Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents 15,000 pilots for American Airlines filed a lawsuit to halt service with the airline, citing \"serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus.\"\n\n\"I am directing all APA pilots to cease flight operations between the United States and China,\" said APA president Eric Ferguson. \"Until further notice, if you are scheduled, assigned, or reassigned a pairing into China, decline the assignment by calling your Chief Pilot or IOC Duty Pilot. Inform them you are declining in accordance with the CDC and WHO declarations.\"\n\nAMERICAN AIRLINES SUED OVER CORONAVIRUS BY PLOT SEEKING TO CANCEL US-CHINA FLIGHTS\n\nDelta suspending service on Feb 6. -- last flight on Monday.\n\nBritish Airways suspended all flights to and from mainland China.\n\nVirgin Atlantic suspending operations to Shanghai for two weeks.\n\nLufthansa suspending flights to and from China until Feb. 9.\n\nAir India and Seoul Air halting all flights to the country.\n\nFinnair, Cathay Pacific, and Jetstar also stopping service.\n\nLion Air canceled 50 flights to China into February.\n\nAir Canada suspending all direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":
