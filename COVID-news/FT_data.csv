Ministers had high hopes that the arrival of the tests would give a much clearer picture about how many people had been infected by Covid-19, paving the way for an eventual easing of lockdown restrictions.

The failure of the tests is a significant setback and suggests Britain may be further away from being able to launch an effective programme of mass testing.

The government is working with nine companies that have developed coronavirus antibody tests, which screen for whether someone has recovered from the disease and is likely to be immune. The tests are being assessed by researchers at Oxford university -- but each one has so far proven unreliable.

""Sadly, the tests we have looked at to date have not performed well,"" wrote Professor John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford university on Monday.

""We see many false negatives (tests where no antibody is detected despite the fact we know it is there) and we also see false positives. None of the tests we have validated would meet the criteria for a good test as agreed with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. This is not a good result for test suppliers or for us,"" he said.

Last week Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said the government had placed a provisional order for 17.5m antibody tests. ""We will only use them if they work,"" he said.

Downing Street confirmed on Monday that ""no test so far has been proved to be good enough to be used"" and said it was working with the companies to improve their quality.

""No government in the world has rolled out a full antibody testing programme,"" a spokesperson for the prime minister added.

The government issued guidance about its testing plans at the weekend, saying that if the antibody tests ""do not work, no further tests will be purchased and, where possible, orders will be cancelled"".

Ministers had hoped to send out at-home antibody testing kits, though the medical community had said this would not be appropriate.

Many of the Covid-19 antibody tests on the market claim high accuracy rates. However, since they were developed in a matter of only months, the claims for many are based on only a few hundred samples.

To be considered accurate, devices must be able to distinguish the presence in someone's blood of antibodies specific to this coronavirus, and also be able to identify antibodies in people who have had relatively mild strains of the disease.

""One of the problems in this sort of work is that you can jump too quickly. When you don't have enough samples you can be misled: 100 tests might look good, but after 20,000 they might not,"" said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.

Prof Bell said the Oxford researchers would continue to look for a test that works. ""The government will be working with suppliers both new and old to try and deliver this result so we can scale up antibody testing for the British public. This will take at least a month,"" he said.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Antibody'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'False positives and false negatives'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pandemic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Government of the United Kingdom'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicines_and_Healthcare_products_Regulatory_Agency', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regius_Professor_of_Medicine_(Oxford)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Regius Professor of Medicine (Oxford)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health_and_Social_Care', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Secretary of State for Health and Social Care'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Hancock', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Matt Hancock'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'University of Oxford'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'University'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Prime Minister of the United Kingdom'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Downing Street'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'University of East Anglia'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Medicine'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Oxford'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Oxford'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing', 'label': 'dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing', 'wgt': 48}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Test_and_Measurement', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Test and Measurement', 'wgt': 37}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing', 'wgt': 40}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities', 'wgt': 39}, {'uri': 'news/Health', 'label': 'news/Health', 'wgt': 57}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fc9e54188-7e5a-42ce-84a4-c98eec6b989b.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,eng-5663672,,{'facebook': 3896},0.1215686274509804,3896,101

Professor Mauro Ferrari, who started a four-year term as leader of Europe's flagship scientific institution on January 1, submitted his resignation to EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday afternoon.

""I have been extremely disappointed by the European response to Covid-19,"" he said in a statement to the Financial Times. ""I arrived at the ERC a fervent supporter of the EU [but] the Covid-19 crisis completely changed my views, though the ideals of international collaboration I continue to support with enthusiasm.""

The ERC, set up in 2007 to fund Europe's best scientists, has become one of the world's most prestigious funding agencies with a budget of around â‚¬2bn a year.

Prof Ferrari, an Italian-American pioneer of nanomedicine, said his rift with the European Commission started in early March ""as it became evident that the pandemic would be a tragedy of possibly unprecedented proportions"".

He said he proposed then to set up a special ERC programme to combat Covid-19. ""I thought that at a time like this, the very best scientists in the world should be provided with resources and opportunities to fight the pandemic, with new drugs, new vaccines, new diagnostic tools, new behavioural dynamic approaches based on science, to replace the oft-improvised intuitions of political leaders,"" he said.

But the ERC Scientific Council, its governing body, unanimously rejected the idea, he said, on the grounds that its remit allows it only to fund ""bottom-up"" research proposed by scientists, rather than larger ""top-down"" programmes with objectives set by EU leaders.

""I argued that this was not the time for scientific governance to worry excessively about the subtleties of the distinctions between bottom-up versus top-down research,"" said Prof Ferrari, who spent much of his career as a prominent cancer researcher in the US.

He said he got a second chance when Ms von der Leyen asked him for his views on addressing the pandemic. He then developed a plan ""to which she contributed substantial directives"".

""The very fact that I worked directly with her created an internal political thunderstorm,"" he said. ""The proposal was passed on to different layers of European Commission administration, where I believe it disintegrated upon impact.""

The commission confirmed that Prof Ferrari had stepped down but did not respond to a request for further comment.

Prof Ferrari lamented ""the complete absence of co-ordination of healthcare policies among member states, the recurrent opposition to cohesive financial support initiatives, the pervasive one-sided border closures"" in the EU.

The pandemic has stoked tensions within the bloc and led to criticism that some EU countries have failed to co-operate or show solidarity with those hit hardest by coronavirus.

Janez Lenarcic, the EU's crisis management commissioner, said on Tuesday that member states had initially not offered the help needed by Italy as the death toll there soared.

""There was an inadequate response to the Italian request for assistance from other EU member states,"" he told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday, as he unveiled a plan to dispatch doctors and nurses from Romania and Norway to Italy. ""But things have changed now.""

With the commission's agreement, Prof Ferrari remained a part-time affiliate professor at the University of Washington School of Pharmacy in Seattle after he became ERC president. He plans now to set up an international research initiative to fight Covid-19 from the US.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Research_Council', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'European Research Council'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ferrari'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'European Commission'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Europe'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Ursula von der Leyen'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pandemic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'European Union'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Americans', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Italian Americans'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Nanomedicine'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Financial Times'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Vaccine'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Democracy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Euro'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Brussels'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Brussels'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Belgium'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Member state of the European Union'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Oncology'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Health care'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Italy'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Italy'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Nursing'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Seattle'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Seattle'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Romania'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Romania'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Norway'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Norway'}}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Government', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Government', 'wgt': 17}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral', 'wgt': 19}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Science/Organizations', 'label': 'dmoz/Science/Organizations', 'wgt': 18}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Science/Organizations/Research_Funding', 'label': 'dmoz/Science/Organizations/Research Funding', 'wgt': 16}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F8c01be27-b6ae-4e67-9c77-2a886d33826a.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,eng-5669244,,{'facebook': 3314},-0.01960784313725494,3314,101

Now even Mr Calenda, a 46-year-old former minister and Italian permanent representative to the EU, is experiencing a crisis of faith in an idea he has spent a lifetime fighting for.

""This is an existential threat, I am not sure if we are going to make it,"" he says. ""You have to consider my party is one of the most pro-European parties in Italy and I now have members writing to me saying: 'Why do we want to stay in the EU? It is useless.'""

As Italy faces its most severe crisis since the second world war, with more than 15,000 deaths from coronavirus and its economy on course to suffer the deepest recession in its modern history, there is a rising feeling among even its pro-European elite that the country is being abandoned by its neighbours.

""A massive, massive shift is happening in Italy. You have thousands of pro-Europeans moving to this position,"" says Mr Calenda, who leads the recently formed liberal Action party.

Last month Sergio Mattarella, Italy's softly-spoken 78-year-old president, and the man its establishment has relied on to safeguard its constitution and international alliances, warned the future of Europe was at stake if its institutions did not show solidarity with their country.

""I hope that everyone fully understands, before it is too late, the seriousness of the threat to Europe,"" he said in an evening television address beamed into the homes of millions of Italians.

Many in Rome now feel that unless bold action is taken by northern European countries, they risk Italy turning its back on the European project forever.

There are already signs that Italian faith in the EU has been damaged. In a survey conducted last month by TecnÃ¨, 67 per cent of respondents said they believed being part of the union was a disadvantage for their country, up from 47 per cent in November 2018.

Donald Tusk, the former European Council president, told the FT the situation today was much more worrying than during the euro crisis -- both politically and economically.

Southern European expectations of a rapid demonstration of solidarity from the rest of the EU early in the pandemic were not met, even if the bloc has subsequently ramped up its assistance including financial aid and equipment.

""I hope everything can be fixed, but the loss of reputation is huge,"" says Mr Tusk, who is now president of the European People's party, the centre-right political alliance. ""We must save Italy, Spain and the whole of Europe and not be afraid of extraordinary measures. This is a state of emergency.""

Mr Tusk says the EU's assistance for Italy and other hard-hit countries is vastly more substantial than that from China and Russia, but he warns that ""in politics perception can be more important than fact"".

In 2018 Italy became the first founding member to elect a government hostile to the EU, with Matteo Salvini, the anti-immigration League leader and then deputy prime minister of the coalition government, raging against ""the Brussels bunker"".

The following year that government fell, and Mr Salvini was banished to opposition, giving pro-Europeans hope that the nationalist threat had faded. But many believe bitterness felt from events over the past month could permanently alter the country's politics in Mr Salvini's favour.

""There was a feeling before that the political system had marginalised the anti-EU forces,"" says Lorenzo Pregliasco, a pollster at YouTrend. ""Now if pro-European party activists and politicians are no longer so sure how they feel, imagine what the voters think.""

At the core of the argument is a bitter divide over the extent to which euro area countries should be pursuing a far more unified economic response to the crisis. Finance ministers will meet on Tuesday to attempt to agree a package of measures aimed at marshalling greater Europe-wide fiscal firepower.

Italy is among the member states that are pushing for the euro area to be far more ambitious by collectively selling bonds to help fund the massive economic rebuilding efforts that lie ahead.

The discussions mark just the latest iteration of a longstanding dispute over collective fiscal action that economists call debt mutualisation -- and which many see as the biggest missing element of the single currency.

The EU does have a rescue fund called the European Stability Mechanism which countries can use. But despite assurances to the contrary from the ESM's managing director, Klaus Regling, many Italians still fear lending from the institution would come with tough conditions attached and would stigmatise the country. It would feel to many that their country was being punished for a disaster that was outside of its control.

Roberto Gualtieri, Italy's finance minister, has said that Italian gross domestic product is likely to fall by 6 per cent this year. Other economists believe this may be a conservative estimate. With the country entering the crisis with a debt-to-GDP ratio already at 136 per cent, there is a real threat that Italy's debt reaches a level that brings into question its sustainability.

In March, with the virus already ripping through southern Europe, nine euro members led by France, Italy and Spain signed a joint letter pushing for so-called coronabonds -- jointly issued debt backed by all euro countries including deep-pocketed Germany -- to help pay for the recovery effort.

The depth of divisions over the topic was exposed at a tough EU leaders' video conference call in late March in which the Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte and his allies pushed hard for the door to be opened to coronabonds.

Mr Conte said the euro area's bailout instruments had been developed for the last crisis and were ill-suited to the current symmetric shock hitting the entire continent. ""What will we tell our citizens if Europe does not prove capable of a united, strong and cohesive reaction in the face of a symmetrical, unpredictable shock of this historical magnitude?"" he asked.

Leaders eventually struck a compromise and issued a statement using vague language that effectively kicked deliberations in to Tuesday's eurogroup meeting of finance ministers.

But the truce did not last long. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president and a former German defence minister, appeared to use dismissive language in an interview, describing coronabonds as a slogan and appearing to express sympathy with Germany's concerns about the idea.

The language provoked immediate rebukes from Mr Conte and Mr Gualtieri, forcing the commission to issue a late-night statement that vowed to leave open all options that are compatible with the EU treaty.

Ms Von der Leyen's shifting positions reflected in part sharp divisions among her commissioners as well as the EU as a whole over the idea of coronabonds.

While the discussion over which financial instruments can be used to help Italy is technical, the tone of the debate has become emotionally charged in both southern Europe and in the north, where the Netherlands has sided with Germany in opposing coronabonds.

Mr Calenda last week took out a full-page advert in the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, signed by himself and a number of leftwing mayors and governors from the regions worst-hit by the outbreak.

In it they attacked the Dutch position as ""an example of a lack of ethics and solidarity"", called the country a tax haven and compared German reluctance to support joint European debt with the partial cancellation of Nazi war debts by European countries including Italy after the second world war.

""Germany could never have paid it,"" the letter said. ""Your place is with the Europe of institutions, of values of freedom and solidarity. Not following small national egoisms.""

""They shouldn't be using such emotional arguments,"" says Eckhardt Rehberg, a German MP in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union. ""Every country should ask itself whether it bears some responsibility for the situation it is in. Look at Italy's health system. You cannot blame all your difficulties on Europe and Germany. As a German politician, I find that unfair.""

The current German-Italian tensions are part of a much longer dispute, stretching back to the eurozone sovereign debt crisis of 2010-12.

Even back then, many in southern Europe saw eurobonds as a potential solution. But Ms Merkel was always opposed, saying in 2012 that there would be no such instruments ""as long as I live"". For the chancellor and her CDU party, the EU treaties were sacrosanct: and they expressly forbade the mutualisation of debt. The rule was clear: states cannot finance each other.

Yet in the eurozone more broadly, her reputation suffered. Southerners increasingly saw her as Europe's great disciplinarian. Posters appeared in Greece showing her with a Hitler moustache. She was depicted as a witch, a dominatrix or a wicked stepmother, and accused of trying to subjugate the whole continent.

In Italy the hostility to her was fanned by the media empire of then prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Records of bugged phone calls emerged in which he referred to the chancellor in extremely disparaging terms. In August 2012 the newspaper Il Giornale, owned by Mr Berlusconi's brother, had a front-page picture of Ms Merkel raising her hand in a vaguely fascist salute, accompanied by an article claiming Italy was ""no longer in Europe, it is in the Fourth Reich"".

The crisis has emboldened politicians on Italy's right who sense the mood in the country is shifting against Brussels, as well as becoming more anti-German.

""The EU has gone from doing absolutely nothing to some trying to profit from the difficulties we are facing,"" says Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy, which has made significant gains in opinion polls to become the second most popular rightwing party after Mr Salvini's League.

""There are people who are trying to use the virus to speculate. There is a game to weaken Italy and buy its strategic assets,"" she told the FT. ""While we are counting our dead, they are counting the risk of losing interest on their bonds.""

Claudio Borghi, a League MP who has led a ferocious campaign against Italy accepting money from the ESM -- arguing it would be tantamount to a surrender of sovereignty -- this week posted an Italian Fascist era poster with a smiling German soldier extending his hand. The text reads ""Germany is truly your friend"". Mr Borghi wrote: ""Time goes on, but the tactics are always the same.""

Franziska Brantner, a German Green MP, says the Italians she has spoken to see themselves as ""a laboratory for corona"", adding: ""[They feel] Germany is just watching them and trying to learn from their experience. There is real bitterness among my pro-European friends in Italy. They're saying what have we done to the Germans to make them treat us like this?""

Italy's pro-Europeans are hoping that the mounting shock from the Covid-19 crisis will jolt recalcitrant northern European countries into making a large enough gesture of solidarity to repair the damage that has been done.

In recent days opponents of collective fiscal action have been on the defensive as the sheer scale of the economic slump has become clearer. In the Netherlands, the government of prime minister Mark Rutte last Wednesday proposed a solidarity fund worth â‚¬20bn, with cash transfers set to go straight to the coffers of Rome and Madrid to fund emergency medical spending.

His finance minister Wopke Hoekstra had been criticised in the south after he called on Brussels to investigate why some economies did not have fiscal buffers to see them through a crisis. Portugal's prime minister AntÃ³nio Costa called the remarks ""repulsive"".

Mr Rutte's proposal would only fill a small part of the gap given the vertiginous public finance challenges facing Italy and Spain, but the very fact that a country that has traditionally been a vociferous opponent of any fiscal transfers between euro area members should make such a suggestion is indicative of the changing public mood.

Bruno Le Maire, France's finance minister, on Thursday laid out plans for an ""exceptional and temporary"" joint fund that would help countries kick-start their recoveries. This would issue bonds with the joint guarantee of all EU member states and be operated by the European Commission.

""Solidarity means to be able to pull together our resources to cope with the aftermath of the crisis,"" he said. ""Let's avoid any ideological debates on eurobonds or coronabonds. There is one single political question: shall we stand together or not?""

For Mr Tusk there is now little time left for the EU's richest nations to come forward with bold and positive initiatives and avoid instilling any sense of humiliation in countries that needed help. ""People are suffering now -- it is not a political game,"" he says. ""People have to feel that we are a real community and a real family in such a time.""","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri':

The Food Foundation, a research organisation, said on Saturday that 6 per cent of surveyed adults, the equivalent of 3m people, told them that a lack of food had forced someone in their household to go without eating during the past three weeks.

In the survey of 4,343 adults, which was carried out by polling organisation YouGov on behalf of the Food Foundation, 16 per cent of respondents, the equivalent of a total of 8.1m people, said they had faced food insecurity of some kind as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The sharp rise in food poverty is being driven by self-isolation and a lack of money as an unprecedented economic shutdown leaves millions of workers newly unemployed, furloughed or dependent on government support.

""There is a food poverty problem that has not been dealt with, and we're seeing the results of that now,"" said Anna Taylor, executive director of the Food Foundation. ""On top of that, we have new problems around isolation and shortages -- people are telling us they simply can't get out to get the food they need.""

According to the survey, 3 per cent of respondents, the equivalent of 1.5m people, had gone a whole day without eating since the lockdown came into effect.

Among those who said they were facing food insecurity, 50 per cent said they were struggling because of pandemic-related shortages and 25 per because they could not leave their homes to shop.

Some 21 per cent were hungry because they simply did not have enough money. More than 2 per cent of respondents, the equivalent of 1m people, said they had lost all their income since the lockdown had begun.

The Food Foundation and other charities have called for the government to urgently set up a food task force to provide food parcels for those who are self-isolating.

To address the lack of cash faced by those who have lost their jobs, the foundation and other campaigners have also called for an end to the five-week wait for universal credit -- the government benefit which 950,000 new claimants have applied for since March 16 -- and to double child benefit.

A government spokesman said: ""Public safety and making sure that those most at risk from the virus get the support they need is our top priority. We're working with the groceries industry, local government, local resilience and emergency partners to ensure essential items are delivered as soon as possible to the most vulnerable.""

Sabine Goodwin, co-ordinator of the Independent Food Banks Network, said the sharp increase in food poverty since the lockdown began had left food banks struggling to meet demand, at the same time as donations from members of the public had reduced.

Some independent food banks have seen demand increase in the past fortnight by as much as 3,000 per cent compared to the same time last year.

Experts have warned that a response that focuses only on food banks will fail to address the underlying causes of food poverty, and risk ""institutionalising"" food aid.

""The amount of people needing to go to food banks is not remedied by food banks,"" Ms Goodwin said. ""The problem is a lack of income and a lack of food. It stems from the fact that there is a level of poverty that is being ignored.""","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Lockdown'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_in_the_United_Kingdom', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Hunger in the United Kingdom'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Food security'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pandemic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'YouGov'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Executive director'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Independent politician'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Credit', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Universal Credit'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_benefit', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Child benefit'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Local government'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_bank', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Food bank'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'State school'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Virus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Aid'}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science', 'label': 'dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science', 'wgt': 42}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Consulting', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Consulting', 'wgt': 40}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Hunger_Relief', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Hunger Relief', 'wgt': 36}, {'uri': 'news/Politics', 'label': 'news/Politics', 'wgt': 87}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F6f700c4d-02e9-49bc-aca9-543e0716e5ee.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,eng-5672192,,{'facebook': 2528},-0.4431372549019608,2528,101

Rather than following the lead of many other major economies in implementing measures such as tax breaks and other stimulus to help private-sector companies survive the deep shocks caused by widespread shutdowns, the populist president on Sunday said he would prioritise social spending.

More than 2m personal, household and small business loans would be offered, including 25bn pesos ($1bn) to fund 1m loans for small businesses, and social programmes and handouts aimed at almost half the population that lives in poverty would be increased, he added.

He also said that the government would intensify housebuilding, public works programmes and his flagship airport, train and refinery infrastructure projects. The measures will create 2m new jobs, he said, without offering specifics. They will be funded by tighter government austerity and pay cuts for top officials rather than new debt.

Business leaders fear that by halting all but essential activities to slow the spread of coronavirus without major stimulus, as many as 1.2m jobs will be lost. Small and micro businesses account for seven out of 10 formal jobs and just over half of Mexico's gross domestic product. If those are driven out of business, more people may be pushed into poverty.

""What disappointed me is that these policies he's applying won't leave us with a future when this is over,"" said CuauhtÃ©moc Barrios, a 38-year-old entrepreneur in the northern city of Monterrey whose pallet business supplies a company making corn flour for tortillas.

Nathan Poplawsky, Mexico City head of the National Chamber of Commerce, estimated consumption is slumping by 2bn pesos a day in an economy that was already struggling before the pandemic hit.

Gabriela Siller, head of research at Banco Base, said in the worst case the economy could shrink as much as 10 per cent this year, its worst performance since a 14 per cent contraction in 1932.

""People need there to be jobs. I don't want money, I don't want [a government social] programme,"" said Mr Barrios, whose vote helped Mr LÃ³pez Obrador to a landslide victory in 2018.

Mexico's peso plunged to a new historic low of 25.8 to the dollar overnight as markets gave the thumbs-down to the president's plan. ""The later he reacts, the costlier this will be,"" said one of Mexico's top businessmen. ""What today is a liquidity crisis will quickly become a solvency crisis and recovery will take years.""

The leftist leader has insisted that Mexico is facing a ""transitory crisis"" despite criticism from various quarters, including doctors lacking protective equipment and waiters demanding aid.

""In spite of adversities, the transformation of Mexico will not be halted,"" Mr LÃ³pez Obrador said in his quarterly state of the nation speech on Sunday. ""We'll beat coronavirus. We'll reactivate the economy and Mexico will remain standing, showing the world its glory and grandeur.""

He added on Monday: ""We think [our plan] will be a model for other countries to follow.""

Mexico so far has 2,143 confirmed cases and 94 deaths from coronavirus. All but essential businesses have been ordered to shut until the end of April.

""There is no plan B. There is no plan A,"" said Carlos RamÃ­rez, head of Integralia, a consultancy and a former member of the government's financial stability council. ""Ideology is really interfering with key decisions,"" he said.

Mr RamÃ­rez said that Sunday's address to an empty patio -- crowds were banned because of coronavirus -- sent ""a very powerful message: I don't need anyone here. I call the shots"".

Business leaders say they do not want taxes waived, just a few months' relief so they can pay staff as their income dwindles.

But without their tax income, ""how will we give to the poor?"" the president asked.

""He's becoming more radical,"" said the senior business leader. ""Reality is going to catch up with us.""

Mexican workers, meanwhile, braced for pain ahead. ""The government said they'd help everyone,"" said Efigenio Arana, a carpenter, in a poor neighbourhood in Mexico City where many people work in the informal sector and cannot afford to abide by the government's exhortations to stay at home. ""Let's see if they take us into account.""

Joel GonzÃ¡lez, selling exhausts in a tiny shop and struggling to pay suppliers and cover overheads, was downbeat.

""There's no support from the government. There are going to be a lot of job losses.""","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_peso', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Mexican peso'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Small business'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Mexico'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Mexico'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AndrÃ©s_Manuel_LÃ³pez_Obrador', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pandemic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Bailout'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Latin America'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_tortilla', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Corn tortilla'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Oil refinery'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Flagship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_works', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Public works'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Austerity'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Entrepreneurship'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Private sector'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Chamber_of_Commerce', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United States Chamber of Commerce'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Flour'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CuauhtÃ©moc', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'CuauhtÃ©moc'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Welfare'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Populism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Gross domestic product'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Maize'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterrey', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Monterrey'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Monterrey'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Mexico'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Landslide victory'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_crisis', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Liquidity crisis'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Mexico City'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Mexico City'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Mexico'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_GonzÃ¡lez', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Joel GonzÃ¡lez'}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Small_Business', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Small Business', 'wgt': 23}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Associations', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Small Business/Associations', 'wgt': 20}, {'uri': 'news/Business', 'label': 'news/Business', 'wgt': 95}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F73499da8-d319-45d2-8f59-0bb2e5decf5a.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,eng-5663093,,{'facebook': 1761},-0.2235294117647059,1761,101

Over the past 10 days, up to two flights a day carrying Ethiopian migrants have landed at Addis Ababa international airport, before returning to Saudi Arabia loaded with cattle exports.

A total of 2,968 migrants were returned in the first 10 days of April, according to one UN official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the matter.

""This is simply not the moment for mass deportations from a public health perspective,"" said Catherine Sozi, UN humanitarian co-ordinator for Ethiopia. ""These mass deportations, without any pre-departure medical screening are likely to exacerbate the spread of Covid-19 to the region and beyond.""

A senior Saudi official said the kingdom was not conducting forced repatriations but was co-ordinating with countries if migrants wanted to return home.

""We are co-operating with individual countries to say 'do you want your people back, are you able to receive them, what can we help to enable them to come back?'"" the official said. ""And where countries have responded positively, we are organising flights, some of it we pay for to send them home, but we are not forcing people.""

Foreign workers account for about a third of Saudi Arabia's 30m population and more than 80 per cent of the kingdom's private sector workforce. Riyadh has imposed a strict lockdown to contain Covid-19 that has shuttered many areas of the economy, but businesses are eligible for government support to pay salaries.

""I don't think we will see in Saudi Arabia a significant number [of foreign workers] as a percentage going out,"" the Saudi official said. ""If we are to look at big picture in the next three months, I would not imagine anything more than 10 per cent going out because of flight capacity.""

Ms Sozi said the UN was calling for a temporary suspension of the deportations to give Ethiopian authorities time to plan properly for the migrants' safe repatriation. Ethiopia could not be expected to cope with the sheer number of deportations, she said.

""If you keep receiving 600-700 migrants a day and they all have to go into quarantine something will break,"" said one western official in Addis Ababa. ""The fear is that they will dump these people here and that the conditions in the quarantine centres will guarantee the spread of the disease.""

Ethiopia has requested that the deportations stop during the coronavirus crisis, and on Saturday denied landing rights to a Saudi aircraft, according to a person familiar with the deportations. The Ethiopian foreign ministry could not be contacted for comment.

The migrants are being taken to four quarantine centres in Addis Ababa in converted university buildings and schools. But officials who have been processing the migrants warn that conditions are becoming dangerously overcrowded and that the situation is reaching crisis point.

Some have tested positive for Covid-19 and others with symptoms of the disease have been put into separate isolation facilities. On one recent flight with 308 passengers, staff working for the World Health Organization identified seven people with suspected Covid-19 symptoms.

""Ethiopia's ability to respond is stretched to the limit,"" said one person with direct knowledge of the deportations. ""But everybody is scared of talking about what's going on. No one wants to be on the wrong side of Saudi Arabia.""

Saudi Arabia is an important investor in Ethiopia and has provided the government of Abiy Ahmed, prime minister, with help to alleviate the country's chronic shortage of foreign exchange.

Saudi Arabia began repatriating Ethiopian migrants from mid-2018, according to UN officials. At the time, there were as many as 500,000 Ethiopians in the kingdom working in the construction industry, as maids or as animal herders, they said.

As many as 300,000 Ethiopians had been repatriated during the past two years. Nearly 2m foreign workers have left the kingdom since the beginning of 2017 as Riyadh has implemented labour reforms and imposed tariffs on expatriates and their dependants.

But the Ethiopian government recently asked for a moratorium on deportations to stop the spread of coronavirus, UN officials said. Saudi Arabia had, if anything, stepped up repatriations in recent days, they added.

An estimated 30,000 Ethiopian migrants trying to reach Saudi Arabia are also trapped in Yemen, according to migrant officials. Some are being pushed further north towards Saudi Arabia while others are being moved south into Djibouti, which borders Ethiopia, they said.

Other Gulf states, emboldened by Saudi Arabia's actions, are also deporting Ethiopian migrants, UN officials added.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Deportation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Nations'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Saudi Arabia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Saudi Arabia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Ethiopia'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Ethiopia'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Repatriation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Quarantine'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Addis Ababa'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Addis Ababa'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Ethiopia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Private sector'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Cattle'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'International airport'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Public health'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Immigration'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Riyadh'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Riyadh'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Saudi Arabia'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiy_Ahmed', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Abiy Ahmed'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Prime Minister of the United Kingdom'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign exchange market'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'World Health Organization'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Construction'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_minister', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign minister'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Arab states of the Persian Gulf'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ethiopia', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Government of Ethiopia'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoralism', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Pastoralism'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Tariff'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Yemen'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Yemen'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djibouti', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Djibouti'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Djibouti'}}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Issues', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Issues', 'wgt': 8}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor', 'wgt': 14}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Officiating', 'label': 'dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Officiating', 'wgt': 8}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Sports/Officiating', 'label': 'dmoz/Sports/Officiating', 'wgt': 8}, {'uri': 'news/Business', 'label': 'news/Business', 'wgt': 49}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F623c9261-b766-447c-b88d-0a048dd98836.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,eng-5683869,,{'facebook': 1581},0.0117647058823529,1581,101

In exchange it gave the merchants who provided the money the exclusive right to print banknotes against this debt, giving birth to the central bank and much of the architecture behind the world's financial system. Today, as policymakers promise to do ""whatever it takes"" to prop up their economies in the face of coronavirus, central banks are facing calls to print money to finance government spending directly.

In times of emergency, particularly war, central banks have often handed freshly printed banknotes to governments. The fight against resultant inflation was postponed until after any crisis. Despite the pandemic, the world is not yet in that position today. There is no need, for now, to relax the framework of independent, inflation-targeting central banking. Yet this kind of monetary financing should be a tool available to policymakers, if needed.

Without limits, allowing a government to finance itself by creating money can lead to hyperinflation. But these risks can be manageable: the quantitative easing of the past decade, despite predictions, has not lifted inflation above the main central banks' 2 per cent targets. The money pumped into rich-world economies has been met by increased demand, perhaps permanently, for precautionary saving.

There is no clear distinction between quantitative easing and monetary financing. Central bankers say asset purchases under QE are temporary, meaning the newly-created money will one day be removed from the economy. But it is hard to bind the hands of their successors, who could one day make them permanent. Either way, the effect is to lower the cost of government borrowing. Buying the bonds only after they have been sold to private investors still frees up funds for new issues.

Recent QE programmes, in fact, look increasingly likely to become permanent. Central bankers were unable to complete a much-discussed programme of ""normalising"" monetary policy between the financial crisis and today's crash. They are not going to be able to do so any time soon. The scale of previous schemes means the Bank of Japan -- which holds government bonds worth more than 100 per cent of Japanese national income -- may never be able fully to unwind its purchases.

The difference between QE and direct monetary financing is mostly one of presentation: whether asset purchases are deemed temporary or permanent. This matters: credibility and messaging are important features of central banking. An opinion article this week by Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, that ruled out monetary financing may have been largely conceived to convince international investors that there is little reason to fear keeping funds in sterling.

If trends restraining inflation go into reverse, central bankers have tools to combat rising prices, whether through raising interest rates or unwinding QE. The present crisis may even be deflationary and central banks' targets are, with the exception of the European Central Bank, symmetric in promising to tackle inflation that is both below and above their stated goal.

The scale of today's downturn means even the most direct monetary financing, such as ""helicopter money"", or handing cash to the public, should remain an option. This will require co-ordination with democratically elected officials, who are responsible for the public finances. The debate should not be over whether monetary financing can happen -- in QE, it already is -- but over keeping the process under control via independent central banks.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Banknote'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Central bank'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Finance'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Quantitative easing'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Government of the United Kingdom'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Bank of England'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Inflation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hyperinflation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Government spending'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pound sterling'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007â€“2008', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Financial crisis of 2007â€“2008'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bank of Japan'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Government debt'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Government bond'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Bond (finance)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Monetary policy'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Interest rate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Governor'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Japan'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Japan'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_money', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Helicopter money'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Deflation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_finance', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Public finance'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'European Central Bank'}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Financial_Services', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Financial Services', 'wgt': 24}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Government/Finance', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Government/Finance', 'wgt': 37}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services', 'wgt': 25}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies', 'wgt': 22}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending', 'wgt': 23}, {'uri': 'news/Business', 'label': 'news/Business', 'wgt': 98}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F4aceab70-7811-11ea-bd25-7fd923850377?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,eng-5672900,,{'facebook': 1044},-0.05882352941176472,1044,52

Even these figures, running up to March 27 and verified by the Office for National Statistics, are an underestimate as they do not capture the total number of those who died with Covid-19 symptoms outside hospitals.

The latest ONS data showed 11,141 people died from all causes in England and Wales in the week to March 27, compared with the five-year average for that week of 10,130.

With 10 per cent more deaths registered in that week than normal, only one week in 2019 had a higher level of excess deaths, although there were many weeks with worse figures in the period of 2017-18 seasonal winter flu.

Every day, the count of new deaths has become one of the most highly watched statistics in Britain, but it reflects many deaths that happened days earlier, with an average delay of three days.

The Department for Health and Social Care said that the daily number of coronavirus hospital deaths on Tuesday was 786, taking the total number of UK hospital deaths to 6,159.

With coronavirus currently on the steep upward slope of an epidemic, the delays have resulted in a serious under-reporting of the daily number of deaths.

On March 28, the Department of Health and Social Care reported that in England 926 people had died in hospital from coronavirus in total by the previous day.

The latest figures, taking account of the date of death, show that in fact 1,649 people had died in English hospitals by March 27, a figure 78 per cent higher than originally reported.

The health department has continued to suggest its figures are up to date, saying on its website, ""the amount of time between occurrence of death and reporting in these figures may vary slightly and in some cases could be a few days, so figures at 5pm may not include all deaths for that day"".

The ONS figures suggest the average delay for all deaths in hospitals is roughly three days and the daily hospital death count has been much higher than the reported numbers while the death total has been accelerating.

Ultimately the total will be higher still when the ONS has final figures on the number of deaths outside hospitals, but this data has been significantly delayed because death registrations are more difficult under the lockdown that began on March 23.

""It takes time for deaths to be reported and included in ONS figures,"" the statistical office said.

Separately, Public Health England reports estimates for a concept of excess deaths, which it said were statistically significantly high in the week ending March 27 as a result of excess deaths of those aged over 65.

Matt Fletcher, senior longevity consultant at Aon, the pension advisers, said there was some evidence the speed of reporting of deaths had increased over the past week, which might explain the sudden sharp rise in reported hospital deaths.

With this in mind, he said it was best to use the NHS England statistics on the deaths when they occurred rather when first reported ""to illustrate progression of UK deaths and as a starting point for projections"".

The ONS said the daily counts were still useful ""because they are available very quickly"", while the figures adjusted for the date of death revealed the delays in reporting hospital deaths and gave ""a better indicator of the growth in the number of deaths"".

In time, it added, the ONS official figures on all deaths would provide ""the most accurate and complete information"".

In the data it had so far, the statistical office said that 4.8 per cent of death certificates notified to it so far for the week up to March 27 mentioned coronavirus, up from 1 per cent in the previous week.

Some 36 per cent of deaths notified to the ONS by that date and mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate were of those aged 85 or over; another 33 per cent were of those between 75 and 85 years of age. Only 12 per cent of deaths with coronavirus on the death certificate were aged under 65 with none aged under 15.

But the highest proportion of death certificates mentioning coronavirus was in the age group 65 to 74 years old, at 5.5 per cent, suggesting for this group there was an increased risk of death from the virus.

Men accounted for 62 per cent of all deaths, highlighting their increased susceptibility to the disease.

London was similarly a hotspot for the disease and for deaths, with Covid-19 mentioned on 18.3 per cent of all deaths in the capital in the week ending March 27.

In the data the ONS has to date, almost all the deaths were occurring in hospital, accounting for 501 of the 539 death certificates mentioning Covid-19.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Office for National Statistics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Hospital'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'England'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'England'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Social_Care', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Department of Health and Social Care'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Influenza'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Epidemic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'England and Wales'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'National Health Service (England)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_certificate', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Death certificate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Lockdown'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_England', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Public Health England'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Statistical significance'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Pension'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Virus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.london', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': '.london'}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life', 'wgt': 24}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice', 'wgt': 29}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs', 'wgt': 48}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences', 'wgt': 50}, {'uri': 'news/Health', 'label': 'news/Health', 'wgt': 91}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F10ee057c-02a8-459e-9d43-339a671ea434.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,eng-5666432,,{'facebook': 912},-0.2784313725490196,912,101

As the Covid-19 pandemic spreads around the planet, we have become part of a natural experiment. A virus has crossed the species line and is now travelling like wildfire through its new host. Normally, natural landforms such as mountains, oceans or canyons slow the spread of such outbreaks. But this virus has taken hold of a cosmopolitan species -- a highly mobile, super-numerous and super-networked one: humans.

We pay too little attention to the fact that our arrogant relationship with nature fuels, and even causes, many of humanity's greatest challenges. The threats we face are interrelated: climate change, the loss of biodiversity and the emergence of entirely new pathogens that threaten us time and again. Countries are flooded, forests burn, glaciers melt, oceans warm and insects die, all through our actions.

Pathogens break through species boundaries because we are exploiting natural resources without respect. For example, overfishing in the coastal waters of many African countries by foreign fleets leads local populations increasingly to turn to bushmeat for sustenance, increasing the likelihood (as with Ebola) that pathogens will be transmitted to humans.

Markets that trade wild animals as well as pets and farm animals are ideal locations for pathogens to cross boundaries. This was demonstrated in the Sars outbreak of 2002/2003, which some virologists attribute to contact with the civet cat that is eaten as a delicacy in parts of China. There are indications that the current coronavirus outbreak also spread to humans at a wildlife market in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

Our health and wellbeing as a species are linked to how we define our place in nature. Seeing ourselves as masters of our universe, we kill and sell whatever we want -- even if that is bats or pangolins. Billions of dollars' worth of wild animals and plants are traded globally. Not every trade contributes to the destruction of biodiversity, but unsustainable and ruthless trade in wildlife destroys the diversity of nature.

In October, China is due to host a meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity in Kunming. In addition to this global summit, known as the ""Davos of Nature"", a meeting on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Fair Distribution of Natural Resources will be convened there. The time and place seem ironic, given that China was the ground zero of a pandemic possibly caused by the illegal trade in wildlife.

But it is not appropriate to point fingers at a particular country. Governments have not typically been concerned with redefining their role in nature. We all carry on as before, taking nature's wealth for granted. We might acknowledge the threat of climate change, but most of us do not want to change anything fundamentally. A few promises here and bans there; a bit of money for the World Health Organisation; some more for research on infectious diseases.

In the midst of this crisis, it is becoming clear how irresponsible it is merely to accept the rapidly deteriorating state of our planet's biodiversity and the climate. For decades politicians have been hesitating. They insist that our economies and lifestyles can only gradually adapt. Yet, the coronavirus pandemic has shown that when danger is imminent, rapid and consistent action is possible.

Tackling climate change and enforcing measures against the illegal trade in wildlife is just as possible as using natural resources for the benefit of all people. We already have the technology; it is the will to act collectively that is lacking.

A global economic system based on the exploitation of nature will fail.

The city-state, which had won plaudits for its rapid initial response to the outbreak in January, has announced a near total lockdown after reporting a surge in new cases over the past few days. Total infections have jumped 60 per cent in the past week to 1,481, including 106 on Tuesday and 120 on Sunday, a record for a single day for Singapore.

""The trend is particularly concerning in the past week,"" said Gan Kim Yong, minister of health, citing the emergence of new clusters and the growing number of patients with no links to confirmed cases.

Singapore and Hong Kong were quick to use stringent travel restrictions, contact tracing and other measures to slow the spread of the disease and for a time appeared to have brought it under control.

But the two international financial centres are facing a sharp rise in locally transmitted cases after stemming imported infections, forcing them to implement this week their toughest distancing measures yet.

The escalation in the cities' responses comes as Austria, the Czech Republic and Denmark are set to become the first European countries to loosen restrictions on daily life and business.

Singapore on Tuesday evening passed a bill banning social gatherings of any size, while Hong Kong on Wednesday extended closures of entertainment venues and restrictions on public gatherings for another two weeks.

Hong Kong authorities on Wednesday said they had seen a ""drastic increase"" in the number of patients over the past fortnight from 387 to 936. ""Many of the cases are locally acquired infections without travel history,"" the government said.

The number of Singapore's locally transmitted infections has more than doubled in the past fortnight. They include new clusters at foreign worker dormitories, in which thousands of migrants live in often crowded rooms.

Authorities on Sunday put two of these dormitories housing 19,800 people in isolation for two weeks, during which time workers would not be able to leave their rooms. In the past three days, cases linked to foreign worker dormitories accounted for 35 per cent of newly reported patients.

Singapore has passed a bill valid for up to six months that prohibits social gatherings of any size among individuals not living in the same household in public and private spaces.

Offenders will face fines of up to S$10,000 (US$7,000) and/or a maximum jail sentence of six months in the first instance and double that for subsequent offences.

Singapore has also closed schools and most workplaces until May 4. People can only leave their homes for essential services, groceries or to exercise in the park at a safe distance.

Hong Kong's measures include shutting down establishments such as fitness centres, karaoke parlours and bars while restaurants must reduce seating capacity by 50 per cent and ensure tables are at least 1.5 metres apart. Those who do not comply with public gathering restrictions face a fine of HK$25,000 (US$3,200) or six months in prison.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Infection'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Singapore'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Singapore'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Migrant worker'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Hong Kong'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Hong Kong'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gan_Kim_Yong', 'type': 'person', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Gan Kim Yong'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Contact tracing'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_centre', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Financial centre'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Epidemic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'City-state'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Denmark'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Denmark'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Czech Republic'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Czech Republic'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Austria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Austria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_worker', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Foreign worker'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_dollar', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Singapore dollar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seating_capacity', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Seating capacity'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_dollar', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Hong Kong dollar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Karaoke'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_club', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Health club'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'United States dollar'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Restaurant'}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Issues', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Issues', 'wgt': 11}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor', 'wgt': 12}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Star_Clusters', 'label': 'dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Star Clusters', 'wgt': 10}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case_Management', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case Management', 'wgt': 11}, {'uri': 'news/Business', 'label': 'news/Business', 'wgt': 82}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9263b34d-6415-47da-8fd9-ecd82795bfbf.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,eng-5675884,,{'facebook': 769},0.06666666666666665,769,76

Mr Trump said the WHO had ""missed the call"" when it came to the early detection of the virus in Wuhan and called the organisation very ""China-centric"". He also blasted WHO for what he said was criticism of his decision in January to ban flights from China to the US.

""They could have called it months earlier,"" Mr Trump said at a White House press briefing on Tuesday. ""They would have known and they should have done. And they probably did know, so we'll be looking into that very carefully. And we're going to put a hold on money sent to the WHO.""

Mr Trump said he would put a ""very powerful hold"" on the funding. But when pressed on whether the US should withhold funds during the pandemic, the president softened his threat -- one of the many examples of the president contradicting himself during the same press conference.

""I'm not saying I'm going to do it, but we'll have a look,"" Mr Trump said. ""You know what, they called it wrong. And if you look back over the yearsâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰everything seems to be very biased toward China. It's not right.""

According to the WHO, the US, which is its biggest contributor, provided $58m to the organisation this year, or double the Chinese contribution.

His criticism reignited a debate about blame for the spread of the disease, which has been contracted by 1.43m people around the world and caused 82,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The number of US cases has soared to 398,000, while the death toll stands near 13,000.

The WHO in mid-January said there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, even after one of its experts said the opposite. Days later, it pointed to ""some limited"" direct transmission among humans, as China also confirmed the first cases of human-to-human transmission.

Later in January the WHO described the virus as a global emergency, but recommended that nations keep borders open to reduce the number of people crossing borders in irregular ways that would prevent health checks. Later that day Mr Trump banned most travel from China.

Mr Trump has been criticised for not taking the virus seriously early on, and particularly for saying it would disappear ""like a miracle"". Each time he has come under attack, he has touted his move to ban flights from China, and sometimes his later step to expand restrictions to travel from Europe.

""They seem to come down the side of China,"" said Mr Trump, who claimed that the WHO missed the early signs despite sending a team to Wuhan. ""They didn't see what was going on in Wuhanâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰How do you not see it?""

While Mr Trump has previously criticised the WHO, his attack on Tuesday took the criticism to a much higher level. It came just weeks after the US president generally stopped referring to the disease as the ""China virus"" following a phone call with Chinese president Xi Jinping.

China has sent ventilators and other badly needed medical equipment to the US to help states deal with the mounting health crisis.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'The Who'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'World Health Organization'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Donald Trump'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Wuhan'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Wuhan'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'China'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'China'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Virus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'White House'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Johns Hopkins University'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Europe'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China"", 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': ""President of the People's Republic of China""}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping', 'type': 'person', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Xi Jinping'}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Issues', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Issues', 'wgt': 11}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases', 'label': 'dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases', 'wgt': 11}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical', 'wgt': 12}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software', 'label': 'dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software', 'wgt': 12}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Conferences', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Conferences', 'wgt': 13}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F65c02ef1-b14f-43f8-8881-1600bdd8c445.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,eng-5667550,,{'facebook': 737},-0.1686274509803921,737,76

With about 5,000 coronavirus cases presenting every day and some intensive care wards already approaching capacity, doctors will score patients on three metrics -- their age, frailty and underlying conditions -- according to a chart circulated to clinicians.

Patients with a combined score of more than eight points across the three categories should probably not be admitted to intensive care, according to the Covid-19 Decision Support Tool, although clinical discretion could override that decision.

The UK is set to exceed 80,000 coronavirus cases on Sunday and 10,000 deaths in hospital with government models showing the peak of the outbreak is now expected to be reached over the next two weeks, leaving the healthcare system facing arguably its toughest challenge since its inception.

The scale of the pandemic and the speed at which Covid-19 can affect patients, has forced community care workers, GPs and palliative carers to accelerate difficult conversations about death and end-of-life planning among vulnerable groups.

The NHS scoring system reveals that any patient over 70 years old will be a borderline candidate for intensive care treatment, with a patient aged 71-75 automatically scoring four points for their age and a likely three on the ""frailty index"", taking their total base score to seven points.

Any additional ""comorbidity"", such as dementia, or recent heart or lung disease, or high blood pressure will add one or two points to the score, tipping them into the category suitable for ""ward-based care"", rather than intensive care, and a trial of non-invasive ventilation.

Although doctors and care workers stress that no patient is simply a number, the chart nonetheless codifies the process for the life-and-death choices that thousands of NHS doctors will make in the coming weeks.

A frontline NHS consultant triaging Covid-19 patients said the ""game-changer"" for assessment of patients with coronavirus was that there is no available treatment, meaning doctors can only provide organ support and hope the patient recovers.

""If this was a bacterial pneumonia or a bad asthma attack, then that is treatable and you might send that older patient to intensive care,"" the consultant said, adding that decisions on patients were ""art not science"" and there would be exceptions for patients who were fit enough.

""The scoring system is just a guide; we make the judgment taking into account a lot of information about the current 'nick' of the patient -- oxygenation, kidney function, heart rate, blood pressure -- which all adds into the decision making,"" he said.

But it is not just hospital doctors who must make tough decisions. GPs, hospice workers and families with vulnerable members are also involved.

Last week NHS England wrote to all GPs asking them to contact vulnerable patients to ensure that care plans and prescriptions were in place for end of life decisions, leading to many difficult conversations. These have been made harder by the need to conduct them on the phone or via Skype to observe social distancing rules.

Ruthe Isden, head of health and care at Age UK, the charity, said the need for haste had unsettled many elderly patients, who have felt under pressure to sign ""Do Not Resuscitate"", or DNR, forms.

""Clinicians are trying to do the right thing and these are very important conversations to have, but there's no justification in doing them in a blanket way,"" she said. ""It is such a personal conversation and it's being approached in a very impersonal way.""

The subject of DNR notices is particularly unsettling for individuals and families who want the best care for their loved ones, but often feel the choices have not been fully explained.

The data clearly show that resuscitation often does not work for elderly patients and can often cause more suffering -- including broken ribs and brain damage -- while extending life only by a matter of days.

Audrey, who cares for her 90-year-old mother in Tyne and Wear, north-east England, spoke about how her mother signed a DNR order during a recent visit to hospital but it had remained in place even after she had recovered and returned home.

""Mam asked me what CPR was,"" Audrey recalled, adding that no one from the hospital had contacted the family, raising worries about how actively her mother's consent had been obtained.

Carole Walford, the chief clinical officer at Hospice UK, a charity that provides end-of-life care to 225,000 families each year, acknowledged the difficulty of broaching the DNR question, but said the speed at which Covid-19 is advancing is leaving less time for niceties.

With some patients dying within 24 hours, decisions on whether to die at home or go to hospital or a hospice are being compressed in ways that are forcing hospice workers to change the way they prepare individuals for death and families for bereavement.

""Coronavirus is pushing us to the limit as we try to hold on to to the ethos and practice of palliative care,"" said Ms Walford, urging families to understand that demanding intensive care or hospital treatment might not be the best course of treatment.

Admission to hospital also means no contact with family, making homes -- rather than hospices or hospitals -- the haven for many patients.

""It's important that we don't see this as an 'either-or' decision. If someone is sedated and put on ventilation, is that better than having them on a ward or at home having a different death with dignity -- still able have their hair combed, their teeth cleaned, their hand held?"" said Ms Walford.

Despite the huge focus on building NHS capacity, the front line against coronavirus is often being fought in care homes and hospices already scarred by a decade of austerity that has placed immense strain on the social care system.

According to the Health Foundation, a charity, per person government spending was facing a Â£6bn shortfall by 2018, with local authority funding falling in real terms in a period when the over-85 population has risen by more than 14 per cent.

Even before the coronavirus pandemic caused up to 30 per cent of care home staff to report sick, the combination of spending cuts and low wages -- the average full-time care worker earns little more than Â£16,000 a year -- had left 120,000 vacancies across the sector.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_medicine', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Intensive care medicine'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'National Health Service'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Do not resuscitate'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_care', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'End-of-life care'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'General practitioner'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Decision-making'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-invasive_ventilation', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Non-invasive ventilation'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_pneumonia', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Bacterial pneumonia'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Life support'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Palliative care'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Triage'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Caregiver'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pandemic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Dementia'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Kidney'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hypertension'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospice', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hospice'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Health system'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Comorbidity'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_(England)', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'National Health Service (England)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_UK', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Age UK'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_England', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'North East England'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyne_and_Wear', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Tyne and Wear'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Tyne and Wear'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Health/Medicine', 'label': 'dmoz/Health/Medicine', 'wgt': 27}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities', 'label': 'dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities', 'wgt': 30}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Health/Home_Health', 'label': 'dmoz/Health/Home Health', 'wgt': 28}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Health/Home_Health/Home_Care', 'label': 'dmoz/Health/Home Health/Home Care', 'wgt': 28}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety', 'label': 'dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety', 'wgt': 35}, {'uri': 'news/Health', 'label': 'news/Health', 'wgt': 99}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fa04ab7be-e68f-41b6-8c01-bf94255ca750.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,,,{'facebook': 626},0.2,626,101

Flanked by senior government ministers, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz on Monday presented a timetable to restart the Austrian economy, detailing a series of phased steps to normalise life while minimising the risk of a surge in new infections.

With many European countries still battling to hold down cases of Covid-19, and hospital systems on the edge of capacity, Austria's plan will be intensely scrutinised: seen either as a bold decision to balance public and economic health, or as a gamble that prioritises the latter.

Several European countries have established task forces to look at how best to wind back containment measures, but faced with huge uncertainties, many officials have yet to commit to any clear strategy.

As well as pledging a gradual lifting of restrictions on public life, the Austrian plan also makes clear that months of controlling measures still lie ahead.

Mr Kurz urged Austrians to cancel any plans to celebrate Easter this week and stressed that restrictions could only be eased if rules were scrupulously adhered to. ""Keep to the measures, avoid social contacts, keep your distance in public space,"" the chancellor said.

According to the timetable, small shops will be permitted to open again from April 14 as well as large DIY stores and garden centres.

As of May 1, other businesses deemed slightly higher risk, including hair salons, will be allowed to reopen.

The government said there was a possibility restaurants and cafÃ©s would be allowed to start operating again in mid-May, but declined to give an exact date.

Public events will not be permitted to take place until July. No date has been set for schools to reopen.

The government also announced it would extend its requirement for Austrians to wear facemarks. In addition to their mandatory use in supermarkets and other shops that are currently open, they will also be required on all public transport.

Austrian authorities have so far confirmed 12,008 cases of the novel coronavirus.

Aggressive enforcement of containment measures, such as hefty police fines of thousands of euros, and well-resourced medical facilities, including one of the highest numbers of intensive care beds per capita in Europe, have proved relatively successful in limiting the impact of the virus in the central European country.

The Austrian growth rate of daily new infections has slowed to 2.8 per cent from more than 40 per cent in mid-March, health authorities reported on Sunday.

Mr Kurz's handling of the pandemic, and the performance of his health minister, the Green party's Rudolf Anschober -- has so-far won plaudits at home and abroad.

The country's fight against the novel coronavirus has not been without difficulty, however: the western mountainous region of Tyrol is one of the worst-afflicted areas in Europe.

Ski resorts in Tyrol -- packed with partying tourists from across the continent -- stayed open for days even after the first cases of coronavirus were confirmed there in the first week of March.

Some, such as Ischgl, have become bywords for politicians putting economic interests above public health -- a charge Mr Kurz's gambit to reopen the economy may yet encourage if infections in Austria tick up as restrictions on public life are lifted.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Austria'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Austria'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Austria', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Chancellor of Austria'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Kurz', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Sebastian Kurz'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Europe'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Austria', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Economy of Austria'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_store', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hardware store'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Pandemic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Chancellor'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Easter'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Infection'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Anschober', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Rudolf Anschober'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Salon (gathering)'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_medicine', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Intensive care medicine'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Coffeehouse'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Public transport'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Central Europe'}, 'location': None}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Virus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Supermarket'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Restaurant'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Euro'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrol_(state)', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Tyrol (state)'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Tyrol (state)'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Austria'}}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_resort', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ski resort'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Public health'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischgl', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Ischgl'}, 'location': {'type': 'place', 'label': {'eng': 'Ischgl'}, 'country': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'Austria'}}}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Public_Administration', 'label': 'dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Public Administration', 'wgt': 16}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Education', 'label': 'dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Education', 'wgt': 13}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Organizations', 'label': 'dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Organizations', 'wgt': 15}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Policy_and_Regulation', 'label': 'dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Policy and Regulation', 'wgt': 14}, {'uri': 'news/Business', 'label': 'news/Business', 'wgt': 76}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F944ca893-72e2-4650-adc0-0826efdb7c11.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,eng-5663304,,{'facebook': 515},0.2078431372549019,515,101

Mette Frederiksen, Denmark's centre-left prime minister, said on Monday night that children and adults at schools should be outside as much as possible, while there would be more distance between pupils inside.

""We are presenting a first, careful phase in the reopening of Denmark. It assumes that we are responsible and that the numbers [of sick] are stable, not just this week but for a long time to come. If we see over Easter that it is increasing, we won't reopen,"" she told a press conference.

Her comments came on the same day that Austria said it would start reopening shops from next week. Most shops in the Nordic countries have remained open throughout the outbreak and while schools and restaurants have been closed in Denmark, Norway and Finland -- but not Sweden -- people have been allowed to leave their homes when they like.

Norway is preparing to state on Wednesday if and how it will reopen schools or other institutions. Its health minister said the country had coronavirus ""under control"" with each person with it on average infecting less than one other person.

But many of the largest cities, such as Oslo and Trondheim, have argued that schools would not be able to reopen straight after Easter and would need time to prepare themselves.

Denmark will reopen kindergartens, crÃ¨ches and primary schools for first to fifth grades from Wednesday next week, Ms Frederiksen said.

The next phase of the reopening would be to look at restaurants and hairdressers, which are currently closed. Ms Frederiksen said the ban on large public gatherings would remain until August.

Other restrictions, such as the closure of secondary schools, libraries and churches, as well as a ban on gatherings of 10 or more people, will remain in place until at least May 10, the Danish prime minister added.

Ms Frederiksen said the idea behind the reopening was to delay the spread of the infection. ""We do not have a strategy that is about herd immunity,"" she added, referring to the idea -- pushed currently by Sweden and previously by some in the UK -- that it would help for the majority of the population to have had the virus.

""I do not believe we will return to the Denmark we knew before coronavirus,"" Ms Frederiksen said, adding: ""But it is also important that we do not keep Denmark closed for longer than we need to.""

Denmark was one of the first European countries to close its borders and Ms Frederiksen, in power in Copenhagen for less than a year, has won plaudits for her firm handling of the crisis.

At the end of 1665, after bubonic plague had taken off a quarter of London's population, he wrote in his diary: ""I have never lived so merrilyâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰as I have done this plague time.""

By December the great tide of death had abated but even as it had swept in months earlier, Pepys wrote of ""the greatest glut of content that ever I had"", adding, almost as an afterthought, ""only under some difficulty because of the plague"". He was a prosperous government official, member of the Navy Board during a maritime war with the Dutch; treasurer of the English colony at Tangier.

While Pepys had sent his wife downriver to Woolwich to escape the disease, he remained in London and continued to visit taverns and flirt his way through the evenings. He took what he thought were precautions, chewing tobacco and forgoing new wigs lest they be cut from the head of an infected body. On one occasion, ""I met a dead corpse of the plague in the narrow alleyâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰but I thank God I was not much disturbed at it.""

But in the last week of August, more than 6,000 had died from the plague and Pepys' imperviousness to melancholy was under strain. The few people he saw, he wrote, looked as if they had ""taken leave of the world"". He moved amid Buriers and Searchers, often elderly women assigned the dangerous job of examining the dead for signs of the plague, carrying long white wands to warn people to keep their distance as they went about their gloomy work. It was getting closer. His physician and the waterman who ferried him daily had both died, and Pepys decided to make a will.

His more austere friend, also a diarist, John Evelyn, Commissioner for Sick and Wounded Seamen, as well as for prisoners of war (many incarcerated in deathtrap confinement at Dover), looked on the ghastly spectacle in early September with a more tragic eye. Walking from Borough on the south side of the Thames to St James's was ""a dismal passage and dangerous to see so many coffins exposed in the streets, now thin of people; the shops shut up, and all in mournful silence, as not knowing whose turn might be next"".

Even in a statistically minded age (both were fellows of the newly founded Royal Society), Pepys and Evelyn knew that the vanishing act they were witnessing could not just be measured by the body count of the Mortality Bills. It was the city itself that was perishing, deprived of the oxygen of sociability.

Pepys took it hard when one of his favourite taverns, The Angell on Tower Hill, in common with many others, closed. He and many like him exemplified Aristotle's conviction that humans are, above all else, social animals; and that the vital energy of cities in particular comes from gatherings -- in public squares, theatres, sports stadiums -- where, through some collective elixir of attentive enthusiasm, individuals are lifted by the (not invariably) benign excitement of the crowd.

Take that away and what you were left with were buildings and the fearfully confined inside them. And what Pepys, in his reckless way, was determined to hold on to was that other basic cell of community, beyond individuals and family -- friendship.

A succession of writers from antiquity onwards celebrated friendship as the most life-enhancing social relationship of all.

The poet Horace's friendship with his wealthy patron Maecenas was the wellspring of some of his most affecting verse. Cicero was at pains to distinguish the real thing -- voluntary and entered into for nothing other than its own intrinsic pleasure -- from sensuality that could wither along with the exhaustion of lust, or connections based on utility.

The great essayist Michel de Montaigne went into deep grief at the loss of his friend Ã‰tienne de la BoÃ©tie and lamented in an essay on friendship that there was ""no action or imagination of mine wherein I do not miss him"".

And because, according to these champions of amity, disinterested friendship was intrinsically virtuous, it was the primary building block of strong societies; the place where personal pleasure and the common good nourished each other.

Acts of friendship were and are among the most painful casualties of epidemics. The earliest and most gripping account of plague, given by Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War, describes ""dejection of mind"" as its greatest misery, brought on by the fracturing of friendship. Those who visited the sick knew they were inviting a death sentence on themselves. But those who had no visitors ""died forlorn"".

Our generation of the plagued is more fortunate. For once, the grotesque debasement of what it means to be befriended on social media has something going for it. FaceTime, Skype, Instagram and Zoom allow comforting visits to the sick and distressed in ways denied to Thucydides' stricken Athenians or Pepys' Londoners walled in, as they were, behind the red cross daubed on their doors.

Since the appearance of a whole slew of books on the subject, beginning with Hans Zinsser's Rats, Lice and History (read at college half a century ago), William McNeill's Plagues and Peoples and Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, it's become a commonplace that epidemics are the great re-setters of history, more formative even than wars or revolutions. The lack of immunity of indigenous American peoples to the lethal diseases brought by European conquistadors in the 16th century was unquestionably decisive in their defeat and subjugation.

But the pandemic of 1918, horrifying as it was, did little to affect political and social alterations already made by the war. And some things remained constant before, during and after the plague, notably the starkly differing experiences of rich and poor.

A standard feature of the ""Dances of Death"" imagery that became popular after the arrival of the Black Death in Europe in 1348 was the indifference of the plague to rank, wealth and authority, indiscriminately mowing down popes and emperors at the height of their powers, along with peasants and beggars.

But it's equally true that if you had the means to escape the urban hotspots of infection, you had a much better chance of survival than if you were stuck in the urban swarm. The ancestors of today's escapees to New York summer homes were panic-stricken passengers in coaches and private carriages jamming the exits from the city when the first big wave of cholera struck in 1832.

While the epidemics differ in their origins, virulence and duration, and while the understanding of how they arise and in what form they are carried has changed dramatically over the centuries, to a remarkable degree the social danse macabre following the shock of impact has stayed much the same. It's a square dance along a quadrilateral formed by political power, economic desperation, religious fervour and medical understanding. Each of those institutional communities does what it can to minimise the damage to their authority. But what happens when they interact is less predictable.

The first reaction of western rulers whose best-laid plans are frustrated by epidemic has been, almost invariably, to blame Asians and to adopt the blustery vocabulary of war. There is, in fact, a dramatic founding history behind this militarisation of medical crisis. In 1346, Genoese merchants and soldiers had locked themselves inside the Crimean fortress city of Caffa (now Feodosia) to defend themselves against a siege by the Mongol army of Jani Beg.

Before they could press their advantage of numbers, the besiegers were struck down by a brutal wave of bubonic plague, a contagion which had been endemic along the Silk Road for at least 20 years.

According to Gabriele de Mussi of Piacenza, who probably wrote his account two years later, ""the dying Tartars, stunned and stupefied by the immensity of the disasterâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰ordered corpses to be placed in catapults and lobbed into the city in the hope that the intolerable stench would kill everyone inside"". What seemed like ""mountains of dead"" were thrown into the city.

This was the earliest documented act of biological warfare and, according to de Mussi's narrative, the Black Death subsequently travelled to Christian Europe through survivors of the siege. In fact, it was likelier that the Genoese carried the disease in the hold of their ships, where fleas living on the bodies of black rats were the carriers of the fatal bacillus. But the history established the notion, still current in the Trumpian branding of coronavirus as ""Wuhan"" or ""Chinese"", that somehow the epidemic is a tool of ruthless oriental strategy.

The hitherto unknown strain of cholera that ravaged the world in the 19th century originated in British-controlled Bengal in 1817, and may have been carried west on European steam shipping. By the end of that century, however, it was not uncommon to refer to cholera as an Asiatic act of revenge for the humiliations of imperial domination.

If scapegoating was always going to be a predictable response of plague-beleaguered powers, the inevitable target of blame was the Jews. At the time of the Black Death, they were accused in some places of poisoning wells; in others it was said that they had introduced the disease out of sheer malevolence towards Christians.

The consequences, even by the standards of persecution endemic in the medieval Christian world, were horrific. From Spain to the Rhineland, in Switzerland and Bavaria, Jews were the victims of massacre and, very often, burnings alive. In Strasbourg, 2,000 were slaughtered; in Basel, 130 children were separated from their parents before 600 adults were burnt. In the single village of TÃ rrega in Catalonia, virtually the entire community of 300 Jews were killed by assault or burning.

Other times, other epidemics, found other victims. Outbreaks of cholera in American cities such as Boston and New York were blamed on the immigrants, most often Irish, who of necessity were packed together in insanitary conditions. The nativist Know-Nothing movement was fired up by attacking Irish migrants as a double threat to Protestant Anglo-America; as the carriers of both popery and disease.

John Pintard, one of the founders of the New-York Historical Society, who remained in the city through the 1832 epidemic, believed the infection would of itself purify the population and act as a prophylactic against future outbreaks harming the better sort of people. ""Those sickened must be cured or die off,"" he wrote, ""and being chiefly of the very scum of the city, the quicker [their] dispatch, the sooner the malady will cease.""

The pious and the powerful often, but not invariably, held up their hands in horror. Pope Clement VI forbade attacks on Jews and insisted that since they had suffered at least equally if not more seriously than Christians from the plague, why would they be responsible for their own suffering? But it suited other authorities to let popular hatred run its course along with the infection; just as the better off and the better educated were sometimes prepared to endorse the idea that immigrants were, by the very fact of their arrival and lodging in crowded quarters, tantamount to an invasion force armed with disease. Better that outsiders should be blamed.

Nonetheless, the powerful did not escape blame for the calamity. If the plague was commonly believed to be God's punishment for the sins of egregious wealth, debauchery and overweening pride, popular preaching held the stewards of both church and state to be complicit in these transgressions. Humility and self-mortification were needed. Processions of flagellants, hundreds in number, made their way through cities including Florence, thrashing their bodies with metal-studded flails, in bloody reproof of bishops and abbots.

Painting and tomb sculpture brought the warnings of the dead into the world of the living. ""Transi"" tombs placed sculptures of decaying cadavers lying immediately beneath the grander likenesses of the deceased. In the Campo Santo cemetery at Pisa, Francesco Traini's terrifying ""Triumph of Death"" (painted before 1348), in which grandly dressed types beheld open coffins containing corpses in various states of decomposition, took on freshly urgent meaning.

In the midst of calamity, economics was always at loggerheads with the interests of public health. Even though, until there was an understanding of germ-borne diseases, the plague was mostly attributed to ""foul air"" and noxious vapours said to arise from stagnant or polluted marshes, there was nonetheless a sense that the very commercial arteries that had generated prosperity were now transformed into vectors of poison.

But when quarantines were proposed or imposed (an invention of the same northern Italian towns and ports that have suffered most brutally from our own pandemic), those who stood to lose most, merchants and in some places artisans and workers, from the stoppage of markets, fairs and trade, put up stiff resistance.

Must the economy die so that it could be resurrected in robust good health? Yes, said the guardians of public health, who became part of urban life in Europe from the 15th century onwards.

When the last major outbreak of bubonic plague in western Europe appeared in Marseille in 1720, the regent, Philippe of Orleans, not renowned for his public-spiritedness, appointed one of his generals, Charles de Langeron, to take command of the emergency, put a quarter of the royal army at his disposal, established a ""Council of Health"" in Provence, and shut down travel and trade between the port and towns like Aix, Montpellier and Arles.

Not all of the prophylactic remedies were of much avail. Plague walls were built to prevent the entry of travellers to provincial towns such as Aix and Arles, but the disease penetrated the cities nonetheless. The crew of the ship thought to have brought the plague were confined to a lazaretto offshore, more or less guaranteeing mass mortality. And a general massacre of cats and dogs was no help at all. But de Langeron was praised for being publicly conspicuous in the hotspots, ""on his horse from morning till nightâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰scornful of danger, to remedy ills that seemed insurmountable"", and compared to the most virtuous consuls of antiquity.

In the long term, the idea that state and local governments should, as part of their brief, become specialised institutions for public health, which in times of pestilence would gather reliable information on the source of infection and be able to map its spread as a precondition of remedial policy, was a crucial legacy.

Which is not to say that empirical science always has its way in its toils with piety, profit and power. Even though the physician John Snow conclusively traced back the cholera infection of 1854 to those who had used a single water fountain at Broad Street in Soho, and established that the water company servicing that pump had been using dangerously tainted water from the sewage-riddled gunk of the Thames, his principal argument that the disease was conveyed in faecally polluted water took a while to be accepted.

For some time now, the cult of the individual and the hollowing out of government, the better to strip away any impediments to the optimisation of profit, has been riding high. The global trauma of the pandemic may well move things in the opposite direction, towards a greater acceptance of government intervention, a trend which can either become baleful -- as it already has in the illiberal authoritarianism just instituted in Hungary -- or benign, with policy, both preventive and reactive, based on the authority of knowledge.

And there is something else, evident in much of the public response in this time of profound distress, which may yet arise from the ashes of our complacency, and that is the quality most important to Adam Smith (sometimes misunderstood as the high priest of individualism), which in The Theory of Moral Sentiments he called ""sympathy"".

However selfish man be supposed, he wrote, ""there are evidently some principles in his nature which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it. Of this kind is pity or compassion, the emotion which we feel for the misery of othersâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰That we often derive sorrow from the sorrow of others is a matter of fact too obvious to require any instances to prove it; for this sentiment, like all the other original passions of human nature, is by no means confined to the virtuous and humaneâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰The greatest ruffian, the most hardened violator of the laws of society, is not altogether without it.""

In the pit of our common trepidation, we must hope he is right.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Evelyn', 'type':

The silver-haired billionaire was so concerned about the economic fallout that he even contemplated selling all of the holdings at the investment group he founded almost two decades ago.

Instead, working from his study at home, Mr Ackman made a series of trades designed to ""hedge"" Pershing Square's portfolio, that is, to protect it in the event of a market sell-off. Within a month, the trade had reaped $2.6bn of profits, captivating the hedge fund world and thrusting one of its most controversial stars back into the limelight.

New information, published in Mr Ackman's letter to investors this week, shows the impact it had on Pershing Square's portfolio. While its assets are worth just 3 per cent more than they were at the start of the year, it used profits from the trade to vastly increase its stakes in some of America's most famous companies at knockdown prices. This has set Mr Ackman up to win a second time if he is right and the economy rebounds quickly once the coronavirus shutdown is lifted.

Mr Ackman declined to comment for this article.

The coronavirus hedge marked the first time that Pershing Square had wagered in credit default swaps since the financial crisis.

At first glance, it was an unusual move for an activist investor who made his fortune by taking big bets on equities, then loudly and publicly defending his point of view. But the mere scale of the latest trade bore the hallmark of an investor whose career has turned on a small number of large bets.

Mr Ackman quietly scooped up a set of huge insurance policies linked to $71bn of corporate debt -- ten times Pershing Square's assets under management. By the time he exited the position, he had paid only $27m in premiums.

The hedge fund industry is no stranger to big bets. Whereas hedge fund manager John Paulson's financial crisis era ""big short"" was a highly-complex wager that the US housing market would collapse, Pershing Square's trade was an opportunistic attempt to protect itself using standard derivative contracts.

Big US banks -- primarily Citi, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America -- helped Mr Ackman quietly amass the positions. The institutions on the other side of the trade were told their new counterparty was investing outside its normal area of expertise and was willing to pay slightly over the odds for protection against a deterioration in the economic outlook. The three banks declined to comment.

The firepower and flexibility to take this view at scale was enabled by Pershing Square's unusual structure. Unlike most hedge funds, which can face calls from investors to retrieve their money, it raised $2.8bn in a Netherlands stock market listing in 2014. This gave it permanent capital to invest.

The sort of insurance policies Pershing Square purchased are linked to indices of corporate bonds and are widely traded, in many cases easier to buy and sell than the individual bonds on which they are based.

Conditions for borrowers had been so good for so long that the price to insure against them defaulting was close to the lowest it has ever been: around 50 basis points of the insured amount for investment grade debt, per year.

According to a person familiar with the trades, Pershing Square built up CDS on $50bn of US investment grade debt, a $18.5bn position in the equivalent European index, and a $2.5bn notional exposure to Europe's high-yield debt.

Such policies typically last for five years, but Pershing Square paid less than the first month's $40m premium. By early March, investors were waking up to the implication that stopping the spread of Covid 19 meant entire industries, including airlines, travel and hospitality, would essentially shut down for an unknown period.

In short order the cost of insuring debt quadrupled. ""In the first couple of weeks of March there were a lot of buyers and very few sellers"", said David Riley, a partner at BlueBay Asset Management.

Mr Ackman had to stomach huge swings in the value of the firm's CDS position as US markets leapt and plunged as well as an enormous $485m yearly premium if he was forced to hold on to it for longer than anticipated.

On March 13, for example, the S&P 500 rose 10 per cent in a day and the value of Pershing Square's contracts dropped by $800m, a person familiar with the firm said. This was a hair-raising amount of volatility for a position that had come to represent about 40 per cent of the firm's assets at its peak.

Mr Ackman began to sell as fast as he could without alarming the market and after offloading the insurance policies, he had booked a $2.6bn profit.

By the time Mr Ackman made an emotional appearance on CNBC on March 18, he had sold about half the position. His voice cracked as he called on governments ""to shut the world for 30 days"" to avoid human and economic disaster. Commentators suggested he was trying to send the markets lower, but Mr Ackman told CNBC he was ""aggressively buying stocks"". He later added on Twitter that he saw ""bargains of a lifetime"". The newly-bullish stance was prompted by what he perceived to be encouraging signs that the Trump administration was dealing with the economic fallout of coronavirus.

The hedge fund manager doubled down on existing positions in his portfolio -- companies that had been hurt by the market sell-off but had business models he believed would thrive in the long term. This included hotel group Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, and property group Howard Hughes Corporation. Pershing Square also bought back into Starbucks, the coffee chain that it had sold out of at almost twice the price earlier this year.

These concentrated positions are characteristic of Mr Ackman, whose reputation was made on spectacular bets, such as a $60m investment in General Growth Properties, a bankrupt mall operator that Pershing helped rescue in 2009, which would eventually be worth $3.6bn.

Despite Mr Ackman's strong long-term record -- Pershing Square has recorded annual investment gains of 14.5 per cent -- there have been bumps along the way. Mr Ackman and his co-investors lost almost all of $2bn spent on financial derivatives related to Target, after an activist campaign seeking changes at the US retailer fizzled out.

Then after Pershing Square gained a whopping 40 per cent in 2014, it subsequently suffered a string of bad years, wrong-footed by big bets on pharmaceutical company Valeant, and Herbalife, the multilevel marketing group. Mr Ackman spent enormous amounts of time and money in a high-profile campaign to persuade the US government to investigate what he alleged was a pyramid scheme.

Brent crude was 4.5 per cent higher at $34.36 a barrel by lunchtime in London, while West Texas Intermediate gained 7.6 per cent to just shy of $27 a barrel. But both benchmarks have lost half their value since the start of the year as the market wrestles with cratering demand and record oversupply amid a price war.

Traders have been betting for the past week that a deal to cut supply by up to 15m barrels a day could be reached, helping to drag crude off an 18-year low near $20 a barrel. But significant hurdles remain to such a global agreement, which would equate to roughly 15 per cent of global pre-crisis supplies.

Donald Trump, the US president, has put pressure on Russia and Opec's largest member Saudi Arabia to forge a pact to cut 10-15m barrels a day of output. Both Riyadh and Moscow have insisted other countries, including the US, participate.

The US has indicated that its own production is likely to fall anyway due to the precipitous fall in prices, which has upended the global oil industry, with demand seen down by around a third globally due to virus shutdowns and flight bans.

But Russian officials have pushed back against what they see as the US and other countries like Canada dressing up natural production declines as mandated cuts, even as Moscow indicated it would be willing to reduce its own output by up to 15 per cent. The deal could hinge on every side accepting the others' definition of what constitutes a supply cut.

Some traders believe that the likely outcome will therefore be a fudge. Helima Croft at RBC Capital Markets said she expected the ""meetings will yield a broad framework agreement to curb output by a big headline number"", but that it would ""likely be short on hard specifics such as duration, implementation timeline, and enforcement mechanisms.""

Energy ministers from the G20 group of the world's wealthiest countries are due to meet on Friday for the first time ever after the so-called Opec+ group convenes today. The International Energy Agency and Saudi Arabia -- which holds the rotating presidency of the G20 -- are pushing for action.

The price crash has put millions of jobs in the energy sector under threat and risks causing uncontrolled shutdowns of oilfields around the globe as storage capacity runs out. That could damage fields in the long term, analysts say.

The Kremlin on Thursday reiterated its stance that all major oil producers must take part in any reduction deal. ""Our position is clear: Russia stands for joint co-ordinated actions in the interests of stabilising the global energy market,"" said Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Mr Peskov declined to answer a question regarding whether Mr Putin had held discussions with the leaders of other oil-producing countries outside of Opec, aside from Mr Trump.

Mr Trump has repeatedly stressed he believes ""free markets"" will force a deal as the collapse in demand means Saudi Arabia and Russia will find few buyers for their crude. Global storage threatens to be overwhelmed within weeks or at best months.

But Mr Trump has also held out the threat of tariffs on oil from Saudi Arabia and Russia, blaming them for starting a price war after they moved to raise production last month, despite falling demand.

Goldman Sachs warned this week that the hit to demand meant that a cut of 10m barrels a day ""would not be sufficient"" even though it would be by far the largest supply agreement in history.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Barrel'}}, {'uri':

Below I've tried to capture some of the transformations in western societies since March.

What follows isn't a catalogue of utopian dreams (though we need those), or shortlived moral awakenings. Rather, it's a list of changes that have actually happened, should last, will save time or money and can mitigate horrors such as carbon emissions, loneliness and homelessness.

* Working from home. For a week it's an experiment, but after nearly a month it starts to become institutionalised, even in professions that had never contemplated it before.

The British cabinet now meets on Zoom, court hearings have shifted online and bank staffers are executing transactions from home over secure systems. All this has happened unplanned, while many employees are looking after children all day. Homeworking will be easier after the pandemic.

If white-collar employees end up working from home just half the week, the fall in commuting would slash emissions, pollution and rush-hour traffic while boosting national happiness.

When psychologist Daniel Kahneman and economist Alan Krueger asked 900 Texan women in 2006 to rate their enjoyment of ordinary activities, sex ranked first and commuting last. Morning commutes appeared ""particularly unpleasant"". Ex-commuters would save fortunes on cars, and free up time in manifold ways.

Most lowly-paid employees -- such as cleaners, cashiers and waiters -- can't work from home. But if white-collar workers shift their activity from city centres to residential neighbourhoods, support jobs will follow. Anyone still commuting to downtown will find roads and trains emptier.

* Telemedicine. The pandemic has sparked an almost instant time-saving revolution in medical care. Telemedicine works ""for most medication refillsâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰urinary tract infections, colds and rashes, diabetes and hypertension follow-ups, lab results, post-op visits, birth control and fertility, and mental health,"" says the website Medicaleconomics.com.

Older people -- many of whom have undergone an involuntary crash course in videoconferencing -- will spend less time in germ-filled waiting rooms. Their children (generally daughters) can sit in on the calls instead of ferrying parents to and from appointments.

* Better hygiene. Coronavirus contrarians always point out that the ordinary flu kills thousands too. That's true. However, it isn't a good argument against lockdowns during far deadlier Covid-19. Rather, it's an argument for reducing flu deaths (and misery, and lost working days) in normal times.

We now know how to do it: more handwashing; masks and self-isolation for infectious people whenever possible; and better availability of flu vaccines.

* Volunteering. When the British government asked for 250,000 volunteers to help the National Health Service during the pandemic, three times that number applied.

Some argue that a state service shouldn't need volunteers, at least not in normal times. But we live in a century of unprecedented leisure (chiefly among the over-sixties) and a waning sense of community.

Many people would rather help their society than moan about it from the sofa. Volunteering is a way to convert leisure into community. It also reduces loneliness, including among volunteers.

* Checking on the elderly. Even before lockdowns, many older people often went days without speaking to anyone. Now countless WhatsApp groups are reaching out to isolated neighbours.

In my building, there's a sign downstairs asking if anyone wants help. In Ireland, postal workers have begun checking on the elderly, asking whether they need food, a pharmacy or a way to send messages. After the pandemic, these cost-free systems could allow more people to grow old at home rather than in expensive and often depressing retirement homes.

* Curbing domestic violence. Lockdowns have worsened domestic violence, but have also alerted countries to an eternal plague. Better late than never, France has hurriedly enabled victims to seek help in pharmacies (using code words if necessary) and shopping malls.

* Emptying American jails and housing the homeless. Since the 1960s, the US has created a vast government-funded prison-industrial complex to control poor people, many of them African-Americans.

The US incarcerates more inhabitants per capita than any other country, yet still has high rates of violent crime. Now that prisons have become virus incubators, many states are releasing nonviolent and elderly offenders, and arresting fewer new ones.

Meanwhile, California has begun using federal funds to house some homeless people in hotels and motels. It's also considering buying rooms for the long term. ""This was the crisis we needed to address before the Covid-19 crisis,"" says the state's governor Gavin Newsom. For plutocratic San Francisco to have 8,000 people living on the streets and in shelters was a choice.

Even leaving aside morality, it's easier for people to deal with addiction and find work once they have a place to live. And the new policy should save California money, given how many emergency-room visits the homeless make. Some good ideas really were just lying around waiting to happen.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic', 'type':

Updated guidance for employers issued by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy this week states that ""if contractually allowed, your employees are permitted to work for another employer whilst you have placed them on furlough"", following requests from industry groups for clarification of these workers' status.

However, the new guidance does not go as far as some sectors had requested. Care providers have called for legislation to ensure furloughed individuals wishing to work for the National Health Service or social care providers can do so regardless of the terms of their existing job contracts.

Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, which represents more than 3,700 social care providers, last week warned that the sector was ""already facing critical shortages of staff because of the requirement to self-isolate if a family member has or is suspected of having Covid-19"".

The National Farmers' Union said that despite the lack of legislation, the latest move would help pave the way to hire local workers for some 70,000 to 80,000 seasonal harvesting roles normally filled by migrants, many of whom will be unable to travel this year.

Universal credit applications in the UK surged to 10 times their normal level in the two weeks to April 1, but millions of people are also set to be furloughed, with their jobs placed on hold and 80 per cent of their salaries paid under a government scheme launched because of coronavirus.

The crisis looks set to prompt mass transfers of workers from sectors that are unable to operate, such as food service and hospitality, to those needing more labour than usual, such as healthcare and food retail.

Farmers had been concerned they would be forced to let crops rot, after border closures, transport cancellations and the fear of infection reduced the flow of eastern European migrant workers to a trickle.

Tom Bradshaw, vice-president of the National Farmers' Union, said: ""Growers that rely on seasonal workers to grow, pick and pack our fresh fruit, veg and flowers are extremely concerned about the impact coronavirus restrictions may have on their ability to recruit this critical workforce this season.""

But Stephanie Maurel, chief executive of the work placements charity Concordia, said 26,000 people had already applied through a recruitment drive launched with two other agencies. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, working with industry bodies, will launch an online portal this month to match workers with roles picking fruit and vegetables.

The Road Haulage Association said more flexibility was needed for haulage companies to call back furloughed employees for jobs such as transporting medical supplies. ""The volumes are so volatile, we need that flexibility,"" said Richard Burnett.

Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute, on Thursday announced details of three serological tests -- one of blood donations, one involving four areas of the country that had seen large outbreaks of the virus and a representative study of the broader population.

In determining infection rates, experts currently use models based on data that can quickly become obsolete or incomplete, and they have long argued that spot checks and randomised tests are a better approach.

But no country has successfully implemented a nationwide antibody testing programme.

Germany has already emerged as a leader in testing for coronavirus itself, carrying out up to 100,000 tests per day, according to health minister Jens Spahn.

The aim of the Sars-CoV-2 antibody test programme is to find out how many Germans are immune to the virus and ""how large the proportion of asymptomatic cases is -- that is of people who were infected by the virus but didn't know it"", Dr Wieler said.

The tests would also shed more light on how many people in Germany had died, so how high the mortality rate was, he added.

All three studies will be carried out jointly by the Robert Koch Institute, the Institute of Virology at CharitÃ© Hospital in Berlin and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig.

In the first, up to 15,000 samples will be taken every 14 days from blood donations. The second will concentrate on four areas worst affected by Covid-19, with representative blood samples taken from about 2,000 people. For the first and second surveys, work will start next week, with the first results expected in May.

In the third, 15,000 people in 150 regions across Germany will be tested for antibodies. Work is to start next month.

Mr Wieler said the tests would allow health authorities to ""better describe the course of the epidemic and get to know it better"". It would also allow researchers more effectively to evaluate measures taken to slow the spread of the virus and provide more information about unrecorded cases that were not reflected in official statistics, he added.

Establishing how far the virus has spread and how many of those infected died will help authorities decide when they can allow people to return to normal life.

In the US, the Centers for Disease Control is also carrying out antibody testing. One survey involves blood samples from people not diagnosed with the virus in coronavirus hotspots, the second is a national survey from different parts of the country and the third a study of health workers.

Earlier this week, Finland announced a similar antibody testing programme, albeit on a smaller scale, with the aim of testing a randomly selected sample of 750 individuals per week, Finnish broadcaster Yle reported.

Tim Colbourn, an associate professor at University College London's Institute for Global Health, said it would be ""really helpful"" to know what actual infection rates were through random antibody testing.

""Efforts to measure prevalence of Covid infection through random sampling of the population will shed light on this key unknown,"" he said.

A better idea of infection rates could help identify clusters and target health interventions, he added.

Other countries have announced plans to carry out nationwide tests but struggled to get them off the ground. India announced on April 4 that it would start rapid antibody tests of people reporting coronavirus symptoms in ""containment zones"" -- hotspots with a cluster of infections -- and in large migration centres. It put out a tender for the tests last month.

But it has yet to ramp up capacity and faces significant logistical challenges after Narendra Modi, prime minister, put the country on a strict 21-day lockdown that has disrupted supplies of testing kits.

Some governments have seen antibody tests as a crucial stepping stone to relaxing some of the harsher lockdown measures introduced throughout the world to curb the pandemic.

One of the main caveats is that scientists haven't reached a uniform consensus on whether immune responses to Sars-Cov2 are adequate and sustained.

But, say experts, greater testing and a more thorough epidemiological picture would help health authorities respond more quickly and stem clusters and outbreaks before they surged.","{'uri': 'ft.com',

Mr Tres and his family have run Netexpres, a cleaning firm, for 40 years. Before the pandemic took hold, the company employed some 400 workers from its base near Barcelona airport. Over half have now been furloughed as shopping malls, sports venues, gyms, restaurants and government offices have been closed down.

Normally 30 staff clean two huge installations that prepare 10,000 aeroplane and airport meals a day. But now, with the airport stilled, ""it is just two people cleaning for four hours, to keep the rats away"", says Mr Tres.

He worries that an already dramatic surge in Spanish unemployment will rise still further as the country's three-week-old lockdown goes on and companies fold. ""We've survived a lot of things: recession in 1992, the financial crisis,"" he adds. ""But I've never been so scared.""

UniCredit research published this week suggests that Spain is set to suffer more from the crisis than any other European economy, estimating a 15.5 per cent decline in gross domestic product this year and a fiscal deficit of 12.5 per cent of GDP.

Other economists argue that a 10 per cent drop in output and a deficit of 10 per cent of GDP are likely. That would bring total debt to at least 120 per cent of GDP -- up from a previous level of just under 100 per cent -- even before measures to rebuild the economy are contemplated.

Social security figures last week showed that more than 800,000 people have already lost their jobs out of a labour force of around 19m. Meanwhile the government is supporting the income of some 6m people, whether through temporary lay-off schemes, tax holidays or increased benefits. Unemployment in Spain was already 14 per cent before the crisis hit.

Such figures are a big reason why, despite resistance from northern Europe, Madrid is pushing for mutualisation of debt and EU-backed ""coronabonds"" -- an agenda on which Eurozone finance ministers signally failed to agree in an all-night meeting that ended on Wednesday morning.

""The general fact that we are looking at a contraction in the economy, although we can't yet know the size -- as well as the extraordinary government spending -- means that there will be a rise in public debt as a proportion of GDP,"" said Cristina Herrero, the president of Spain's Independent Authority for Fiscal Responsibility, the equivalent of the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility.

""The limited fiscal space relative to other countries is a big part of the reason why Spain wants eurobonds, coronabonds, mutualisation of debt.""

She added in an interview that, before the economic impact of the crisis could be determined, ""we need to know how long the shutdown is going to last, whether there will be another outbreak, and what measures are going to be in place when people do go out of their homes"". The OECD estimates that for each month of lockdown, countries can expect to lose two percentage points of annual growth.

But Ms Herrero also emphasises that Spain's economy is particularly vulnerable, because of ""the high proportion of people on temporary contracts; the role of the service sector, including tourism, which has been very badly hit; and the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises"".

More than a quarter of Spain's workforce is on temporary contracts, the highest level in the EU, and at times of stress the easiest way for companies to cut back on labour costs is to sack such people rather than to reduce salaries or the working week. According to last week's figures, the number of people on temporary contracts has already declined by 17 per cent, compared with just a 2 per cent fall in permanently employed staff.

Meanwhile, tourism, which in 2018 contributed 12 per cent to GDP and provided 13 per cent of all jobs, has ground to a virtual halt, as have many other services.

Small and medium-sized companies, which represent more than 70 per cent of employment, well above the EU average, are particularly vulnerable. Micro-companies of fewer than 10 employees, which account for more than 40 per cent of all jobs outside the financial sector, are even more exposed.

Yet, with its limited fiscal room for manoeuvre, Spain has been less generous than other European countries. When Pedro SÃ¡nchez, the country's Socialist prime minister, announced 10 days ago that the government was halting all work deemed non-essential for two weeks, the bill was passed to the private sector. Companies are required to go on paying salaries on the understanding that their employees will make up lost hours before the end of the year.

Spain's â‚¬100bn loan-guarantee scheme for businesses falls far short of the UK's Â£330bn programme, let alone the ""bazooka"" with no upper limit that Germany has put into place.

A comparison by Bruegel, the think-tank, suggested that by the end of March Spain had put in place discretionary fiscal measures and guarantees worth around 12 per cent of GDP, compared to 18 per cent in the UK, 23 per cent in France and closer to 60 per cent in Germany.

""In a crisis like this, the Spanish economy cannot take on more debt; it can't,"" said Mr SÃ¡nchez last month as he called for the EU to underwrite a latter-day Marshall Plan to reconstruct the economy. He added that the last financial crisis also hit southern Europe harder than the north.

Spain only emerged from that crisis after bailing out the banking sector, reducing workers' wages, and shrinking companies' balance sheets. Mr SÃ¡nchez is acutely aware that the experience also finished off his immediate predecessor as Socialist prime minister.

""The ghost of the global financial crisis is haunting Spain's relations with Europe,"" said Ilke Toygur, at the Elcano Royal Institute, a Madrid-based think-tank. ""SÃ¡nchez and his government desperately need more help from the EU for the recovery and reconstruction that the Spanish economy needs -- on which his own political survival depends.""","{'uri':

Yet the ranking also highlights 500 businesses across the continent for whom innovation and creativity have paid off -- attributes that will underpin resilience and enable many of them to thrive once the worst effects of the pandemic are behind them.

The FT list was compiled with Statista, a research company, and ranks entrants from across the Americas by compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue between 2015 and 2018.

The technology sector, led overwhelmingly by the US, accounts for a quarter of the overall list, followed by support services (9 per cent) and financial services (7 per cent). The ranking is not a reflection of the size of each country's economy, but rather a function of the dynamism of a given market and, importantly, the willingness of its companies to be candid with their results. Brazil, for instance, featured fewer companies on the ranking than Colombia. Nearly nine in 10 on the overall list hail from the US and Canada alone.

The top three companies include a developer of augmented reality and video games, a robotics and artificial intelligence company and an advertising business that enables publishers to auction online ad space in real-time. None of these companies -- all from the US -- had a 2015-18 compound annual growth rate below 600 per cent.

The full report featuring case studies and analysis from this year's ranking will be published in print and here on May 12.

So what insights can be gleaned from focusing on businesses that have been growing at hyper speed -- especially when the coronavirus pandemic has just thrown economies across the globe into unprecedented turmoil, and even strong companies fear for their survival?

Readers can use the toggles at the top of the table's columns to filter by country, sector or revenue, helping to sharpen their impression of where high-growth businesses have flourished most. Investors can use the list as they research which companies are likely to prove resilient over the next couple of years.

Switch from CAGR to 2018 revenues, for instance, and household names such a Tesla, Netflix, Uber and PayPal rise to the top of the table. These established businesses are also among a group of just 36 of the overall 500 that are listed on an exchange.

As a sizeable chunk of fast-growing companies tend to be privately held and detailed financial information not made public, a ranking such as this can never claim to be complete. Yet the fact that about 90 per cent of the companies featured here are unlisted -- and that the screening process was rigorous (please refer to the methodology below the table) -- means the ranking offers readers a glimpse into the black box that is private companies.

Scroll below the interactive table for the full methodology.

* Companies marked with an asterisk had less than 12 months of revenue in the 2015 financial year, but still passed $100,000 revenue.

** Companies marked with a double asterisk have been acquired since the end of the relevant timeframe.

The FT Americas' Fastest Growing Companies 2020 is a list of the top 500 companies in the Americas that have achieved the highest growth in revenues between 2015 and 2018.

The ranking was created through a complex procedure. Although the search was very extensive, the ranking does not claim to be complete, as some companies did not want to make their figures public or did not participate for other reasons.

The project was advertised online and in print, allowing all eligible companies to register via the websites created by Statista and the Financial Times. It was additionally promoted through the South American edition of El PaÃ­s. In addition, through research in company databases and other public sources, Statista has identified tens of thousands of companies in the Americas as potential candidates for the FT ranking. These companies were invited to participate in the competition by post, email and telephone.

The application phase ran from October 1 2019 to January 31 2020. The submitted revenue figures had to be certified by the CFO, CEO or a member of the executive committee of the company.

To be included in the list of the Americas' fastest-growing companies, a company had to meet the following criteria:

* Revenue of at least $100,000 generated in 2015 (or currency value equivalent according to the average of the actual fiscal year).

* Revenue of at least $1.5m generated in 2018 (or currency value equivalent according to the average of the actual fiscal year).

* The company is independent (the company is not a subsidiary or branch office of any kind).

* The revenue growth between 2015 and 2018 was primarily organic (ie ""internally"" stimulated)

* The company is headquartered in one of 20 American countries.

Companies from these countries were eligible to participate: Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the US, Uruguay, Venezuela.

The calculation of company growth rates is based on the revenue figures submitted by the companies in the respective national currency. For better comparability in the ranking the revenue figures were converted into US dollars. The average exchange rate for the financial year indicated by the company was used for this purpose.

The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was calculated as follows:

((revenue2018 / revenue2015)^(1/3)) - 1 = CAGR

The absolute growth between 2015 and 2018 was calculated as follows:

(revenue2018 / revenue2015) - 1 = Growth rate

All data reported by the companies was processed and checked by Statista. Missing data entries (employee numbers, address data, etc) were researched in detail. Companies that did not fulfil the criteria for inclusion in the ranking were deleted.

In addition, Statista included some well-known companies noted for their remarkable growth (four in total). The data has been collected via desk research in official sources like publicly available earning presentations, investor relations websites or annual reports.

The minimum CAGR required to be included in the ranking this year was 18.2 per cent.","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri':

However, the likely extent of the economic contraction is being continuously revised, reflecting the difficulties in limiting the spread of the virus and the lack of reliable data as businesses are increasingly unable to complete regular surveys.

The Financial Times has therefore looked at more frequent and alternative economic information to track the depth of the slowdown to date. This includes the drop in electricity consumption, the property market virtually grinding to a halt, consumer spending and the fallout on a jobs market that has been incredibly resilient in the past decade.

Business surveys have shown activity crashing faster in March than during the financial crisis, but many European statistics agencies have warned of reduced accuracy of survey-based indicators.

The Office for National Statistics has published experimental research on the impact of Covid-19 on the economy. However, economists warned that it will be more useful to track the economic recovery than the fallout because of their lack of historical comparison.

Instead, data from the European Network of Transmission System Operators (Entso-e), provide a timely indicator of electricity consumption, a broad measure of economic activity.

According to FT analysis of their data, UK electricity consumption plunged 10 per cent in the last week of March following the introduction of the lockdown compared with the same period last year, despite a lower mean temperature than in March 2019.

UK daily traffic use has also fallen sharply, but this reflects households adopting social distancing measures as well as a reduction in economic activity.

Mobility data based on account locations released by Google show that journeys to workplaces in the UK were 55 per cent lower at the end of March compared with the average of the previous five weeks, reflecting more people working from home and reduced activity.

The Department for Work and Pensions has revealed that nearly 1m people applied for universal credit, the government's main welfare benefit, in the last two weeks of March. But there have been no other official data on the state of the labour market.

However, FT analysis of the government site ""find a job"" revealed that on April 7 there were 20 per cent fewer vacancies than at the end of March, with sales and hospitality jobs down 40 per cent.

The job sites LinkedIn and Indeed reported that by the end of March, hiring and job posting had fallen by double digits.

Wagestream, a fintech platform used by 36,000 workers in the hospitality sector, reported a 97 per cent decline in the number of hours worked in the industry on Sunday, March 29, compared with the first Sunday of the month.

""Despite the hugely welcome wage and income subsidy schemes for furloughed employees and self-employed workers, a huge number of people are still going to lose their jobs and need immediate income support to avoid hardship,"" said Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank.

""Consumer spending is likely to slump by an unprecedented amount over the next few months,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy.

The most obvious impact of the virus on spending is the fall to zero for most discretionary items such as restaurants, bars, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres that have been closed since March 20.

Last month car sales plunged 44 per cent -- a steeper drop than during the financial crisis, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Despite the food hoarding, retail footfall was down 83 per cent on Sunday compared with the same day of the week last year, according to Spring-Board, a retail consultancy.

The collapse in spending on goods and services that are heavily affected by the lockdown, such as transport, restaurants, housing goods, hotels and entertainment, represents a big blow to the economy because those items add up to more than 40 per cent of family spending.

The property market has also come to a sudden stop as new home visits are banned in line with social distancing measures. Property website Zoopla reported a 40 per cent drop in demand at the end of March, defined as browsing on the website followed by inquiry.

""Demand for housing to buy and rent has fallen sharply since the end of the first week in March,"" said Richard Donnell, Zoopla research director. ""It has now started to bottom out at levels more closely associated with the Christmas holiday period.""

As a result of the freeze properties are not being added to the market, with new listings down to less than half the level at the start of March.

Lucy Pendleton, founder-director of independent estate agent James Pendleton, reported a 70 per cent fall in offers at the end of March and an even steeper drop in sales agreed. ""We have been forced to furlough more than half of our staff,"" she said.

With entire swaths of the economy having shut down ""traditional forecasting methods become irrelevant"", warned Chiara Zangarelli, economist at investment bank Nomura.

Yet, many leading forecasters expect an economic contraction greater than 6 per cent this year, compared with 4.2 per cent in 2009, making the coronavirus crisis possibly a deeper contraction than during the Great Depression.

Robert Wood, economist at Bank of America, has revised down his UK growth forecast for 2020 to a 7.4 per cent contraction because he calculated that UK stimulus measures were proving ""less effective than we [previously] assumed"". That would be one of the largest since 1900.

Michelle Girard, economist at NatWest, said that while there was huge uncertainty about the precise magnitude of the contraction in gross domestic product in the second quarter, ""there is little doubt that it will be off the scale"".","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007â€“2008', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Financial crisis of 2007â€“2008'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Electricity'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United Kingdom'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Pandemic'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Consumer spending'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Demand'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Virus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Economy of the United Kingdom'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Recession'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Social distancing'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Credit', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Universal Credit'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Hospitality'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Experiment'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Financial Times'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Department for Work and Pensions'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Economist'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Office for National Statistics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Labour economics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Welfare'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Temperature'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Google'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'LinkedIn'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Restaurant'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZPG_Ltd', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'ZPG Ltd'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Motor_Manufacturers_and_Traders', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Economics', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Capital Economics'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Investment banking'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America', 'type': 'org', 'score': 1, 'label': {'eng': 'Bank of America'}}]","[{'uri': 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic', 'label': 'dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic', 'wgt': 15}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics', 'label': 'dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics', 'wgt': 19}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting', 'wgt': 14}, {'uri': 'dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services', 'label': 'dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services', 'wgt': 16}, {'uri': 'news/Business', 'label': 'news/Business', 'wgt': 99}]",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F4750aac8-d400-4a45-b57c-4f89d7153fae.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900,,,{'facebook': 368},-0.3098039215686275,368,76

In the coronavirus crisis, his wish may have come true. Academic economists on both sides of the Atlantic are virtually unanimous in their support of lockdown measures taken by governments to stop the virus from spreading, despite the huge economic costs of doing so.

Over the last week, the scale of those costs has become apparent. In many countries jobs are being lost at a pace not seen since the 1930s. Ten million Americans have applied for unemployment insurance and 1m Britons have registered for universal credit in the last two weeks.

Purchasing managers' indices in big European economies have recorded their steepest declines on record. Most analysts now expect a bigger and faster contraction in output across the global economy than during the global financial crisis.

Some ask whether the cure might be worse than the disease. But the reply from economists is a resounding ""no"".

""In times of great uncertainty, most economists think the government should intervene,"" said Rachel Griffith, president of the UK's Royal Economic Society and professor of economics at the University of Manchester.

Surveys show a striking degree of consensus among top economists in favour of the lockdowns.

The IGM Economic Experts Panel's latest survey of top US macroeconomists asked for their view of the statement ""Abandoning severe lockdowns at a time when the likelihood of a resurgence in infections remains high will lead to greater total economic damage than sustaining the lockdowns to eliminate the resurgence risk"". Eighty per cent of the panel agreed, the rest were uncertain or did not respond. Not a single expert disagreed.

In Europe, 65 per cent of respondents agreed that ""severe lockdowns -- including closing non-essential businesses and strict limitations on people's movement -- are likely to be better for the economy in the medium term than less aggressive measures"". Only 4 per cent disagreed.

""Clearly there is a cost"" to the lockdowns, said Ms Griffith, ""but what is the counterfactual? The cost of not containing the virus would be greater -- even economically."" Not only was saving lives inherently valuable, but fear of contagion would cause economic disruption even in the absence of government action, she explained.

While there was ""exponential infection growth .â€‰.â€‰. I am not surprised that there is a consensus on the need for lockdown"", said Beatrice Weder di Mauro, president of the Centre for Economic Policy Research. ""The disagreements will be on how long and how to get out of it.""

For the moment, economists are deferring to medical and epidemiological experts on when the contagion could be said to be under control. ""We should lift the restrictions the minute we can,"" said Ms Griffith, ""once we have testing and measures for containing the virus .â€‰.â€‰. for now it is a medical not an economic issue.""

In the meantime, many governments are asking economists to keep a close eye on the costs of the lockdown and how best to mitigate them without interfering with the desired epidemiological effects. ""There are lots of micro issues"" on which economists can help, said Ms Griffith, ""but broadly the government should do what it is doing.""

A more significant role for economists, she suggested, lay in thinking about what to do in the longer term. ""The biggest questions are intergenerational issues"" such as ""what will happen to those who receive less schooling"" as a result of the lockdowns. There was already a ""torrent of research"" taking place, she said.

""How do we rebuild the economy and who do we focus on?"" These, Ms Griffith said, were the sort of questions economists would be exploring -- ""starting in six months and going on for the next 20 years"".","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Lockdown'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Griffith', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Rachel Griffith'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman', 'type': 'person', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Harry S.

In his annual letter to shareholders, Mr Dimon said JPMorgan was ""not immune"" to the coronavirus crisis and is exposing itself to ""billions of dollars of additional credit losses"" as it lends to businesses and individuals in need.

The bank's board -- which continued to approve shareholder payouts throughout the 2007/8 financial crisis and its aftermath -- would ""likely consider suspending the dividend"" in an ""extremely adverse scenario"", where the US economy contracts by 35 per cent in the second quarter and unemployment rises to 14 per cent, Mr Dimon told investors.

""This scenario is quite severe and, we hope, unlikely,"" he added.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs last week said the US economy could shrink 34 per cent in the second quarter, while analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated it could contract by 38 per cent. Official figures show that US unemployment rose to 4.4 per cent in March, up from a 50-year low of 3.5 per cent in February.

Mr Dimon also cautioned that it ""should be expected that our earnings will be down meaningfully in 2020"", following JPMorgan's record profits last year.

While stopping short of suspending its dividend for now, the tone from the chief of America's most profitable bank is at odds with his US counterparts, who last week offered a staunch defence of their plans to continue making payouts.

Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon last week told CNBC that dividends made up a much smaller part of capital return for American banks than for their European peers, who have been ordered by regulators to halt payments. ""It's my expectation we'll pay our dividend return,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman told CNBC that suspending dividends would be a ""very poor thing to do"" and would be ""destabilising"", while Citigroup boss Mike Corbat told the same channelthe bank's dividend was ""sound and we intend to keep paying it"".

The top eight US banks have already voluntarily suspended their share buyback programmes, which account for more than two-thirds of their shareholder payouts.

Mr Dimon, who returned to work last week after life-saving heart surgery on March 5, also used the missive to take aim at a familiar target for him: post-crisis regulation.

""We are now seeing the impact of poorly co-ordinated, poorly calibrated and poorly organised rulemaking,"" he said. ""After the crisis subsides (and it will), our country should thoroughly review all aspects of our preparedness and response.""

He said the Federal Reserve could improve the flow of capital to the real economy by making ""changes to capital and liquidity requirements"", expanding its balance sheet and offering additional lending facilities. ""These actions would bolster the US economy with no impact on safety, soundness or regulatory oversight.""

JPMorgan has made $650m of new loans to small businesses, and approved more than $25bn of new credit extensions in March alone, according to Mr Dimon. The bank also loaned $1.9bn to hospitals and healthcare companies in March, as well as $360m to non-profit organisations and $240m to state and local governments. It is planning to lend an additional $150bn to clients.

Mr Dimon added: ""Recognising the extraordinary extension of new creditâ€‰.â€‰.â€‰.â€‰and knowing there will be a major recession means that we are exposing ourselves to billions of dollars of additional credit losses as we help both consumers and business customers through these difficult times.""","{'uri': 'ft.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Financial Times'}",[],"[{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Coronavirus'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon', 'type': 'person', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Jamie Dimon'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Shareholder'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase', 'type': 'org', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'JPMorgan Chase'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'Dividend'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States', 'type': 'loc', 'score': 5, 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}, 'location': {'type': 'country', 'label': {'eng': 'United States'}}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Economy of the United States'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Unemployment'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs', 'type': 'org', 'score': 4, 'label': {'eng': 'Goldman Sachs'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007â€“2008', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Financial crisis of 2007â€“2008'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Wall Street'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'CNBC'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession', 'type': 'wiki', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Recession'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley', 'type': 'org', 'score': 3, 'label': {'eng': 'Morgan Stanley'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve', 'type': 'org', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'Federal Reserve'}}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Gorman', 'type': 'person', 'score': 2, 'label': {'eng': 'James P.
