Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\\n\\nA longtime proponent, Fauci has been on a mission of sorts, making his case in another interview this week with Sinclair Broadcast Group, saying society should \"just forget about shaking hands. We don\\'t need to shake hands.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got to break that custom,\" he argued.\\n\\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\\n\\nWhen asked to clarify his controversial stance Thursday morning, Fauci said he doesn\\'t expect his suggestion will stick but that he can always hope.\\n\\n\"In a perfect world, when you\\'re dealing with the potential for this terrible ordeal that we\\'re going through now, knowing that hands and hands to face do it (spread infection), that would be something that I think would hopefully be attainable -- but I don\\'t think it will be,\" Fauci said.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands Richard Ashworth, president of Walgreens, during a news conference about the coronavirus in the Rose Garden at the White House, March 13, 2020, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP, FILE\\n\\n\"I mean, I said that, you know, somewhat serious and somewhat realizing that that likely will never happen,\" Fauci admitted.\\n\\nThe director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases also stressed that Americans should proceed with caution once the country does start loosening lockdown and social distancing restrictions.\\n\\n\"When you gradually come back, you don\\'t jump into it with both feet,\" Fauci explained. \"You say, what are the things you could still do and still approach normal? One of them is absolute compulsive hand-washing. The other is you don\\'t ever shake anybody\\'s hands.\"\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t like a light switch on and off,\" he added. \"It\\'s a gradual pulling back on certain of the restrictions and to try and get society a bit back to normal.\"\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, addresses the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington, April 7, 2020. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\\n\\nFauci has repeatedly cautioned that the virus determines the timeline but said that he hopes the country can \"start approaching some degree of normality\" at the end of April.\\n\\nAnd if he had his way, that return to normalcy would not include -- the handshake.\\n\\nHis view might already have made an impact on President Donald Trump, a self-professed germaphobe since before the pandemic, who suggested last month that \"maybe people aren\\'t going to be shaking hands anymore\" even after the coronavirus outbreak is contained.\\n\\n\"Tony had mentioned to me, Tony Fauci, the other day -- I don\\'t think he would be too upset with the concept of not shaking hands,\" the president said at a White House task force briefing. \"He was saying that the flu would cut down, the regular flu would be cut down by quite a bit if we didn\\'t do that, if we didn\\'t shake hands.\"\\n\\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, listens as President Donald Trump addresses the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington, April 8, 2020. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\\n\\nAmid the ongoing pandemic, people around the world have replaced handshakes with elbow bumps, head nods, peace signs and foot taps -- or avoided contact with others entirely -- in an effort to slow the spread.\\n\\n\"What I really wanted to tell people,\" Fauci added Thursday, \"is that when you\\'re talking about getting back to normal, we know now that we can get hit by a catastrophic outbreak.\"\\n\\n\"It can happen again, so we really need to be prepared to respond in a much more rigorous way.\"\\n\\nWhat to know about coronavirus:\\n\\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: coronavirus explained\\n\\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: coronavirus symptoms\\n\\nTracking the spread in the US and Worldwide: coronavirus map', 'Coronavirus shuts down major cities, Trump asks Americans to avoid groups over 10 people A nationwide quarantine is not being considered \"at this point.\"\\n\\nMajor cities are shutting down restaurants, bars, gyms and schools to try to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has killed at least 85 people in the United States.\\n\\nThere are at least 4,661 confirmed cases in the country.

Based on the experience of other countries, the state of Washington, and modeling data, the sooner we begin social distancing measures on a large enough scale, the more quickly we can slow transmission of the virus, which translates into less people requiring hospitalization at the same time and more lives saved.\"\\n\\nMajor cities including Washington, D.C., and Houston rolled out similar restrictions earlier Monday. The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut also announced that they would abide by the same rules for closures.\\n\\nThe three states agreed to close gyms, movie theaters and casinos as of 8 p.m. Monday, with all restaurants and bars restricted to takeout and delivery only.\\n\\n7:30 p.m.: Thousands of McDonald\\'s expected to close dining areas\\n\\nMcDonald\\'s officials said they plan to close the dining rooms in all company-owned U.S. locations at the close of business on Monday, and they have asked local franchise owners to do the same.\\n\\n\"To align with increasing regulations throughout the country, effective at the close of business today, McDonald’s USA company-owned restaurants will close seating areas, including the use of self-service beverage bars and kiosks, and shift our focus to serving customers through Drive-Thru, walk-in take-out and McDelivery,\\'\\' the company said in a statement Monday night.\\n\\nThe fast-food giant will also close all of its play places after Monday.\\n\\nMcDonald’s, which owns about 5 percent of its nearly 14,000 U.S. restaurants, said franchise owners are \"strongly encouraged to adopt similar operations procedures.\"\\n\\n\"Franchisees are strongly encouraged to adopt similar operations procedures while keeping the needs of their people and communities at the center of their decisions,\" the statement said. \"This guidance is supported by franchisee leadership and is expected to be adopted by the majority of franchisees.\"\\n\\nStarbucks, Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell are among the chains that are also reducing or eliminating on-site dining during the COVID-19 outbreak.\\n\\n6:15 p.m.: Justice Department cracking down on COVID-19 scams\\n\\nThe attorney general is directing states to prioritize the prosecution of scammers, fraudsters and cybercriminals looking to exploit the COVID-19 crisis.\\n\\n\"The pandemic is dangerous enough without wrongdoers seeking to profit from public panic and this sort of conduct cannot be tolerated,\" U.S. Attorney General William Barr wrote in a memo sent to U.S. attorneys offices around the country Monday evening. \"Every U.S. attorney\\'s office is thus hereby directed to prioritize the detection, investigation, and prosecution of all criminal conduct related to the current pandemic.\"\\n\\nThe memo also asks U.S. attorneys to work with the chief judges in their districts \"to ensure that every appropriate precaution is taken to protect the health of those who practice in or are called before our courts.\"\\n\\n\"It is vital that we work together to safeguard our justice system and thus the safety and security of our nation,\" Barr said.\\n\\nAn aerial view shows an area of South Beach that the city closed in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus on March 16, 2020 in Miami Beach, Fla.

The ban does not apply to grocery stores and pharmacies.\\n\\nWashington state has been especially hard-hit by the coronavirus with at least 42 fatalities.\\n\\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti also took action.

Sean Casten, D-Ill., tweeted this past week after Trump delivered a prime-time national address that erroneously described several steps he\\'s taking to try containing the virus. “They elected him. They coddled him. They cowered before him.”\\n\\nDemocrats\\' first ads on the theme have only started trickling out. Yet they point to GOP soft spots Democrats detect and the emotional appeals they\\'ll make.\\n\\nBefore quitting the Democratic presidential race this month, Mike Bloomberg ran two ads that implicitly challenged Trump\\'s ability to manage the crisis by citing Bloomberg\\'s efforts as New York City mayor right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. “Trust is essential,\" Bloomberg said.\\n\\nThe Democratic-backed group Protect Our Care began airing a spot this week in Montana asserting that the state\\'s GOP senator, Steve Daines, “doesn\\'t worry\" about families\\' health concerns including coronavirus. It depicts a concerned mom hovering over her daughter, who lies bedridden in a hospital.\\n\\nDaines, who faces a competitive reelection race this November, has favored repealing former President Barack Obama\\'s health care law, though there\\'s no proof that Daines is unconcerned about coronavirus. Jesse Hunt, spokesman for the Senate GOP\\'s campaign committee, said Democrats are running “disgusting attack ads that politicize a disease that knows no party.”\\n\\nShort of campaign ads, both sides have used press releases and emails to dual over the virus.\\n\\nChristy Smith, a Democrat battling for an open House seat from Los Angeles, emailed supporters accusing Republicans of “legislative malpractice” for blocking a Democratic bill addressing the problem.\\n\\nAnd an email from the Great America PAC, a group that supports Trump, says while Trump has been “working around the clock to keep Americans safe and healthy,\" he\\'s been blamed by “the Left and Fake News media” for the outbreak.\\n\\nSuch emails are often used to generate lists of potential voters, volunteers and donors. Trump has repeatedly referred to criticisms of his administration\\'s coronavirus performance as a “hoax.\"\\n\\nRepublicans say there is still time for Trump to tame the coronavirus and the economy and consign them to background noise before Election Day.\\n\\n“If we do this right, in the mid-summer the economy and stocks will come roaring back,” said Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio.\\n\\nA quick turnabout will be crucial for Trump, whose presidency has featured frequent high-profile clashes that often drown each other out. That includes his House impeachment and his acquittal just five weeks ago by the Senate, which have already been overshadowed by the latest crisis.\\n\\nAbove all issues, a feeble economy can spell an incumbent president\\'s downfall, and things currently look grim. Plummeting financial markets, withering 401(k) accounts, growing layoffs, slowed consumer spending and travel and the shutdown of sports leagues and entertainment venues are hardly the stuff that lures voters.\\n\\nTrump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency Friday, saying that would provide $50 billion to state and local governments for the outbreak. The Dow Jones average rose over 1,900 points Friday but was still in bear market territory, down over 20 percent from its all-time high last month.\\n\\nTrump is also poised to sign a House-passed coronavirus relief package.\\n\\nBut in an example of his tendency to downplay the virus and his defensiveness about the administration\\'s slow-footed reaction to it, he said, “I don\\'t take responsibility at all\" for the plodding roll-out of testing in the U.S.\\n\\nThat left the wounded economy and the virus irresistible targets for Democrats, who are tying them to criticism of Trump as incompetent.\\n\\n“You wouldn\\'t have had a massive fluctuation in the stock market this week if he wasn\\'t really disturbing the confidence of investors,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., a former Democratic Party chairwoman. She said Trump\\'s “fly by the seat of his pants, cover his own tuchus approach does not inspire confidence.”\\n\\n“President Trump has taken kind of malicious pride in asserting that he alone can make things happen,” said Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt. \"And he\\'s run into his match with a coronavirus that simply doesn\\'t respond to his tweets and insults.”\\n\\nDemocratic presidential candidates have struck similar themes.\\n\\nJoe Biden said “a pervasive lack of trust in this president” had hindered the response to the virus, compounded by Trump\\'s leaving the country “woefully unprepared.” The former vice president\\'s chief rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, said the administration\\'s “incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people.”\\n\\nStill, Republicans are watching to see if Democrats overstep.\\n\\nThe risk for Democrats is if they “look like they are cheering for a worsening of a very serious situation,” said Ayres, the GOP pollster.\\n\\n———\\n\\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Rep.

City officials in Nome followed most other Alaska cities in closing or limiting access to most public buildings in wake of the state’s first positive test, that of a man from outside the United States. The man was tested Thursday at an Anchorage hospital after earlier arriving in the city on a private cargo plane.\\n\\n“The Iditarod fully appreciates and is humbled by the passion and social energy of the Iditarod nation; however, we are asking you to not make any nonessential travel to the Nome finish, in particular, those who are traveling from outside of Alaska,” according to a statement from the Iditarod.\\n\\nRace officials are also paring down their own staff to only essential personnel needed in Nome for the finish. That list is limited to veterinarians, necessary dog handlers and staff needed for communications and to coordinate logistics.\\n\\nThe Iditarod had previously postponed post-race events in Nome, including the musher’s banquet and an annual meet-and-greet with mushers.\\n\\nRace Marshal Mark Nordman told the Anchorage Daily News that he didn’t know how a race like the Iditarod could be canceled, but said continuing the race was being done under the guidance of state officials.\\n\\n“If the state of Alaska said the race must stop, we’d stop,\" Nordman told the newspaper. \"We have not heard that.”\\n\\nThe vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. More than 80,000 people in China have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. More than 65,000 have recovered.\\n\\nIditarod officials were also scrambling to move checkpoints away from villages where mushers stop en route to Nome. Many times village schools are used as checkpoints or a place to allow a musher to rest but the Bering Strait School District, which includes many communities that serve as checkpoints, closed facilities and said it would not host Iditarod activities.\\n\\nJessie Royer of Fairbanks was in the race\\'s lead Saturday. She was the first musher to reach the checkpoint in Kaltag, and picked up 25 pounds of fresh salmon filets and $2,000 for the feat. Royer, an Idaho native who was raised in Montana, is vying to become the first woman in 30 years to win the Iditarod. The last woman to win the race was the late Susan Butcher, who won her fourth Iditarod in 1990.\\n\\nRoyer earlier Saturday was also the first at the checkpoint in Nulato. The checkpoint in this village of about 360 and originally founded in 1838 as a Russian trading post is normally the community hall, and the school is also widely used.\\n\\n“Because the school in Nulato was not available, the Iditarod changed its checkpoint location to on the Yukon River,” Nordman said in a statement. “All supplies are in place and the checkpoint is fully manned.”\\n\\nAnother community closer to Nome is also off limits this year because of concerns over the virus. The Iditarod, in consultation with community leaders in Shaktoolik, decided to bypass the community and set up the checkpoint outside town.\\n\\nFood that mushers have flown to the checkpoint will be moved to the new location, along with straw for dogs to bed down. Provisions are being made to allow the teams to get a hot meal before getting back on the trail.\\n\\nThe race started Sunday in Willow for 57 mushers, down to 53 after four withdrew, including Nils Hahn and Alan Eischens on Friday morning. The winner of the nearly 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) race across Alaska is expected in the town of Nome, on the Bering Sea, sometime next week.', 'Iran rejects coronavirus aid amid conspiracy theories and sanctions Iran has been hard hit with a death toll of at least 1,934.\\n\\nIran rejected coronavirus aid provided by Doctors Without Borders, an international medical humanitarian organization, which had sent a team of medical staff and a field hospital to Iran.\\n\\n\"Since the national mobilization for confronting corona is ongoing, and the medical capabilities of Iranian Armed Forces are entirely at its service, Iran does not need hospitals established by foreigners and such presence is irrelevant,\" an adviser to Iran’s health minister, Alireza Vahhabzadeh, tweeted on Monday.\\n\\nThe Islamic Republic is the hardest hit country in the region with a death toll of at least 1,934 and 24,811 officially confirmed infection cases, the spokesman of the health ministry, Kianoush Jahanpour said on Tuesday, Iranian Students’ News Agency reported.\\n\\nIranian fire department staffs disinfect the public places against coronavirus at night using machinery and mobile pumps, March 16, 2020, in Tehran, Iran.

So they began volunteering at Loyola’s call center and answering questions based on constantly changing CDC information and Loyola medical center’s instructions.\\n\\n\"We had young and old people crying just out of fear on the phone,\" said Eda Akyar, a third-year medical student at Stritch School of Medicine and one of the hotline’s student leaders. \"Having someone to speak to at Loyola Medical Center really helped calm some people down and put into perspective the things you need to do to keep yourself healthy in this very stressful time.\"\\n\\nWhat to know about coronavirus:\\n\\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: Coronavirus explained\\n\\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: Coronavirus symptoms\\n\\nTracking the spread in the U.S. and worldwide: Coronavirus map\\n\\nOne Loyola medical student volunteering on the hotline, Richie Green, a fourth year Stritch student, says one of the calls that stood out came from a woman who had recently been hospitalized because of a chronic condition that put her at higher risk for COVID-19.\\n\\nShe called Loyola’s hotline seeking a test, and Green acted as a \"goalkeeper,\" Akyar described, directing the caller to a nurse who ultimately determined she was eligible. The woman’s next step would be to get a COVID-19 test at a Loyola facility prepared to receive such patients, Akyar said, and wait for her results. In this way, the hotline is attempting to help cut down on the number of people unnecessarily physically waiting in the hospital for testing information, Akyar added.\\n\\nPart of leadership from Loyola University’s medical students who helped staff the hospital’s hotline stand on-call in the center: Left to right: Giselle Elisabeth Karine Malina, Herbert Parker Strider and Eda Akyar.

I validated her fears because it is a scary thing.\"\\n\\nAfter reassuring the caller, Greens says she responded by saying, \"You know, my mother in heaven must have connected me with you today.\"\\n\\n\"[It] amazed me and kind of made me laugh because I did not feel like I did very much except to educate her on what I knew about the disease ... and listen to her,\" Green said. \"It made a difference.\"\\n\\nFor the Loyola medical students, staffing the hotline was a way to contribute to the health care system, which is each of their ultimate life goals.\\n\\nBrianna Nicole Martinez, Loyola University third year medical student, part of student hotline leadership volunteers to answer patient questions about COVID-19.

Company founders Mei Mei Hu and her husband, Lou Reese, are part-time residents of Telluride. About 6,000 people were tested during the first round, according to the county.\\n\\nOfficials said the goal with widespread testing is to learn whether a person\\'s blood showed signs of COVID-19 exposure. That information might help officials decide if widespread quarantines and stay-at-home orders should stay in place, or could be strategically lifted.\\n\\nEarlier this week the county said the second round of tests had been \"delayed indefinitely\" because United Biomedical had been compromised by staffing shortages and had processed only about 1,600 of 6,000 tests.\\n\\nUnited Biomedical is now working with San Miguel County, which includes the famous Rocky Mountain ski destination Telluride, to test all 8,000 residents for COVID-19 antibodies.

The indication that the lab was compromised was unintentionally misleading and the County apologizes for any confusion it created,” county officials said in a press release. “San Miguel County remains confident in the quality of test results from UBI. As UBI continues to work diligently to supply results, the County is standing by to resume testing when appropriate.”\\n\\nThe county\\'s press release included a statement from Hu, United Biomedical’s CEO, saying they looked forward to continuing testing.\\n\\n“Like all labs, ours has experienced increased demand in the midst of an unprecedented global public health crisis. We have delivered almost 2,000 initial results from San Miguel County and anticipate continuing to deliver expanded results as samples are continuing to arrive at our lab. We look forward to the second round of testing with our partners in San Miguel County,” Hu said in the release.\\n\\nA United Biomedical representative told ABC News their lab is up and running and was never compromised, but is adjusting to a new normal brought on by the burdens of the coronavirus pandemic, which caused a temporary decrease in staff as employees adjusted to school closures and working from home.\\n\\nThe company said it has now hired additional staff for the lab, which it said can process 100 samples every two to three hours.\\n\\nCounty officials did not specify when the second round of antibody testing would begin.', 'Transcript for Coronavirus daily update: April 01, 2020\\n\\nI.

Symptoms range from mild in most cases to severe, requiring hospitalization and critical care.\\n\\nSome countries have been more aggressive than others in testing, like South Korea, which deployed tens of thousands of tests early on in the outbreak, compared to the United States, which initially only tested those with travel contacts.\\n\\nThe number of people tested in the U.S. has grown since then, but experts say the government should be testing more. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, called the testing system that was in place \"a failing.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s what you need to know about testing:\\n\\nDo I need a test?\\n\\nIt depends.\\n\\nDespite President Trump saying last week that \"anyone who wants a test can get a test,\" officials say that getting everyone tested is a long-term goal. Currently, testing is limited and should be for those who really need it, public health officials told ABC News.\\n\\nAs of March 13, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) labs have tested some 3,900 specimens of the virus, while U.S. public health labs have tested over 12,000 specimens. More than 81 public health labs are online in all 50 states and are conducting testing, according to the CDC, with testing results still pending.\\n\\nA medical technologist tests a respiratory panel at Northwell Health Labs, where the same test will be used on the COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, after being authorized to begin semi-automated testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Lake Success, N.Y., March 11, 2020. Shannon Stapleton/Reuters, FILE\\n\\nGenerally, the CDC says the decision should be left up to your doctor.\\n\\n\"Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested,\" according to the CDC.\\n\\nThose who should receive priority testing include: hospitalized patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19; individuals over 65 who show symptoms; those with underlying health conditions; and health personnel who had contact with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient, the CDC said in a March 8 release.\\n\\nThe CDC said doctors should encourage their patients \"to stay home and contact their healthcare provider by phone for guidance about clinical management.\"\\n\\n\"Patients who have severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, should seek care immediately. Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness,\" the CDC said.\\n\\nPublic health officials told ABC News that the push for testing has become a distraction and likened it to frenzy-buying of medical masks, tying up valuable resources.\\n\\nWhy test?\\n\\nMany COVID-19 symptoms are similar to the common cold and influenza, but only testing can confirm an infection. This is different, for instance, from China, which for a period of time included clinical diagnoses in its count in addition to lab-confirmed tests. Scientists told ABC News that changing that methodology could complicate tracking the disease.\\n\\nMedical personnel secure a sample from a person at a drive-thru Coronavirus COVID-19 testing station at a Kaiser Permanente facility, March 12, 2020 in San Francisco. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images, FILE\\n\\nPublic health officials told ABC News that testing is necessary mainly to track the spread of disease and ensure proper treatment and isolation for those infected, especially since COVID-19 is an influenza-like illness.\\n\\nHow does it work?\\n\\nOn Friday, the White House announced a new testing protocol where prospective patients are directed to a screening website. If they have symptoms, they will be directed to a drive-thru testing site, like those in Denver and elsewhere. Those tests will be sent to labs for analysis, said Dr. Debbie Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator.\\n\\nBut public health officials told ABC News that it is not like taking a pregnancy test or other common medical tests. Instead, it is more like the test for Ebola, they said, providing a set of data as opposed to a yes or no answer.\\n\\nUnder the current protocol, according to officials, test administered by hospitals or clinics typically involve:\\n\\n-Two sets of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\\n\\n-20 to 25 minutes to put on and take off PPE.\\n\\n-Transporting the sample to the lab -- a process called real-time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)\\n\\n-A certified epidemiologist confirms every positive test.\\n\\n-Results are entered into the system.\\n\\nAny test conducted on someone under quarantine requires even more resources and protection, the officials told ABC News.\\n\\nUnder the new protocol, using the drive-thru sites, \"the goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,\" President Trump said on March 13. The test uses a nasal swab, Birx said.\\n\\nHow long will the results take?\\n\\nIt depends. Results had been taking a few days, but the new testing procedure would take 24 hours from start to finish, Birx said.\\n\\nCan I test negative and later test positive?\\n\\nAccording to the CDC, yes.\\n\\nUnder the CDC-developed test, a negative result means the virus was not detected in the patient\\'s sample, which is possible in the early stages of infection.\\n\\n\"For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness,\" the CDC said.\\n\\nWhat if I test positive?\\n\\nAs ABC News\\' chief medical correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton and other medical experts have pointed out, there is no treatment for this virus.\\n\\nAll medical professionals can do for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is keep their body healthy to allow it to fight off the virus. Ventilators are used to assist in breathing in some cases and antibiotics are used to fight off secondary infections a patient may develop.\\n\\nExperts also say it will take a year to 18 months to develop a vaccine because testing it in real-world environments and ensuring it works is time-consuming.\\n\\nWhat are the new tests coming?\\n\\nThree labs, Everlywell, MicroGenDX and Nurx -- have made it possible to test for COVID-19 right from your living room.\\n\\nHome kits allow patients to swab at home, send samples to a central lab and have results within days. However, swabs are in short supply, so many of these companies are expecting supply chain problems and are actively looking for workarounds.\\n\\nAll the at-home testing kits have to get shipped to a lab for results. The Everlywell and Nurx tests get results between 48 hours or \"within days\" while MicroGenDX\\'s COVID-19 Rapid PCR Test has a 24-hour turnaround from time of receipt.\\n\\nMicroGenDX will have the capacity to process over 8,000 samples per day beginning April 1 or sooner.\\n\\nTraditional testing labs such as Hologic, LabCorp and Abbott -- are working to speed up their existing testing capacity.\\n\\nHologic has FDA approval to provide results for coronavirus tests in less than three hours and to process up to 1,150 tests in a 24-hour period.\\n\\nLabCorp expects to perform 10,000 tests every day and by the end of the month conduct 20,000 per day.\\n\\nAbbott is scaling up production at its U.S. manufacturing location to reach up to one million tests per week by end of March. Their m2000 RealTime testing system is currently available in hospitals and molecular laboratories and ships 150,000 laboratory tests immediately.\\n\\nWhat to know about Coronavirus:\\n\\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: Coronavirus explained\\n\\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: Coronavirus symptoms\\n\\nTracking the spread in the US and Worldwide: Coronavirus map\\n\\nAdditional reporting from ABC News\\' Erin Schumaker and Christina Carrega', 'Fact Check: Trump’s coronavirus response plagued with misstatements Some of the things the White House said this week that simply are not true.\\n\\nThis past week marked a turning point for the president, who seems to have finally come to grips with the scale and scope of the global pandemic surrounding novel coronavirus. But unfortunately, his misleading and false statements are spreading this week apace with with the virus itself.\\n\\nCoverage of his hastily arranged Oval Office address to the nation on Wednesday night immediately captured a number of untrue statements. While the president\\'s mission was to reassure a nation reeling from fear and uncertainty, his message was muddled in confusing and false statements. The next day the markets responded in kind. Responding to the president and to announcements that some large corporations would halt business as usual, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted by 10 percent -- the biggest drop since 1987.\\n\\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 12, 2020, in New York. Jeenah Moon/Getty Images\\n\\nHere are just some of the things the White House said this week that simply are not true. Welcome back to Fact Check Friday.\\n\\nOval correction\\n\\nIt\\'s one thing when you send out a tweet to correct another tweet. It\\'s entirely different when you send out a tweet to correct errors in a prime-time presidential address to the nation amidst a public health emergency with life and death consequences. But that\\'s what the president had to do Wednesday night.\\n\\nAnd if he were being completely honest he would have sent a few more corrections.\\n\\nHis biggest error was to falsely declare that the European travel ban would also \"apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval.\" He later corrected that in a tweet, noting \"trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe,\" offering no explanation for the initial error.\\n\\nBut he never corrected his false claim that health insurers have agreed to waive co-payments for coronavirus treatments. In fact, as the Vice President had already announced earlier in the week that insurance companies agreed to waive co-pays for testing, not treatment.\\n\\n\\'Going Smooth\\'\\n\\nThursday really highlighted the conflicting narrative between the president and pretty much everyone else on COVID-19 testing. On the same day the president claimed \"testing has been going very smooth,\" his top public health official called the national response \"a failing.\" Even loyal Republicans lawmakers told ABC News the president\\'s messaging is off.\\n\\nThe president said at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta this week \"anyone who wants a test can get a test.\" He said it repeatedly. \"Anybody right now and yesterday anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. The tests are there. The tests are beautiful. Anyone who wants a test can get a test.\"\\n\\nBut it\\'s simply not true. Not only are there countless examples of Americans who want tests and can\\'t get them, but as CDC Director Robert Redfield pointed out in testimony to Congress this week, there are 350 million Americans and only about 4 million tests in the pipeline. The math doesn\\'t add up.\\n\\nThe president also claimed Thursday at the White House \"we’re very much ahead of everything.\"\\n\\nHealthcare workers from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment test people for COVID-19 at the state\\'s first drive-up testing center on March 12, 2020, in Denver. Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images\\n\\nAccording to ABC News estimates as of Wednesday night public labs in the U.S. had conducted only around 10,000 tests. By comparison, South Korea is conducting 10,000 tests a day. The American numbers are expected to rise sharply, but the numbers clearly show they\\'re behind.\\n\\nThe president also claimed on Thursday that Americans returning from Europe are being tested at the airport.\\n\\n\"But we have them very heavily tested,\" Trump said. \"If an American is coming back, or anybody is coming back, we are testing. We have a tremendous testing set up where people coming in have to be tested,\" Trump said. \"Frankly... we are not putting them on planes if they’re, if it shows positive.\"\\n\\nPassengers, including Aleksandra, left, from Poland and Sophia, center, from Germany, who said they will be working as au pairs in New York and booked their flights yesterday following Trump\\'s announcement, wait to board the last direct United Airlines flight from Berlin to New York at Tegel Airport, in Berlin, March 13, 2020. The Trump administration is temporarily banning all non-U.S. citizens from flying from continental Europe to the United States in an effort to slow the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\\n\\nThat is also false. Not only has ABC spoken to multiple people who returned from Europe on Thursday who were NOT tested, it\\'s also unclear the government is even preparing to do the testing.\\n\\nCustoms and Border Protection tells ABC News that starting at 11:59 p.m. Friday all arriving passengers who\\'ve been to the restricted European countries within 14 days -- and are exempt from the outright ban on travel -- will be referred to the CDC for \"advanced health screenings.\" But they make no mention of tests. And the CDC has not responded to our questions about whether or not \"advanced health screening\" equates to a test.\\n\\nEurope\\'s failures\\n\\nThe point of the president\\'s Oval Office address was to announce that he\\'d banned incoming travel from much of Europe. But even that message was riddled with inaccuracies and ambiguity.\\n\\n\"We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people,\" the president declared. Yet the Europeans said they were completely caught off guard by the announcement. In a statement the morning after Trump\\'s remarks the EU said \"the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.\"\\n\\nDescribing it as a \"foreign\" virus the president broadly blamed the European Union for taking the same precautions he did and restrict travel from China and other hot spots. \"As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe,\" Trump said.\\n\\nTune into ABC News Live at noon ET every weekday for the latest news, context and analysis on the novel coronavirus, with the full ABC News team where we will try to answer your questions about the virus.\\n\\nWhile the president might be speaking in broad terms, Italy, the country hit hardest by the coronavirus in Europe, imposed a ban on flights to and from China, including Hong Kong and Macao, and Taiwan, on January 31st -- three days before the U.S. imposed a similar ban on flights to and from China. However, the U.S. ban did not include Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao.\\n\\nPerhaps the most critical line of his speech was also inaccurate. \"To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,\" Trump said.\\n\\nHe mentioned that the United Kindgom was exempt, but didn\\'t mention a whole host of European countries also exempt, including: Ireland, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus.\\n\\nOn Friday afternoon while he was declaring a national emergency from the Rose Garden, he continued these false claims.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump holds a news conference about the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic in the Rose garden at the White House, March 13, 2020 in Washington. Trump declared a national emergency.

The travel restrictions start Friday at midnight.\\n\\nNo contact, no test\\n\\nAfter learning that a senior Brazilian official who met in person with the president over the weekend had tested positive for the virus, questions were immediately raised about whether or not the president should be tested, or even quarantined.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro before attending a working dinner at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., March 7, 2020. Tom Brenner/Reuters\\n\\nIn response, the president\\'s press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, stated the president does not need to be tested for COVID-19 because \"both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time.\"\\n\\nHowever, in a photo posted by Wajngarten on Instagram, it clearly shows Trump side-by-side touching the Brazilian president\\'s press secretary who tested positive for COVID-19 days after their meeting. They had contact on multiple occasions.\\n\\nUPDATE: The president has since taken the test and the White House announced on Saturday that his results came back negative.\\n\\nNo results found A key claim Trump and Vice President Mike Pence made at their Friday press conference was that Google would soon finish a website that lets Americans input their symptoms and find out if they needed to be tested for the coronavirus. If the answer was yes, the website would tell users where to go.\\n\\nBut it immediately became clear that Trump and Pence significantly misrepresented what Google was actually doing.\\n\\nIn reality, a research arm of Google’s parent company, Verily, said later that day it was “in the early stages of development” of such a site, that it would be rolled out in the San Francisco Bay Area and that the company had the “hope of expanding more broadly over time.”\\n\\nThat was entirely different than Trump’s claim Friday: “Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past.”\\n\\nTrump, providing no source for his information, added: “Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They\\'ve made tremendous progress.”\\n\\nIt wasn’t just Trump who was misleading. Ambassador Deborah Birx, the White House’s point person on coronavirus, held up a poster with a flow chart showing how it would work.\\n\\nOn Saturday, pressed by reporters on the discrepancies, Pence read a statement from Google, but only mentioned the Bay Area when a reporter followed up. He said the website would be ready by Monday – Google has not publicly committed to that – and said the “objective here is to have a website up very quickly” available to “people in the areas that have been deeply impacted.”\\n\\nA Google spokesperson issued a statement later Saturday that said \"Google is partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information.\"\\n\\nBut the spokesperson reiterated that the site Trump, Pence, and Birx described -- where you could enter your symptoms -- was a \"pilot\" site developed by Verily and was limited to the Bay Area. The spokesperson did not provide a timeframe.\\n\\nUPDATE: On Sunday the president told reporters the media had misreported his claims and that google had \"substantiated\" his claims. He added the \"head of google\" called and \"apologized.\" Google has not responded to a request for comment from ABC News about the alleged apology.\\n\\nWhat to know about Coronavirus:\\n\\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: Coronavirus explained\\n\\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: Coronavirus symptoms\\n\\nTracking the spread in the US and Worldwide: Coronavirus map', 'Donor recently at Mar-a-Lago tests positive for coronavirus, according to Trump Victory email Trump Victory on Friday informed donors who attended the fundraiser.\\n\\nTrump Victory on Friday informed donors via email who attended a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday that a donor who also attended the event has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to an email obtained by ABC News.\\n\\n\"We unfortunately write today to notify you that an attendee at the Trump Victory-sponsored event you attended at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, March 8, has tested positive for the Coronavirus,\" the joint committee between the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee wrote in an email sent today.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump holds a news conference about the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic in the Rose garden at the White House, March 13, 2020 in Washington.

Echoes of \\'30s in viral crisis? No one knows how this recession may unfold or how effectively the government\\'s rescue programs might help\\n\\nWASHINGTON -- The imagery floats in sepia-colored photographs, faintly recalled images of bedraggled people lined up for bread or soup. Shacks in Appalachian hollows. Ruined investors taking their lives in the face of stock market crashes. Desperation etched on the faces of a generation that would soon face a world war.\\n\\nBy now, it\\'s hard to find someone whose grandparents are old enough to recall the suffering of the Great Depression or the stream of rescue programs the government unleashed in response to it. All but gone, too, are memories of President Franklin Roosevelt\\'s “fireside chats,” his attempts to console an anxious populace and quell the “fake news” rumors of the day.\\n\\nNearly a century later, the U.S. economy is all but shut down, and layoffs are soaring at small businesses and major industries. A devastating global recession looks inevitable. Deepening the threat, a global oil price war has erupted. Some economists foresee an economic downturn to rival the Depression.\\n\\n“With the markets destroying wealth so quickly, the two shocks we’re seeing globally — the coronavirus and the oil-price war — could morph into a financial crisis,” said Carmen Reinhart, a professor of economics and finance at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. “We will see higher default rates and business failures. It could be like the 1930s.”\\n\\nDuring the early Depression years, unemployment peaked at 25%. U.S. economic output plunged nearly 30%. Thousands of banks failed. Millions of homeowners faced foreclosure. Businesses failed.\\n\\nNo one knows how this recession may unfold or how effectively the government\\'s rescue programs might help. Ignited by an external event — a raging global pandemic — it is uniquely different from both the Depression and the financial meltdown of 2008-09. And so its possible solutions are trickier.\\n\\nIt isn\\'t a conventional dislocation rooted in a financial collapse or an overheated economy or a burst asset bubble. The twist this time is that the only sure way to defeat the pandemic — with drastic containment measures like lockdowns, quarantines and business closures — is to deliberately cause a recession by bringing business and social life to a halt.\\n\\nJames Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, has gone so far as to warn that unemployment could reach 30% within months and that economic output could shrink 50%. Other outlooks aren\\'t quite as grim. But they\\'re all bleak.\\n\\nSome economists take heart from the fact that the government possesses more potent tools to stabilize the economy than it did in the 1930s, some of them created in response to the Depression. They include a social safety net in unemployment insurance, a guarantee of bank deposits and federally backed mortgages. And the 2008 financial crisis led to the creation of an array of programs to fortify the banking system and encourage borrowing and spending.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump, after a hesitant start, now backs a bold and multi-pronged federal response to the crisis. It is just the sort of sweeping government involvement in the economy that was pushed this year by Democratic presidential candidates, well before the viral outbreak, but is almost always resisted by Trump and other Republicans.\\n\\nAfter days of negotiations between congressional leaders and White House officials, Congress edged toward an agreement Tuesday on legislation that would deliver, by far, the largest economic rescue plan in U.S. history. At somewhere around $2 trillion, the wide-ranging aid package is intended to sustain workers and companies for at least 10 weeks. After that, further help might be needed.\\n\\nThe final package is expected to include, among other things, one-time cash payments of $1,200 to individuals and $3,000 for a family of four; more generous unemployment benefits for workers sidelined by the virus; an extension of that coverage to gig workers and independent contractors; and small business loans to help retain workers. An earlier $100 billion-plus package passed by Congress last Wednesday and signed by Trump includes a guarantee of paid sick leave for some workers affected by the virus.\\n\\nA major element of the government\\'s intervention will continue to be the Federal Reserve, which is injecting trillions of dollars in liquidity into the financial system to support key lending programs. On Monday, the Fed unleashed its boldest effort yet to protect the U.S. economy by helping companies and governments pay their bills. With lending markets threatening to shut down, the Fed\\'s intervention is intended to ensure that households, companies, banks and governments can get the loans they need at a time when their own revenue is drying up.\\n\\nAs a whole, the emerging all-guns-blazing federal response is at least an echo of the economic stimulus that Roosevelt engineered in the depths of the Depression. Huge government aid programs put tens of millions to work in the construction of public buildings and roads, the pursuit of conservation projects and development of the arts.\\n\\nRural poverty was addressed, in part, by buying low-producing land owned by poor farmers and resettling them in group farms. Fannie Mae was created to buy home mortgages issued by the Federal Housing Administration. After the immediate crisis passed, Congress enacted far-reaching reforms of the financial system and banks and established unemployment insurance.\\n\\nIn contrast to today, the 1930s workforce was predominantly a male-dominated one of manual and farm labor. That changed only later, when the “Rosie the Riveter” wave of women entered factories to help mobilize America to fight World War II — a mobilization whose economic boost finally ended the Depression.\\n\\nToday\\'s service sector-dominated 21st century economy, populated more by retail, technology and financial services as well as by contractors, freelancers and “gig” workers, is far different. A 2020 equivalent of the Works Progress Administration would be hard to imagine.\\n\\nIn today\\'s environment, more likely than government-created jobs are temporary measures like cash payments and guaranteed paid sick leave. Yet the options for the government are so vast that experts say they could deliver a significant benefit if deployed properly.\\n\\n“There are more levers now for the government,” says Richard Grossman, who teaches economic and financial history at Wesleyan University. “There’s a lot now that the government can do that it wouldn’t even have thought of doing in the 1930s.”\\n\\nAn example was a rarely used 1950s-era lever that Trump invoked last week — the Defense Production Act. It empowers the government to marshal private industry to accelerate production of key supplies in the name of national security. (Critics complain that Trump has yet to put the law fully into action by actually ordering companies to make protective masks and other equipment that hospitals say are running dangerously low.)\\n\\nAlso last week, the president said he was open to giving the government a vast reach into the private sector — by taking equity stakes in companies that have been crippled by the virus, in exchange for giving the companies emergency loans.\\n\\nThis would recall the 2008-09 financial crisis, when the government engineered a $700 billion bailout of banks and automakers — and, in exchange, acquired equity stakes in those companies. That enabled the government to profit years later, when the companies repaid the taxpayer bailouts. The government took over outright the home mortgage backers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\\n\\n“Right now, the country’s frozen,” said Anat Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford University and senior fellow at Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. \"Policymakers have to decide what’s really best for society.\"\\n\\nAdmati notes that FDR’s New Deal and unemployment insurance wove a new safety net after the ravages of the Depression. But the net has eroded over the last decade, she says, along with the rise in gig and part-time workers and low-paid staffers in health care and other service industries. Many of those workers don\\'t stand to benefit much, if at all, from unemployment benefits and other programs built for a different era.\\n\\nA result is that income inequality could worsen as a result of the crisis and the economic and social dislocation it causes.\\n\\n“There are bailouts and subsidies coming,\" Admati said. \"The key is how they are targeted.”\\n\\n—\\n\\nFollow Gordon on Twitter at @mgordonap', 'Americans stranded overseas grow frustrated with State Dept. response The State Dept. says take commercial flights, but for many it\\'s too late.\\n\\nNOTE: The State Department is urging all Americans stranded overseas to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) at step.state.gov so that they receive the latest information, including on possible repatriation flights, from the local U.S. embassy.

That total includes more than 800 from Wuhan, China -- the original hot zone of the novel coronavirus -- and more than 300 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan, meaning about 4,600 have returned in recent days, including 1,200 from Morocco and over 600 from Peru.\\n\\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\\n\\nThat\\'s still less than half of those who have reached out to U.S. embassies and consulates around the world asking for help -- a total of at least 13,500 Americans, according to the senior official.

Alex Halada/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nThe department and its new repatriation task force, led by Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Ian Brownlee, are focused on evacuating the most vulnerable first -- those at higher risk of contracting the virus, known as COVID-19, or -- like many Americans who have contacted ABC News -- those running out of life-sustaining medications or food.\\n\\nBut the senior official said they cannot guarantee that they will be able to reach every American.\\n\\n\"I\\'m hesitant to give a guarantee we can move every single person,\" the senior official said, especially those in the \"most remote locations.\"\\n\\nInstead, they urged Americans who can still travel commercially to do so immediately or be prepared to hunker down where they are -- but for thousands, it\\'s already too late.\\n\\nTo carry out this \"unprecedented\" operation, the official said, the U.S. government is using a \"variety of means,\" including aircraft from the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. That includes an Air Force aircraft that picked up a women\\'s football team and others from Honduras late last week, and DHS planes that are deporting migrants from the U.S. to Central America and then turning around to bring U.S. citizens home.\\n\\nBut the department is focusing its efforts on chartering commercial aircraft, with the senior official saying that was the most \"efficient way.\" These are paid for using an emergency State Department fund and money collected from those Americans who are repatriated. No one has to pay up front, but they are required to sign a promissory note with a specific sum.\\n\\n\"\\'Whole of government\\' is a cliche. This is more of a whole of possibility effort to get people out,\" said the senior official, briefing reporters Monday, \"so no option is foreclosed.\"\\n\\nTo arrange these flights though, the department has to get permission from local governments, made even more difficult after they\\'ve closed their borders, and from U.S. authorities at DHS and the Federal Aviation Administration. The task force has been working around the clock to do that, the official said, for chartered flights arranged by the U.S. or by private companies and citizens.\\n\\nTravelers wait to take a charter flight coordinated by the U.S. embassy at La Aurora airport in Guatemala City, March 23, 2020.

They may also not have internet service or broadband speed.”\\n\\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\\n\\nAs the novel coronavirus continues to spread across the country, infecting more than 160,000 people in the United States alone – the most confirmed cases of any country in the world – Americans continue to try to “flatten the curve” by self-quarantining inside their homes and physically distancing themselves from others.\\n\\nSo medical leaders from across the country pushed for regulations surrounding telehealth – health services through telecommunication technology – to change, trying to ensure healthcare providers could properly take care of their patients, as well as get paid for the work they do.\\n\\nTwo staff members wheel Amwell telemedicine carts into the entrance of the University of California San Francisco Benioff Children\\'s Hospital during an outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus, March 16, 2020. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images\\n\\n“One of the ways, and in a critical way, that we can continue to offer health services – where appropriate – is the use of telehealth,” said Dr. Patrice Harris, the President of the American Medical Association, recommending medical practices of all specialties should look into telehealth to keep providing services to their patients.\\n\\nThat’s why Skillings, Harris, and other leaders in the medical field pushed – and are continuing to advocate for – CMS, state regulators, and private insurance companies to expand their policies to accommodate situations where simultaneous two-way audio and video capabilities are impossible.\\n\\nBut challenges still remain.\\n\\nWhile CMS expanded access to neuropsychological and psychological testing by allowing telehealth for the first time, it still does not cover \\u200btypical therapy services by phone, according to Dr. Stephen Gillaspy, APA’s director of health care financing.\\n\\nThis temporary deregulation – that ignored therapy sessions – came just a day after President Trump suggested that there will be a rise in depression, saying \"You\\'re going to have mental depression for people. You\\'re going to have large numbers of suicides.” And yet, access to phone-only therapy for Americans covered by CMS is unavailable.\\n\\n“Now, that makes no sense for all kinds of vulnerable populations, older adults, people with lower-income, folks with disabilities,\" said Skillings. \"I\\'ll give you the best example I have heard from one of my best friend colleagues -- she said, ‘Why should people who are visually impaired have to do a video chat?’ That makes no sense.”\\n\\nAdditionally, the regulatory waiver is only temporary.\\n\\nCMS is federally run, but insurance – including telehealth policies – is regulated at the state level. Every state and every private health insurance company has different policies. To add to the complexity, tens of millions of Americans are not insured, and tens of millions more are on self-insured plans, which have different policies than those who are fully insured.\\n\\nBecause there isn’t a one-answer-fits-all policy nationwide, patients can have a hard time recognizing which policy applies to them, furthering the difficulty of finding the proper care they need.\\n\\nAnd because it is fundamentally up to the states to adopt these new rules and regulations, this will result in a fragmented adoption of policies and make it more difficult for multi-state providers according to Dr. Bill Mills, Chief Medical Officer at BrightSpring Health Services, a large, multi-state provider of intellectual or developmental disability and behavioral health services.\\n\\n“As this goes forward, the people who are the most vulnerable already are also going to be the people who are the most impacted by this crisis,” said Skillings. “And so therefore, we need to make sure we take the most care -- we need to take care of everybody -- but we need to make especially sure we take care of them too.”\\n\\nThe business of telehealth\\n\\nWhile emergency rooms scramble to address the influx of potential COVID-19 patients, many non-emergency doctors and health care providers are seeing a significant decrease in the number of patients they see, leading some to develop concerns about making ends meet. Providers such as gynecologists and pediatricians have said the number of patients they see has dropped significantly. Some have reduced their patient load from 40 a day to five.\\n\\nHarris says, “the pandemic is impacting practices all across the board, impacting outpatient practices all across the board, diversity of specialties and a diversity of settings, from the larger practices to the small one.”\\n\\nDr. Patrice A. Harris speaks onstage during an event in Atlanta, March 07, 2020. Paras Griffin/Getty Images, FILE\\n\\nFrom a public health perspective, Harris believes this is in the best interest of the patients in many cases, saying “we are urging everyone to stay home unless they have an urgent or emergent need.” She says not going into a doctor\\'s office limits the risk of infection for both the patient and the provider, and it saves necessary medical equipment – like masks – for providers directly dealing with the coronavirus.\\n\\nWhile Harris says postponing a yearly physical check-up is okay, she said that many patients should be able to get the care they need through telehealth.\\n\\nAccording to the AMA, physician use of virtual visits doubled from 14% in 2016 to 28% in 2019. While data has not yet been released on the increase of tele-visits since the coronavirus outbreak, the AMA has said it is expecting a significant increase and reliance on telehealth during the pandemic.\\n\\nIn the past, healthcare providers could only use HIPAA-compliant telecommunication services, which would protect both the patient and the provider through advanced encryption technology.\\n\\nBut on March 17, Trump relaxed the rules, allowing FaceTime and Skype.\\n\\n“The crisis is going to go longer,” said Skillings. “And so because that\\'s the case, we\\'re not just looking at emergency conditions. At this point, we\\'re trying to look at how can we provide care potentially for several weeks or even a few months.”\\n\\nIt\\'s still complicated\\n\\nUnderstanding health insurance is notoriously difficult and Skillings warns there is a risk of relying on the rules and regulations set forth by the federal government.\\n\\n“One of the things that providers also need to know is that even if the federal government waves some of their own regulations, states still have privacy restrictions, some of which are in place,” said Skillings.\\n\\nStates have taken a variety of approaches in dealing with the coronavirus – whether that means issuing stay-at-home orders or limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people. Telehealth is no different. Some states have championed the use of telehealth, like Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine allowed Medicaid to cover mental health service visits through video or phone-only sessions. States like Maryland, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Rhode Island have similar policies.\\n\\nGovernor Mike DeWine speaks during a press conference to update the public on efforts to fight the coronavirus on Sunday, March 15, 2020, at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus. The Columbus Dispatch via USA Today Network, FILE\\n\\nGovernors from California, Illinois, and Massachusetts have taken executive action to address the payment discrepancies between tele-visits and in-person visits, now requiring tele-visits to pay providers the same as in-person visits.\\n\\nBut several states, including Alabama, Idaho, and Wyoming have not taken steps to facilitate broad telehealth access according to medical leaders.\\n\\nInsurance companies, just like the states, have issued different guidance regarding telehealth. Scott Serota, CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS), which provides coverage to more than 106 million Americans, said in an online statement that BCBS is “also advocating for physician and health system adoption of ... video, chat and/or e-visits.”\\n\\n“A member can have any of those functions and be able to utilize ‘alternative’ visits,” Dr. Vincent Nelson, vice president of medical affairs and interim Chief Medical Officer at Blue Cross Blue Shield Association told ABC News. “However, their provider will also need to have the capability and will vary based on the individual Blue Cross and Blue Shield company.”\\n\\nSince insurance is state-regulated, what is considered appropriate telehealth engagements will vary on a state-by-state basis, meaning BCBS has different policies based on each state. The BCBS Texas policy allows for \"2-way, live interactive telephone or digital video consultations,\" while the Illinois policy is stricter, not allowing for phone-only visits, saying it allows for \"2-way, live interactive telephone communication and digital video consultations” – meaning the video and audio need to be simultaneous.\\n\\nCoping with the help of telemedicine\\n\\nThe busier the day, the better. That’s how Nina Tang – a varsity athlete, an undergrad researcher at a Columbia University science lab, a pre-med senior at Barnard College – enjoyed spending her time.\\n\\nBut as Americans try to mitigate the risk of infection by staying at home, they need to find ways to cope with the isolation of the pandemic.\\n\\nTang said she’s been isolating in her apartment in New York City for over two weeks, only getting a breath of fresh air if she sits on her windowsill. She hasn’t seen anyone – outside of FaceTime – since March 21, the day her second roommate left the city. She said it\\'s been \"difficult at times.\"\\n\\nThe Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine on the Upper West Side of Manhattan is seen from the window of Nina Tang\\'s apartment, which she hasn\\'t left in two weeks, March 31, 2020. Courtesy Nina Tang\\n\\nShe said she has had issues with her mental health in the past – last spring, she had a hard time dealing with anxiety and depression. Since then, she’s been seeing a therapist weekly, where she felt comfortable “talking about anything that I was experiencing.”\\n\\nNow, during this crisis, her therapy sessions have moved to video chat.\\n\\n“We try to do video sessions,” Tang, who has private health insurance, told ABC News. “And we did that for our last meeting. There were a couple of meetings where either I wasn\\'t in great internet connection, or I just couldn\\'t get to great internet connection, so we would just have phone calls.”\\n\\nBut telehealth isn’t perfect for Tang, saying the sessions have felt \"very different.\" She finds herself \"not wanting to talk about how this whole situation with coronavirus, like self-quarantining, has affected\" her.\\n\\nTang said her anxiety stems from the fear of being asymptomatic and then passing the coronavirus onto someone else.\\n\\n“I don’t want to be a carrier,” she said. “And be responsible for someone else’s sickness or potential death.”\\n\\nMental health experts suggest feelings of anxiety, fear and depression are normal.\\n\\n“It\\'s no wonder that anxiety is going up right now,” said Skillings of the APA.\\n\\nSkillings says to keep a regular schedule by waking up, eating, and sleeping at the same time each day. He recommends exercising daily and finding time to socially engage with people – whether that means having a virtual happy hour, calling a friend or a family member, or sending an old-fashioned note in the mail. Nina Tang has come to a similar solution as well.\\n\\n“I try and have a very structured day, where I can at least point to different things that I accomplished that I can feel proud of later,” she said.\\n\\n“There are people who have it worse than me,” Tang added. “And so I think there\\'s been a strange balance between trying to validate the way that I\\'m feeling, but then also trying to keep in mind that I am probably on the more fortunate end of some people who are also going through the same things.”\\n\\nWhat to know about coronavirus:\\n\\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: coronavirus explained\\n\\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: coronavirus symptoms\\n\\nTracking the spread in the US and Worldwide: coronavirus map', 'Faces of the coronavirus pandemic: Remembering those who died Over 12,000 people have died from the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.\\n\\nFrom a \"Good Morning America\" camera operator to a 30-year-old former college athlete, more than 12,000 people have died in the United States in the last several weeks from the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nThose we\\'ve lost come from all backgrounds and walks of life and include the very people -- first responders and medical staff, who are working so diligently to stem the tide of the infection and care for the sick.

Major Olympic nations like Canada and Australia have added pressure by saying they will not send teams if the games are staged this year.\\n\\nInternational Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach sent a letter to athletes explaining the decision, while also acknowledging the extended timeline might not be popular.\\n\\n“I know that this unprecedented situation leaves many of your questions open,” he wrote. “I also know that this rational approach may not be in line with the emotions many of you have to go through.”\\n\\nThe IOC\\'s move seemed inevitable for weeks with pressure mounting from all quarters — athletes, sponsors, broadcasters, more than 200 national Olympic committees and international sports federations.\\n\\nShortly after Bach\\'s statement, the Canadian Olympic Committee said it would not send athletes to the Olympics unless the games are postponed by a year. Australia issued a statement saying it was advising its athletes to prepare for an Olympics in 2021.\\n\\nJohn Coates is the head of the Australian Olympic Committee and the IOC member who heads the inspection team for Tokyo.\\n\\nWorld Athletics President Sebastian Coe sent a letter to Bach saying that holding the Olympics in July “is neither feasible nor desirable.” He outlined a number of reasons, including competitive fairness, the likelihood athletes would overtrain if given a compressed schedule and the uncertainty caused by orders in many countries barring people from gyms and other workout venues.\\n\\nNational Olympic committees in Brazil and Slovenia had also called for postponement until 2021. Norway’s Olympic body said it did not want athletes going to Tokyo until the global health crisis is under control.\\n\\nThe United States governing bodies of swimming and track — two of the three top-tier Summer Games sports — had called on their national Olympic officials to push for a postponement.\\n\\nJapan\\'s politicians fell in line quickly on Monday as they awakened to Bach\\'s move, which was announced at 3 a.m. in Tokyo as most of the city slept.\\n\\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking at a parliamentary session, said a postponement of the Tokyo Olympics would be necessary if the games cannot be held in a complete way because of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\n“If it is difficult to hold (the games) in a complete way, a decision of postponement would be unavoidable,” he said.\\n\\nAbe said he hoped the IOC would announce a decision quickly, and Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike echoed him.\\n\\nThe IOC holds most of the cards in any rescheduling, spelled out in a Host City Contract signed in 2013 between the IOC, the Japanese Olympic Committee and the city of Tokyo.\\n\\nJapan is officially spending $12.6 billion to organize the Olympics, but a national audit put the figure at more than twice that much. The bill is sure to increase with any postponement, and the vast majority of the spending if from the public treasury.\\n\\nThe IOC has a reserve fund of about $2 billion to tide itself over, and also has insurance against postponement or cancellation.\\n\\nYoshiro Mori, the president of the organizing committee, said he talked with Bach by teleconference about the delay and was joined by CEO Toshiro Muto.\\n\\n“Honestly speaking, four weeks is quite a short time to consider all the necessary elements.\" Mori said at a Monday news conference. “It requires a tremendous amount of time and we have to hurry to go through this.”\\n\\nBoth were asked about added cost, and who would pay. And both shied away from a direct response.\\n\\nMori said cost calculations had to be made, and the availability of venues — presumably for next summer in the northern hemisphere — had to be examined. A decision also has to be made about who pays for the maintenance of venues if the Olympics are postponed.\\n\\nSimilar questions will be asked about the massive Olympic Village, which is to house 11,000 Olympians and 4,400 Paralympians before the high-priced units around Tokyo Bay are sold off by private developers.\\n\\n“I respect Mr. Bach,” Mori said. “And we trust Mr. Bach. We have been always together walking side by side. I consider Mr. Bach as my best friend.\"\\n\\nThe 82-year-old Mori, a former prime minister who has been undergoing treatment for an undisclosed illness, was asked if he could endure more work on the Olympics.\\n\\nHe called it a “rude” question.\\n\\n“I\\'ve got about two years left to live,” he replied, half smiling as he said it.\\n\\nThe Olympic torch arrived last Friday in northern Japan from Greece. The torch relay it set to begin on Thursday from Fukushima prefecture, the area devastated by the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and the meltdown of three nuclear reactors. Organizers said the relay is still on, but said plans could change very quickly.\\n\\nOn Sunday, thousands crowded the northern city of Sendai to view the flame, which forced organizers the restrict the entry for viewing.\\n\\nJeff Kingston, who studies Japanese politics at Temple University in Tokyo, said postponed Olympics will be a minor worry for most people.\\n\\n\"The public is expecting and supports postponement, so it won\\'t be a big deal,\" Kingston said in an email to The Associated Press. “People are way more worried about the economic consequences and their jobs and if the number of cases ramps up.\"\\n\\nA recent poll by the Japanese news agency Kyodo said 69.9% did not expect the Olympics to open on schedule.\\n\\nAs of Sunday, Japan had 1,719 confirmed cases of the virus, including 712 from a cruise ship, with 43 deaths.\\n\\nFormer IOC marketing director Michael Payne said the delay might work to the advantage of the IOC and Japan.\\n\\n“What better platform is there going to be than the Olympic Games when the world has pulled through the virus,” Payne told the AP in an interview Sunday, just before the IOC announcement. “You\\'ve got a dynamic that will be even more powerful for Japan and the rest of the world.

Consider this chart, which compares COVID-19 to the flu using the most recently compiled statistics.\\n\\nInfluenza vs COVID-19 ABC Photo Illustration\\n\\nIt\\'s still unclear exactly how deadly novel coronavirus is.

Andrew Cuomo announced on Thursday, a move that could help the state make better use of its scarce supply of lifesaving breathing machines as the outbreak continues to surge.\\n\\nNew York-Presbyterian Hospital has developed a split-ventilation protocol that has been shared with the New York State Department of Health, which quickly approved the practice.\\n\\nCalling the technique “not ideal, but workable,” Cuomo said ventilator splitting may be necessary given some projections that suggest the state may need as many as 30,000 ventilators in the coming weeks.\\n\\nThe practice is controversial, and the move drew immediate criticism in a joint statement issued by several medical associations advising clinicians “that sharing mechanical ventilators should not be attempted because it cannot be done safely with current equipment.”\\n\\nMedical staff treat a patient in a Covid-19 ward at the Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York on Monday, March 23, 2020.

The state has also received 400 machines from the federal government’s stockpile.\\n\\n“Why such a demand? It is a respiratory illness for a large number of people. So they all need ventilators,” Cuomo said Thursday. “Non-COVID patients are normally on ventilators for three to four days. COVID patients are on ventilators for 11 to 21 days. You don't have the same turnaround.”\\n\\nWith the country facing a potential shortage of hundreds of thousands of ventilators, according to some projections, the technique could soon be replicated in hospitals nationwide.\\n\\nOther states are conducting experiments of their own: Tufts University Medical Center in Massachusetts is working on a similar protocol that could allow up to four patients to use a single ventilator at once.\\n\\nIn this March 24, 2020 photo, New York Gov.

On Monday, the prime minister declared a \"moment of national emergency\" – as he announced that across the U.K. the public could only leave the house for one form of daily exercise and essential shopping, while gatherings of more than two people have been banned.\\n\\nCases of the novel coronavirus have been steadily rising in the country, with 11,816 cases confirmed so far and 578 deaths attributed to the virus, according to the latest data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.', \"Keep your car clean to reduce risk from coronavirus The coronavirus can spread quickly inside a contained space such as the interior of a vehicle\\n\\nThe spread of the novel coronavirus, and its associated COVID-19 disease, is made worse because it is highly contagious. Since vehicle interiors are essentially small contained spaces, it is important to take steps to reduce the risk of contracting the virus while driving or riding inside.\\n\\nWhen it comes to vehicles, washing your hands thoroughly is one of the most effective ways to prevent transmission of the virus, which is spread from small droplets from the nose or mouth when an infected person coughs, sneezes or exhales.\\n\\nBut proper cleaning and disinfecting are also advised. That's because the virus can exist on a variety of surfaces, sometimes even days after contagious droplets we\\xad\\xadre planted there. The experts at Edmunds recommend these tips to increase your safety during the outbreak.\\n\\nBE PREPARED\\n\\nWhile it's important that the inside of your vehicle is clean, it's just as important that your hands are free of germs too. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands for at least 20 seconds before or after eating, using the restroom, coughing or sneezing, caring for others, and leaving your house.\\n\\nCleaning your vehicle should also be on the list. It may also be a good idea to use disposable or designated gloves while cleaning to prevent the spread of the coronavirus inside.\\n\\nLimiting your trips outside is the most effective method of ensuring you won't contract the coronavirus or spread it to others. Restrict your movement to essential tasks only. This will reduce the spread of germs into your vehicle and prevent you from carrying them to the outside world or back inside your home.\\n\\nUSE THE RIGHT TOOLS\\n\\nThe right disinfectants can kill the coronavirus so that it doesn't live on surfaces such as rubber, plastic, aluminum and leather. Most common household cleaners will work. The American Chemistry Council has a helpful list of specific EPA-approved products for use against the coronavirus. We recommend keeping a tube of disinfectant wipes in your vehicle for regular use.\\n\\nCheck to ensure that the cleaners you're using are safe for the surfaces in your car. Some disinfectants can dry out leather. A safer option would be to use a mild soap and water, then apply a leather conditioner to protect those surfaces. This option will not kill germs as well as harsher disinfectants, but it will greatly reduce them and help prevent spread.\\n\\nFOCUS ON TOUCHPOINTS\\n\\nThe main areas that need to be cleaned are obvious. Anything inside the car that your fingers touch should be cleaned: the steering wheel, gear shifter, lane change and windshield wiper stalks, door handles, radio knobs, infotainment controllers, storage bins and seat belts. The CDC recommends cleaning touched surfaces daily.\\n\\nOne other area might not be so immediately evident: The top of the dashboard is a prime spot for harboring such microorganisms, according to Charles P. Gerba, a professor of microbiology and public health at the University of Arizona. Recirculating air swirls up against the windshield and sticks to the dash, where it can be distributed throughout the cabin, Gerba said. Cleaning that spot reduces risk.\\n\\nCHILDREN AND THE ELDERLY\\n\\nPeople who are regularly in contact with both children and the elderly should take extra precautions, even if those two groups are not sharing the same airspace at the same time. That's because children are often less careful about hygiene and cleanliness, while the elderly are more susceptible to any germs left behind.\\n\\nPeople over the age of 60 and those with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer have the highest risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. But proper and regular cleaning inside the car can greatly reduce the risk of passing the virus on from children and others.\\n\\nEDMUNDS SAYS: Maintaining cleanliness in your car is a small act that can go a long way toward the greater good. If you are going to take trips outside, do everything you can to slow or prevent the transmission of the coronavirus.

What once appeared to be a scourge that was primarily affecting the elderly and those with underlying health issues has now been revealed to hospitalize and kill those who are younger, seemingly at an alarming rate.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not loaded, I don\\'t have a fortune for people to fight over, but I have two small kids,\" Waters said. \"I definitely want to make sure that if something happens to my husband or I, our wishes are put down in legal form.\"\\n\\nShe said in speaking to different police officers and other first responders, \"Everyone is saying, I should probably get a will done just in case.\"\\n\\nA person fills out a document to create a will. STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\\n\\nMarked increase\\n\\nRenee Fry, the CEO of Gentreo, an online estate-planning platform, told ABC News that they saw a 143% increase week-over-week in people creating wills with them last week, and she predicts it will be an event larger uptick this week, estimating it\\'s \"probably closer 220%.\"\\n\\n\"In the past, people thought this was only for the wealthy, it\\'s not,\" she said.\\n\\nFry emphasized that her service is legally-binding and state-specific, which is something you need to be especially cognizant of if you choose an online service.\\n\\n\"There might be things online, but if it\\'s not what your state requires, then you don\\'t have the documents you need to hold up in court,\" she said. \"Each state has a separate requirements.\"\\n\\nAnn-Margaret Carozza, an estate planning and asset protection attorney based in New York said in recent weeks she\\'s seen an approximately 50% increase in inquiries about \"all estate planning aspects.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had a lot of calls and email questions about doing healthcare-advanced directives,\" she said. \"This pandemic is causing us all to think about or it ... who we are naming to make healthcare decisions for us in the event that we are unable to speak.\"\\n\\n\"The calls about healthcare proxies were so great that I just put the PDF-downloadable form on my website,\" she added. \"It\\'s good in all 50 states, it does not have to be notarized.\"\\n\\nIn addition to healthcare proxies (giving someone the power to make medical decisions on your behalf in the event you are unable) and wills, Carozza said clients have been reaching out to create all sorts of often-overlooked legal documents amid the pandemic.\\n\\n\"There is one very interesting aspect to this and I think it may come from the very solitary nature of the most severe cases, where patients don\\'t have interaction with family members at the end, that people are asking me for guidance on doing what I call ethical wills,\" she said. \"A normal will simply distributes my property at my death, an ethical will is where someone can put forth words of wisdom for their family members and loved ones.\"\\n\\nCarozza said she has also seen an uptick in inquiries for creating trusts.\\n\\n\"I feel like there is a general sense that parents want to make things easier and smoother for their children, and in many cases that might be doing a trust instead of a will,\" she said. \"A trust takes effect immediately upon a parent\\'s death and is really like a gift to the next generation in terms of simplicity.\"\\n\\nThere are several key differences between wills and trusts. Wills set forth how a person wishes to dispose of his or her property upon his or her death. Trusts, which can vary some what, hand the legal title for property to someone else -- they can be more flexible and have a wider range of uses, according to FindLaw, a provider of online legal information for consumers and small businesses.\\n\\nAnother key difference is that wills can face challenges in probate court, whereas a trust is not subject to probate.\\n\\n\\'Critically important\\' for young parents\\n\\nWhile in the past people may have thought wills were only for older, terminally ill or wealthy people, Carozza said it is \"critically important\" for parents of young children to make one.\\n\\n\"Especially when we have minor children, it\\'s critically important to have a will to name guardians, otherwise it would be a court coming up with who they think would be in the best position to raise children,\" she said. \"Anyone who has children should have a will done.\"\\n\\nOne of the most surprising aspects of the pandemic, Carozza added, is that it is making people rethink who they want to take care of their children.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had calls where people have named siblings as guardians, but they don\\'t like how cavalier people are taking the social distancing,\" she said.\\n\\nWhile online will services have exploded in popularity in recent years, Carozza says she still discourages people from using them for the most part because of the \"room for error.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you can do an online will and you can do a will on a paper towel, and technically it\\'s effective, but your family will be in court with that document,\" she said. \"I would strongly encourage a person to do a will under the presence of an attorney.\"\\n\\n\"The probate laws of all 50 states state that a will executed under the supervision of an attorney is presumed to be legitimate,\" she added. \"The do-it-yourself will will be in the probate court for twice as long.\"\\n\\n\\'How fast can I get a will done?\\'\\n\\nDrew Hall, a financial adviser in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has recently redirected his services amid the pandemic to focus on helping people get their wills in order.\\n\\nHall told ABC News that he received a surprise text a little over a week ago from a friend who was a doctor saying simply: \"How fast can I get a will done?\"\\n\\n\"I just went \\'Oh man,\\'\" Hall said. \"For me it was like a lightning bolt hit. I have to do things differently for right now.\"\\n\\nHe said he then reached out to eight other people, including friends who work in the medical field, urging them to get their wills in order and not to wait until it\\'s too late.\\n\\nCurrently he is working as a liaison between estate attorneys and his clients and friends to help them create wills, something he says he is not getting paid for.\\n\\nDocuments including Will, Power of Attorney, and Healthcare Proxy.

He said he is currently calling in personal favors to notaries to get the wills authenticated as soon as possible.\\n\\nIn Louisiana and elsewhere, many attorneys have been in talks with local authorities to allow estate planning to be deemed an essential service amid the pandemic, according to Hall.\\n\\nState representative Selene Colburn, of Vermont, tweeted that she is working on legislation that would allow \"remote notarization processes for legal documents such as wills\" amid the COVID-19 crisis.\\n\\nA handful of states currently already allow remote online notarization, according to the National Notary Association.\\n\\nBecause of the \"coronavirus emergency,\" and the many stay-at-home orders, more than a dozen states have authorized temporary remote notarization services with state-specific guidelines.\\n\\n\"Notaries in these states must follow any rules set by the governor or state commissioning officials for these emergency authorizations,\" the NNA states on its website.\\n\\nRules for each of the states can be found on the NNA\\'s website.\\n\\nABC News\\' Kaylee Hartung contributed to this report.', 'Coronavirus is disproportionately killing the black community. Here\\'s what experts say can be done about it Numbers broken down by race have shocked the nation.\\n\\nAs the coronavirus continues to rip through the nation leaving behind thousands of victims in its path, black communities have been infected and their residents killed at a disproportionate rate across the country, according to several states\\' analysis of data.\\n\\n“After this virus is done infecting… it will expose a lot of weaknesses in the health care system. The world will not be the same,” said Dr. Tyson Bell, a pulmonology and intensive care physician at the University of Virginia and medical director of the intensive care unit.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided some limited data as political pressure to do so increased.\\n\\nBut while the portion of data released by the CDC did reveal racial disparities on a national scale, there were caveats. The data was pulled from a small sample size during a limited time frame -- 14 states during the month of March -- and race and ethnicity data was only available from 580 patients hospitalized for coronavirus, out of a total of 1,482 patients in the report.\\n\\nAccording to the CDC, even though the racial breakdown from the population in the report was 59% white, 14% Latino and 18% black, 45% of hospitalized coronavirus patients were white and 8% were Latino, while 33% were black, \"suggesting that black populations might be disproportionately affected by COVID-19.\"\\n\\nStill, it\\'s the largest amount of national data to have been provided so far -- and it sheds new light on racial disparities seen in cities and states across the country that have collected such data.\\n\\nSome states had previously begun releasing numbers broken down by race on their own and the rates shocked the nation.\\n\\nStates reporting numbers by race for COVID-19 include Michigan, Virginia, Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas and Louisiana. Some statistics raised alarms among health care professionals and community and government leaders that COVID-19 is affecting black communities disproportionately.\\n\\nLouisiana released data showing that while African-Americans only make up roughly 32% of the population they account for 70% of the deaths in the state\\n\\n“This is unprecedented. This has been a one of the hardest things I\\'ve ever had to do because you\\'ve got to get people to understand just how serious and devastating this thing is,\" said New Orleans City Councilman Jay Banks, who is also chairman of the historic Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure club -- a New Orleans-based Mardi Gras parade krewe -- which has lost six members to COVID-19.\\n\\nEMS personnel bring a patient into the emergency center at Ochsner Baptist Medical Center amid the coronavirus outbreak, in New Orleans, March 25, 2020. Jonathan Bachman/Reuters\\n\\nLouisiana isn’t the only state facing these harsh realities. Chicago, Milwaukee and Minnesota are finding themselves battling a disease that is taking the lives of the most vulnerable in their communities.\\n\\nIn Michigan, African-Americans have died at more than eight times the rate of white people despite making up only 14% of the state’s population.\\n\\nIn Illinois, 58% of Cook County deaths from COVID-19 were black though the population is 23% black, and 72% of Chicago deaths were black patients though the city is 32% black.\\n\\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said “those numbers take your breath away”, and “[the statistics were] among the most shocking things I think I’ve seen as mayor”.\\n\\nWhen the first reports of the COVID-19 outbreak surfaced from China, public health leaders feared if COVID-19 came to the U.S. it would devastate communities of color.\\n\\n“We had initial concerns when we first saw the outbreak coming, particularly the early reports out of China, and we recognized this may be a problem for communities of color,” Dr. Georges E. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association and emergency medicine physician said. “You had early evidence from Asia that showed that older folks, older than 60 or 65, with chronic disease would do worse when they got the infection. So when you put that together with the understanding that in this country you already have a [black] population disproportionately affected by disparities in things like diabetes, heart disease and asthma, we understood that if those populations got infected they would be more at risk.”\\n\\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\\n\\nHistorically, black populations have been affected differently by the rapid spread of infectious diseases.\\n\\nBenjamin drew parallels to how he witnessed the AIDS and opioid epidemics affect black communities as a frontline physician in the \\'80s.\\n\\n“I was around in the early days of the AIDS epidemic and watched that one ravage communities… and even how the opioid epidemic ravaged communities of color”, he said. He noted that outbreaks devastating communities of color have been a repeated theme throughout history.\\n\\nDr. Anthony Fauci, immunologist and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, raised similar concerns saying in a press briefing at the White House Tuesday that the disproportionate amount of deaths in the black community remind him of his work during the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\\n\\n“The greater proportion of my professional career has been defined by HIV/AIDS… African Americans dying at greater rates from COVID-19 could be a similar moment,” Fauci said.\\n\\nDr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Briefing Room, March 26, 2020, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP\\n\\nLeaders in medicine, public health and legal fields have decried the lack of wide reporting of race statistics as a fundamental injustice and an issue that has contributed to issues in understanding the full scope and depth of the disease\\'s impact on minorities.\\n\\n“States are reporting data along lines of geography, gender and age-- there is no defensible reason for excluding racial demographic data. Our ability to fully understand and confront this pandemic requires and demands that we obtain racial data,” said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization focused on addressing issues of inequity.\\n\\nBenjamin said he received early reports from health officials around the country that people of color were dying at a higher rate, but not being able to find data.\\n\\n“I got calls early on from some state health commissioners that they were seeing a disproportionate number of deaths in people of color,” Benjamin said. “When I initially went looking for the race information early on I couldn’t find it. At that point they were anecdotes and not evidence, but enough of them raise alarms.”\\n\\nUnfortunately, without data to show where and how the disparities were happening, alarms could not be raised quickly enough.\\n\\nSystemic barriers\\n\\nWhile the country comes to terms with how to attack the coronavirus crisis head on, another widely known and unaddressed crisis is complicating the response: systematic racism within the health care system.\\n\\nFauci on Tuesday at a White House briefing said that these health disparities have long been prevalent in the African American community and that this pandemic is “shining a bright light on how unacceptable that is.”\\n\\nA range of studies conducted by such organizations as the American Journal of Public Health and The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality over the past few decades have shown black people are less likely to have insurance and access to affordable medical testing.\\n\\nBlack Americans are also more likely to have underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma and if a patient with those underlying conditions gets a severe illness they tend to fare worse.\\n\\n“It’s not that they’re getting infected more often,” Fauci said. “It’s that when they do get infected, their underlying medical conditions ... wind them up in the ICU and ultimately give them a higher death rate.”\\n\\nPeople wait in line to for coronavirus testing outside Roseland Community Hospital in Chicago, April 7, 2020. Joshua Lott/Reuters\\n\\nAdditionally, implicit bias within the health care system has long played a factor in the wellness of black Americans.\\n\\n“Systemic racism and bias in the healthcare system have resulted in chronically poor health outcomes for Black Americans,” Kristen Clarke wrote in a letter Monday to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nStudies looking at manifestations of racial bias within the health care system have found black patients are sometimes treated differently than whites, leading to things such as undertreatment of pain and racial differences in what treatment is offered for a heart attack .\\n\\n“People are very leery of systems that don\\'t benefit them,” Banks said while discussing how the rate of African American deaths is partly representative of a system that is highly entrenched with inequality. “People are very leery of systems that have been disparaging towards them their whole life and all of a sudden you\\'re going to tell me you\\'re gonna run in and save me when you haven\\'t been trying to do that before,” Banks said.\\n\\nHe added, “It is not a talking point to bash some political party. The fact of it is that it\\'s real. There\\'s a definite disparity in medical care in this country, and people of color and poor people have less access to medical care, period.”\\n\\nWhere should the US go from here? Experts issue a government call to action\\n\\nHealth equity advocates and community leaders called out the federal government, as well as state and local health departments for their role in the coronavirus\\' disproportionately high impact in black communities.\\n\\n“We need to know [race statistics] in order to allocate health healthcare resources more equitably. We call on HHS to mandate the collection or racial demographic data so that we can actually see the impact on our most vulnerable communities,\" said Dr. Uche Blackstock, founder and CEO of Advancing Health Equity, and emergency medicine physician.\\n\\nDariely Rodriguez, director of the Economic Justice Project at the Lawyers\\' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, echoed the called for increased data disaggregated by race.\\n\\n“We will continue to call on the federal government and state and local departments to increase transparency and to shed light on how communities of color are being impacted during this pandemic,” Rodriguez said. “There\\'s absolutely no reason why we shouldn\\'t be collecting data on race because we know that it\\'s correlated with worse outcomes in certain communities, especially vulnerable communities. I think what\\'s important to remember here is that our leaders get their power from the public, and they are accountable to us, and accountability ultimately requires transparency.”\\n\\nBanks said that Louisiana Gov.John Bel Edwards is teaming up with local leaders across the state for target messaging to the black community.\\n\\nThe message: “This will kill you and kill people you care about. Period. You need to stay home, you have to.\"\\n\\nA message to physicians and patients\\n\\nFrontline physicians and public health leaders and health offered their perspective on what both physicians and patients can do when faced with the mounting COVID-19 disparities in communities of color.\\n\\n“Interfacing with the health care system can be daunting for black patients given how they have been treated historically and in current-day. I would encourage patients to be as fully informed as possible about COVID19 symptoms and try to bring a family member or friend to advocate for them in healthcare settings. Additionally, physicians must be mindful that while they make think they are providing unbiased care, the data tells us otherwise. Implicit bias has been implicated as a factor in the racialized health disparities,” Blackstock said.\\n\\nBenjamin offered that physicians considering the role of unconscious bias may be able to help change the trajectory.\\n\\n“I myself have to always do a little introspection and think about my own unconscious biases, and raise my index of suspicion. I think [more physicians doing this] would help the inequities a lot,” Benjamin said.\\n\\nMedical workers talk as people waiting in line to receive testing for COVID-19 outside Roseland Community Hospital, in Chicago, April 7, 2020. Joshua Lott/Reuters\\n\\nHe also suggested that if possible, black patients bring someone with them when seeking medical care to help be an advocate.\\n\\nBell said it\\'s important for physicians to speak out if they identify systemic barriers, work to remove them, and don’t take no for an answer. He used the example of restrictive testing in his state early on that may have contributed to the COVID-19 outcome disparities.\\n\\n“Early when Virginia was rolling out testing, we had a restrictive set of rules as to who could be tested or not,” Bell said. “We [at the University of Virginia] set up our own in house testing so that we didn’t have to depend on rules we didn\\'t think were appropriate or broad enough to really get a good sense [of who needs testing] and protect our community. We didn\\'t take no for an answer… and when barriers came up, we broke them.”\\n\\nNancy A.

Biden’s Deputy Campaign manager and Communication Director Kate Bedingfield released a statement encouraging those who are still well to go out and vote in primaries Tuesday, and suggesting those who are at risk or have been expose explore other ways to vote.\\n\\n“Voting is at the very heart of who we are as a democracy. As election officials working with public health officials are demonstrating throughout the country, our elections can be conducted safely in consultation with public health officials. If voters are feeling healthy, not exhibiting symptoms, and don’t believe they\\'ve been exposed to COVID-19, please vote on Tuesday. If voters are members of an at-risk population, exhibiting symptoms, or have been exposed to a diagnosed case of COVID-19, we encourage them to explore absentee ballots and vote by mail options,” Bedingfield’s statement read.\\n\\nMeanwhile, officials in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio released a joint statement saying they \"are confident that voters in our states can safely and securely cast their ballots in this election, and that otherwise healthy poll workers can and should carry out their patriotic duties on Tuesday.\"\\n\\n\"As each of our four states prepare for voters to head to the polls on Tuesday, March 17, 2020, we are working closely with our state health officials to ensure that our poll workers and voters can be confident that voting is safe,\" the statement read.\\n\\nSanders says postponing primaries is a \\'tough question,\\' campaign is \\'thinking through\\' work-arounds\\n\\nIn yet another press conference from his hometown of Burlington, Vermont on Friday--his third in three days-- Sen. Bernie Sanders again outlined proposals to address the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and pitched his signature Medicare for All plan, saying that the outbreak could be the turning point at which the public begins to question the fundamentals of the American health care system.\\n\\nWorking from a teleprompter -- something rare on the campaign trail for Sanders -- the senator largely repeated his remarks from Thursday, calling for scientists to take the lead on the response to the emergency, arguing that the costs of testing and treatment need to be made affordable, and pushing for the expansion of safety net programs for those economically impacted.\\n\\nAs to whether upcoming primaries should be delayed amid the pandemic, Sanders acknowledged it was a tough choice.\\n\\n\"Rescheduling elections is not something we do lightly or should do lightly.

I\\'m not blaming him or anything else. But he shouldn\\'t be talking about us.

And I see it’s sort of in that timeline that I’m thinking about. And I say, wouldn’t it be great to have all of the churches full?” Trump said. “I think Easter Sunday -- and you’ll have packed churches all over our country -- I think it would be a beautiful time.”\\n\\n“And it’s just about the timeline that I think is right,” the president continued. “It gives us more of a chance to work on what we’re doing.

What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000?\" Cuomo said. \"You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.\"\\n\\n\"The only way we can obtain these ventilators is from the federal government, period,\" Cuomo continued, criticizing the Trump administration’s delay in using the powers of the Defense Production Act. \"I need the ventilators in 14 days.

Let\\'s shut down the entire world because again you\\'re up to 150 countries,\\'\" Trump said, when asked whether any doctors on the task force agreed with his suggestion that social distancing guidelines will pay off in weeks not months.\\n\\n\"So, let\\'s shut down the entire world and when we shut it down, that\\'d be wonderful, and let\\'s keep it shut for a couple of years. We can\\'t do that,\" Trump said.\\n\\nThe president also predicted \"there will be tremendous death\" from shutting down the economy and job losses, \"probably\" more than the disease would cause.\\n\\nHe\\'s expected to expand on the topic in a town hall with Fox News Monday afternoon -- in an event appearing to replace, for now at least, the daily coronavirus task force briefing.\\n\\nState of the stimulus package: Negotiations continue, leaders signal Tuesday night vote\\n\\nAfter Senate Democrats successfully blocked the GOP-backed \"phase three\" $2 trillion coronavirus relief measure in its current form twice in 24 hours, negotiations between Senate leadership and the White House continue behind closed doors,\\n\\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left, accompanied by White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, walks to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., March 24, 2020.

The new point-of-care test, having just received an emergency-use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will be able to deliver results in as little as five minutes, according to the manufacturer.\\n\\nThis test from medical device company Abbott, which begins shipping April 1, may soon be available at your local urgent care clinic.\\n\\n\"This is going to be the fastest molecular point-of-care test to date,\" said John Frels, Ph.D., Abbott’s vice president of research and development, in an interview with ABC News. \"It generates a positive result in 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.\"\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump called the test “a whole new ballgame” and in a recent tweet, Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, echoed these sentiments calling it \"a game changer.\" During Monday\\'s White House briefing, Trump brought the machine that will run the new COVID-19 test to the Rose Garden for a show-and-tell, calling the new rapid test \"highly accurate.\"\\n\\nThe test will run on the company’s existing ID NOW platform, a lightweight, portable machine around the size of a small toaster, which according to Abbott, is already the most widely available molecular point-of-care testing platform in the United States today and is used for illnesses like flu and strep. As a highly mobile platform, it can be used in a variety of healthcare settings, particularly physician offices and urgent care-type settings.\\n\\nAccording to Frels, “what it\\'s really going to be able to do is fill the void, which is rapid results where they’re needed for patients who need them the most.” Until this point, testing has been a fraught process in the U.S. -- with tests at first very difficult to come by and then results taking days. Testing has dramatically expanded since then, but results still take time.\\n\\nThe ID NOW machine can test samples one at a time. A health care provider would use a swab to take a sample from a sick patient\\'s nose or throat and then mix the swab into a chemical solution that breaks open the virus and releases its genetic material. The sample is then placed into the ID NOW instrument, which uses a special “isothermal technology\" to replicate and amplify, if present in the sample, the small section of the virus’ genetic sequences in order to quickly detect whether a person is positive or negative for COVID-19, according to Frels.\\n\\nFrels said that such a test will allow frontline health care workers to see a patient, quickly diagnose them and make immediate decisions regarding treatment and care, helping prevent further transmission of the virus to other people. \"Diagnostics in general, stepping back from this, play into about 70% of therapeutic directional decisions. It’s difficult to know where to go unless you have a test result in front of you,” Frels said.\\n\\nAccording to Adm. Brett Giror, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, there are about “18,000 of these little toaster-sized machines” across doctor’s offices and hospitals across the country. The company does not expect all 18,000 machines to run the test. Abbott will initially supply 50,000 tests a day, with the goal to ramp up test supply to over a million a month. According to the company, the cost of the test is expected to be comparable to the ID NOW flu test and will be covered by most insurance plans.\\n\\n\"This will fill a great need that is not being well served at this point,” said Frels.\\n\\nWith the ID NOW machines already widely available across the country, the infrastructure is already in place to allow for a smooth integration of the rapid COVID-19 test into the health care sphere, which may help speed up and broaden testing and more effectively curb the pandemic. Abbott is working with the White House to deploy the first batches of tests to urgent care clinics, doctors’ offices, and emergency rooms in areas that are hardest hit.\\n\\nFrels says that this test will \"complement the other side of the equation,” referring to high volume, high throughput style COVID-19 diagnostic instruments, such as Abbott’s m2000 Real Time system, which received emergency use approval from the FDA last week. That system, which uses a standard molecular detection technology called PCR to detect COVID-19\\'s genetic sequence in a sample, may take a number of hours to produce results, but can process more samples simultaneously (about 470 tests a day), making it suitable for large hospital settings with multiple patients who require testing.\\n\\nAlthough the test has the potential to address the country’s testing shortage, healthcare workers still need personal protective equipment to protect themselves when administering these tests. This equipment, like masks, eye protection, and gowns, are still in short supply.\\n\\nWhat to know about Coronavirus:\\n\\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: Coronavirus explained\\n\\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: Coronavirus symptoms\\n\\nTracking the spread in the US and Worldwide: Coronavirus map', 'As nursing homes take a heavy toll early, companies try to erect barriers to coronavirus To protect nursing homes from coronavirus, new walls and a close eye.\\n\\nAs officials at the nation\\'s nursing homes began to realize their facilities and elderly populations were deeply vulnerable targets for the spread of novel coronavirus, the medical director at one of the largest chains realized he needed a new playbook to take on an outbreak this dangerous.\\n\\n\"We were determined to do our best to contain it,\" said Dr. Mark Gloth, chief medical officer for HCR ManorCare. \"I said, \\'Why can\\'t we MacGyver it and put something together that will actually provide an additional level of support for our patients and employees?\\'\"\\n\\nThe resulting plan, now implemented in 15 of the chain\\'s 168 nursing homes and planned for 25 by next week, involves walling off a section of each home with heavy-grade plastic to serve as make-shift isolation units. Staff has quickly set apart residents who have a temperature, cough, or other symptoms of the virus. ManorCare officials did confirm they have positive cases of coronavirus in their system, but declined to provide details.\\n\\nThe isolation pods are just one new approach in a patchwork of improvised efforts some nursing homes are instituting to protect one of the most vulnerable populations to the outbreak, as equipment shortages threaten to make finding solutions even more imperative.\\n\\n\"We\\'re doing a lot of things, and we\\'re being very creative in trying to meet regulations to keep the residents safe and also ensure that we prevent COVID-19 in our organization,\" said Keith Myers, President and CEO of MorseLife, one of the largest senior care facilities in Florida, with more than 800 residents. \"It\\'s very challenging.\"\\n\\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\\n\\nAlready, seniors in institutional settings have proven to be tragically susceptible to the highly contagious illness. When the outbreak struck a nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, in late February, it spread to 129 people, killing 35. Loss of life has followed at nursing homes in Georgia, Illinois and Florida.\\n\\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis lashed out publicly at one facility in his state last week, after coronavirus infected 10 residents, killing three of them. DeSantis accused the Atria Willow Wood home of failing to screen staff, cooks and construction workers prior to letting them enter.\\n\\nThe nursing home system is doing what it can to conserve vital protective equipment, like masks and gowns. HRC ManorCare\\n\\n\"It clearly fell below the standard of care, and whether it went into criminal ... I think that that\\'s a possibility,\" DeSantis said during a press conference.\\n\\nThe company that runs the home, Atria Senior Living, called DeSantis\\'s remarks \"an inaccurate description of many steps we have taken to protect the health and safety of our residents. Beginning March 4, we have been actively screening all visitors and prohibiting anyone from working in the community if he or she is unable to pass our screening, well before any state guidance on this was provided.\"\\n\\nThis week, the entire population of a New Jersey nursing home had to be transferred to another facility when coronavirus swept through, infecting residents and caretakers and leaving the original location short-staffed, New Jersey Department of Health officials said Wednesday.\\n\\nTo date, 147 nursing homes across 27 states have reported at least one resident with COVID-19, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control.\\n\\nFor many companies that run the nearly 16,000 nursing homes in the U.S., though, this has been a time to rally around each other in search of solutions, Gloth said.\\n\\n\"We\\'re all in it together,\" Gloth said. \"Everybody\\'s intentions are really solid here.\"\\n\\nThe first step many nursing homes took, he said, was to shut down access to outsiders, including family members – a painful decision because it further isolated residents, but one he credited for slowing the assault of the virus.\\n\\nOfficials at MorseLife, a large not-for-profit senior care facility in West Palm Beach, took that step three weeks ago, shutting down the sprawling campus to visitors and volunteers, and canceling activities from the outside.\\n\\nCarmen Shell, who oversees the skilled nursing home and long-term care center as the Senior Vice President of the MorseLife Health Center, says MorseLife now takes the temperature of all staff when they initially enter the building and twice throughout their shift. Additionally, they take a complete set of vital signs for all of the long-term care residents daily and document observations on any respiratory symptoms every shift. For short-term residents, their vitals are taken every shift. New patients are monitored every hour for the first three days. So far, MorseLife says it is not aware of a confirmed case of coronavirus in its facilities.\\n\\nManorCare began installing the plastic walls after the elderly were shown to be especially vulnerable to the coronavirus. HRC ManorCare\\n\\nWhen Florida officials announced they were further tightening restrictions statewide, assisted care facilities like MorseLife had to get creative. They didn\\'t have enough protective gear on hand to comply with new rules requiring that all staff needed facial masks, so they are buying ultraviolet lights to disinfect the supply they had on hand and have started to use what Shell called \"alternate face masks.\"\\n\\nShe said some employees are using scarves, while others \"are actually making, sewing cloth masks that can be reused until our inventory gets up because of the number of residents that we care for and the number of staff members, we have a very high burn rate. And right now we don\\'t have sufficient masks to give everyone else.\"\\n\\nThese are measures that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called \"a last resort,\" and says that the ability of scarves or bandannas to protect healthcare providers is \"unknown.\"\\n\\nGloth said ManorCare has audited the supplies across the country and right now has enough masks and gowns. But as numbers of positive coronavirus tests have crept up in certain markets, he said he knows the supplies could start to thin.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been very careful looking at our resources,\" he said. \"We have a finite number of tools… [But] I never ever ever want to say no to a request for resources.

Larry Hogan issued an order banning the gathering of more than 50 people, police told ABC News that if the situation warrants, they will take the “the appropriate action” to control crowds.\\n\\n“Maryland State Police response to a complaint will be prompt and appropriate,” Col. Woodrow Jones III, the agency\\'s superintendent, said in a statement. “Depending on the call and location, we will first make contact with the owner or manager of the establishment. If voluntary compliance does not occur, we will take enforcement action, in cooperation with the local state’s attorney. That could result in the issuance of a criminal summons or warrant, or it could result in immediate arrest, depending on the circumstances in the particular situation,.”\\n\\nJones said that a violation of the governor’s executive order could be punishable by one year in jail or a $5,000 fine.\\n\\nABC News\\' Aaron Katersky and Josh Margolin contributed to this report.', 'Seeking place to blame, Trump uses term for COVID-19 that advocacy groups say is connected to anti-Asian bias There have been dozens of bias incidents against Asian Americans, groups say.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump attempted to focus blame for the spread of the novel coronavirus onto China this week by using a name for the virus that advocacy groups say has been associated with dozens of bias incidents against Asian Americans.\\n\\nThe president in a tweet on Monday started calling COVID-19 the \"China Virus,\" repeating the term on Twitter and to reporters over the next two days.\\n\\nHe said he started using the phrase to counter Chinese misinformation that the U.S. military initially spread the virus, a conspiracy theory not borne out by evidence.\\n\\n\"China was putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them, that was false,\" Trump said at a press conference on Tuesday. \"And rather than having an argument, I said I have to call it where it came from.

Andrew Cuomo delivered words of confidence to residents.\\n\\n\"This isn\\'t our first rodeo,\" Cuomo said at a March 2 press conference. \"We are fully coordinated, and we are fully mobilized, and we are fully prepared to deal with the situation as it develops.\"\\n\\nThe governor, however, struck a much different tone, perhaps his most sobering yet, during a press conference on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"We underestimated this virus. It\\'s more powerful. It\\'s more dangerous than we expected,\" Cuomo said, warning there is no end in sight.\\n\\nThere are at least 93,000 diagnosed coronavirus cases in New York, with more than 2,000 deaths reported, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nThe same day Cuomo, who has been praised by some for his response, made his remarks, President Donald Trump and his administration addressed the nation and called New York\\'s response \"a very late start.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s a comparison of how New York and the Trump administration responded to the pandemic during the month of March.\\n\\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks to the media at the Javits Convention Center, which is being turned into a hospital to help fight coronavirus cases, March 24, 2020, in New York City. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images\\n\\nMarch 1\\n\\nCuomo announced New York\\'s first confirmed coronavirus patient: a woman in her late 30s believed to have contracted the virus in Iran.\\n\\n\"There is no cause for surprise -- this was expected. As I said from the beginning, it was a matter of when, not if there would be a positive case of novel coronavirus in New York,\" Cuomo said.\\n\\nHe assured New Yorkers that the general risk in the state \"remains low.\"\\n\\nThe message was along the lines of what other state leaders were telling residents and what the U.S. surgeon general was telling the public.\\n\\n\"#COVID19 is a serious disease, but for the general public the immediate health risk is considered low,\" Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted.\\n\\nMarch 2\\n\\nCuomo announced that the Wadsworth Center, a public health laboratory within the State Department of Health in Albany, was partnering with hospitals to expand testing capacity to 1,000 tests per day.\\n\\nThe governor also said a new cleaning protocol was being introduced in schools and for public transportation to help contain any spread.\\n\\nThe same day, Trump criticized Democrats, saying \"they are fearmongering\" and had criticized him when he \"closed the country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s travel restrictions to and from China went into effect on Feb. 2. They were not a ban.\\n\\nMarch 3\\n\\nCuomo reported the state\\'s second confirmed case, along with measures to better equip New York to handle potential spread.\\n\\nHe signed a $40 million emergency management authorization to bring in additional staffing and equipment. Cuomo also amended his Paid Sick Leave budget to safeguard employees who had to stay home from work to isolate or quarantine.\\n\\nTrump at the time said that the U.S. was monitoring other countries that had been badly affected to see if more stringent measures were necessary to prevent a major outbreak in the U.S.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence, who\\'s chairing the White House Coronavirus Task Force, later said that about 2,500 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-approved testing kits would be sent out by the end of the week.\\n\\nMarch 4\\n\\nConfirmed cases began to slowly rise in New York, with Cuomo reporting a total of 11, up from two from the day before.\\n\\nA major point of concern at the time were cases in Westchester County, which stemmed from a 50-year-old attorney who tested positive. Three members of the man\\'s family tested positive -- his wife, son and daughter -- as well as a neighbor who drove him to the hospital, according to Cuomo, who warned that the number of cases in that county would reach \"dozens and dozens and dozens.\"\\n\\nAbout 1,000 were asked to self-quarantine in Westchester. More measures were enacted, including temporary closures of some schools and a synagogue.\\n\\nTrump similarly announced more measures, saying there would be health screening checks for passengers entering the U.S. from certain countries where coronavirus is prevalent. He had previously said that there were screening checks prior to departure for people from on direct flights from South Korea and Italy.\\n\\nThe president also incorrectly blamed a delay in testing on the Obama administration.\\n\\nMarch 5\\n\\nConfirmed cases in New York rose to 22, according to Cuomo, with most in Westchester County.\\n\\nCuomo urged New Yorkers to remain vigilant.\\n\\n\"Luckily in this country, and certainly in this state, we have the most sophisticated health care system probably on the globe. So, we\\'re coordinated, we\\'re on top of it, we\\'re diligent. But we also have to keep it all in focus,\" he said.\\n\\nTrump meanwhile spoke out against criticism of comments he made to Sean Hannity in which the president said some people with mild cases of coronavirus could go back to work.\\n\\n\"I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC,\" Trump tweeted. \"Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly, only looking to do harm to the incredible & successful effort being made!\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s comment to Hannity was: \"So if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better, just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work, some of them go to work, but they get better.\" Trump noted that he was speaking based on a hunch.\\n\\nMarch 6\\n\\nNew York cases jumped from the morning to the afternoon, with Cuomo reporting 33 and then 44, most still in Westchester County.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not urging calm. I\\'m urging reality,\" he said. \"I\\'m urging a factual response as opposed to an emotional response.\"\\n\\nTrump visited the CDC in Atlanta and caused confusion when he said, \"Anyone who wants a test can get a test.\"\\n\\nPence later clarified Trump\\'s comment: \"The president\\'s exactly right that for the state laboratories, for the communities that have been impacted, that have concerns about the coronavirus, we have been able to respond to requests for tests,\" Pence said.\\n\\nMarch 7\\n\\nA state of emergency was declared in New York after total confirmed cases rose to 76 and reached 89 later in the day.\\n\\nCuomo said the declaration allowed for the government to help local health departments that \"are very stressed.\"\\n\\nMarch 8\\n\\nThe total number of confirmed cases in New York reached 105, and Cuomo urged those who could, to work from home.\\n\\nCuomo also criticized the federal government\\'s response, saying, \"We mobilized quickly, but the federal government has been slow off the mark and they continue to be slow. That\\'s unacceptable -- we need them to approve these private labs today so we can stay ahead of this evolving situation.\"\\n\\nTrump pushed back on the criticism.\\n\\n\"We have a perfectly coordinated and fine-tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus,\" he tweeted. \"We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!\"\\n\\nMarch 9\\n\\nNew York reported 142 confirmed cases, according to Cuomo.\\n\\nHe continued to urge the federal government to approve testing in the state. At the time, Northwell Health, the state\\'s largest health care provider, was completing 75 to 80 samples of manual testing per day, but automated testing on thousands of samples per day still lacked federal approval.\\n\\nTrump tweeted fatality rates about the flu, seemingly comparing the two diseases. Health experts have noted that coronavirus is not like the flu.\\n\\n\"So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & economy go on,\" Trump wrote. \"At this moment, there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths. Think about that!\"\\n\\nThat same day, the Trump administration announced it was giving $699,000 to a company that\\'s developing a testing system that could administer 1,000 tests per day, each producing a result in about three hours.\\n\\nMarch 10\\n\\nNew York reported 173 confirmed cases, according to Cuomo.\\n\\nWith the majority still in Westchester County in New Rochelle, Cuomo closed down the schools, houses of worship and large gatherings within a mile radius of the city from March 12 to March 25.\\n\\n\"As the number of positive cases rises, I am urging all New Yorkers to remember the bottom line: We talk about all this stuff to keep the public informed -- not to incite fear -- and if you are not a member of the vulnerable population then there is no reason for excess anxiety,\" Cuomo said.\\n\\nTrump, however, struck a more optimistic tone: \"It hit the world, and we\\'re prepared and we\\'re doing a great job with it, and it will go away, stay calm, it will go away.\"\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House, March 31, 2020, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP, FILE\\n\\nMarch 11\\n\\nConfirmed cases in New York rose to 216, according to Cuomo, who also said the state had contracted 28 private labs to conduct testing.\\n\\n\"We\\'re continuing to prioritize ramping up testing capacity because the more people you identify as having the virus, the better you can contain it,\" Cuomo said.\\n\\nTrump meanwhile acknowledged in a memo an anticipated shortage of respirators.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, at present, public health experts anticipate shortages in the supply of personal respiratory devices (respirators) available for use by health care workers in mitigating further transmission of COVID-19,\" Trump wrote to his secretaries of health and human services and of labor.\\n\\nTrump\\'s campaign also was continuing to hold rallies, despite Dr. Anthony Fauci\\'s earlier recommendation people stay away from large crowds.\\n\\nMarch 12\\n\\nRestrictions in New York increased, with Cuomo announcing that there could be no gatherings of more than 500 people and that any gatherings of fewer than 500 had to reduce capacity by 50%.\\n\\nConfirmed cases hit 325.\\n\\nTrump announced in an address from the Oval Office that he would be \"suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days.\"\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security later clarified that wouldn\\'t apply to U.S. residents and green card holders in Europe. It would only apply to foreign nationals coming from Europe to the U.S., and travel from the U.K. would still be allowed.\\n\\nMarch 13\\n\\nCuomo spoke highly about drive-through testing in New Rochelle, noting that he was prioritizing the city because of the high number of cases there. He also said he anticipated, over the next week, to increase testing to about 6,000 per day from 3,000.\\n\\nConfirmed cases reached 421 in New York.\\n\\nThe same day, Trump declared a national emergency.\\n\\n\"Two very big words,\" he said during a press conference from the Rose Garden.\\n\\nThe president said doing so would open up $50 billion in additional funding to aid states in their efforts to combat the virus. He also said people should only get tested if they have certain symptoms, but he didn\\'t specify which ones.\\n\\n\"It\\'s totally unnecessary. This will pass,\" Trump said.\\n\\nMarch 14\\n\\nThe first two deaths were reported in New York, as confirmed cases climbed to 613.\\n\\n\"Our goal is to slow the spread of the virus to a rate that the health care system can manage, and we\\'re doing that through aggressive testing and strong social distancing protocols,\" Cuomo said.\\n\\nThe governor acknowledged that the anticipated wave of new cases \"threatens to crash our health care system, and we need national action from the federal government to address the quickly evolving situation now,\" such as localizing testing, federalizing shutdowns and tasking the Army Corps of Engineers to expand hospital capacity.\\n\\nTrump later adopted more travel restrictions, extending them to the United Kingdom and Ireland. He also urged Americans not to travel domestically if they didn\\'t have to.\\n\\nMarch 15\\n\\nSchools are ordered to close in New York City, Westchester County and Suffolk County, as statewide confirmed cases reached 729.\\n\\nTrump offered a more optimistic viewpoint in a press briefing, saying, \"There\\'s a very contagious virus, but it\\'s something we have tremendous control over.\"\\n\\nHowever, Fauci later said in the same briefing, \"The worst is ahead for us. How we respond to that challenge, that determines what the ultimate endpoint will be.\"\\n\\nMarch 16\\n\\nCuomo banded together with New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont to announce that the states were limiting crowd capacity for recreational and social gatherings to 50 people. Restaurants and bars were also ordered to close for dining in, but they still could offer takeout or delivery. Movie theaters, gyms and casinos had to close.\\n\\n\"This is not a war that can be won alone, which is why New York is partnering with our neighboring states to implement a uniform standard ...

It will go down in the history books as one of those moments of true crisis and confusion and chaos,\" Cuomo said. \"Everybody is afraid. Everybody is nervous. ...

Debra Foley, the communications director for the home, also did not respond to ABC News for comment.\\n\\nThe superintendent, Bennett Walsh, was placed on paid administrative leave on March 30. Employees have accused him of lying about procedures in place to state officials, while Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse said he did not alert state officials of the first eight deaths.\\n\\n\"I was shocked on the phone call when the superintendent let me know that there had been eight deaths between Wednesday [March 25] and Sunday [March 29] without any public notification, without any notification to my office and also just no notification to the state government that oversees the facility in the first place,\" Morse said in a Facebook Live speech last week.\\n\\nMassachusetts Gov.

Rivera said one example of that is her current paycheck. Her normal net pay is around $1,200, according to pay stubs she shared with ABC News. Yet her paycheck for the week where she was in the hospital amounted to only $518. She had not heard back from human resources despite multiple calls to them as to why her paycheck was lowered.\\n\\nWhen the first veteran who was showing symptoms of coronavirus got tested, both employees said they were not given any protective gear to wear and the masks that were onsite were not handed out.\\n\\nBombredi said he was shocked to learn this and even more shocked to hear that leadership was saying otherwise.\\n\\n\"They were telling everybody, \\'We\\'re following CDC guidelines, everybody\\'s wearing safety equipment.\\' ... Every one of my workers said they\\'re not doing this.

He was exposing those veterans,\" Ramirez said.\\n\\nThe veteran\\'s test eventually came back positive, according to Rivera and Ramirez. Ramirez said he had learned from other staffers that it was a positive test on the evening of March 20. He said he didn\\'t receive an email from management about the positive test until March 22.\\n\\nThe man\\'s roommates were then moved to other units, however, staff said this proved to be ineffective because those roommates had already been exposed at that point.\\n\\n\"They got moved into other bedrooms where other healthy veterans were. These veterans may be infected and now they\\'re infecting others,\" Ramirez said.\\n\\nRamirez and Bombredi also said that when the veterans were moved around, many were put into rooms only meant to hold four. However with the added residents, some rooms held six, according to Ramirez and Bombredi. Other veterans were moved to the dining room, they said.\\n\\nBombredi said staff worried about eventually separating them.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, part of the worst news is that they never had to separate the unit,\" he said. \"So many died that the rooms are now at the correct amount again.\"\\n\\nBombredi said that the home has been understaffed for years. For him, it was not a matter of if, but when, a dire situation would arise and the safety of residents and staff would be thrown into question.\\n\\n\"I keep hearing from everybody how quickly this developed.

However, we cannot stop the outbreak completely and our community will likely remain at risk for months to come. Through my health order and directive today, I am re-emphasizing the requirement for people who are infected with COVID-19 to follow our existing recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to others in the community by staying isolated from others while ill, and to stay quarantined with symptoms while test results are pending. Each of us need to do whatever we can to prevent others from becoming ill.

And quite frankly, thus far has been less about how we campaign or make stark differences between the president and I. I think some are just self-evident, but the bottom line is that...my whole rationality here is to make sure that we focus on the urgent need of the American people,” Biden continued.\\n\\nBiden’s campaign is now navigating how to take the leadership mantle on amid the global crisis, without the power and gravitas that comes with the title of ‘Commander in Chief -- a fact Trump’s election campaign is happy to point out.\\n\\n“The President is leading an unprecedented mobilization of America against the coronavirus and all Joe Biden can offer is ineffective partisan sniping from the sidelines,” Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.\\n\\nFor his part, Biden says he\\'s been dealing with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leaders Chuck Schumer \"regularly,\" amid the crisis, and has connected with some state and local officials as well. The former vice president has also not been shy about his contempt for Trump’s response, excoriating the president for his over-promises to the American people.\\n\\n“President Trump, stop saying false things, will ya? People are worried, they\\'re really frightened. And when these things don\\'t come through you just exacerbate their concerns. Stop saying false things that make you sound like a hero, and start putting the full weight in the federal government behind finding fast, safe and effective treatments,” Biden said Friday.\\n\\nAll of this comes after two days without public events with Biden, and at a natural ‘reset’ point in the race: Biden has earned at least 1,080 of the 1,991 delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination, according to ABC News’ delegate count--effectively ending any viable path to the nomination for Vermont Sen.

Charles Rex Arbogast/AP, FILE\\n\\nWorking behind the scenes\\n\\nThe former vice president has been working from Wilmington, Delaware, spending his time on calls with staff, receiving policy briefings, and connecting with political endorsers and supporters over the past few days, according to Biden and his staff. On a call with reporters Friday afternoon, Biden said he was spending four to five hours on the phone with his economic and medical advisors, and following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) about how to prevent the spread of the virus.\\n\\n“I\\'m having constant telephone conferences. A few staff show up and we\\'re following the CDC guidelines: people are coming in with masks on and wearing gloves and so on,” Biden said of the precautions he and his team are taking as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United State continued to rise.\\n\\nThe campaign’s goal, according to a senior Biden aide, is to not only to provide information for the general public on the virus, but also hold the Trump administration to account and provide the leadership to convince voters to vote for Biden come November.\\n\\nBut as his campaign adjusts their day-to-day operations to accomplish that goal, they are confronting the challenges and their own shortcomings that come with trying to construct a digital campaign operation for a candidate so reliant on in-person interactions.\\n\\nThe campaign learned the challenge in a major way last Friday, when a town hall with Illinois voters faced disastrous technical issues. The campaign didn’t attempt another video message with the vice president until the following Tuesday night when Biden spoke via livestream following three more primary wins, and opted for a town hall by telephone on the eve of the contests.\\n\\nBiden is also facing criticism for being largely absent to the public since Tuesday’s primaries. The former vice president has not been seen or heard by voters directly since his Tuesday night address, leading to the hashtag “#WhereisJoeBiden” to trend on Twitter.\\n\\nSupporters of both Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump have questioned why a presidential campaign arguing for their candidate to hold the highest office in the land is struggling to make him visible to the public in the midst of the crisis.\\n\\nThe Biden campaign declined to respond to the criticisms raised by the hashtag.\\n\\n“The bottom line is that everything from providing better access to where I physically live and be able to broadcast from there, as well as our headquarters is underway. We\\'ve hired a professional team to do that now,” Biden told reporters.\\n\\n“It\\'s a little above my pay-grade, as to how we do that, but that\\'s desperately what we\\'re trying to do because I want to be in daily or at least you know significant contact with the American people and communicate what I would be doing what I think we should be doing and how we should be doing it, but I promise you, that\\'s on the way, hopefully, God willing, by Monday.”\\n\\nA source with knowledge of the campaign said Biden\\'s team is working on scaling up that infrastructure and dealing with the realities of Biden’s Wilmington Home, like the fact that there aren’t particularly high ceilings, which can make lighting a challenge.\\n\\nAnd despite multiple attempts to gain more clarity into the candidate’s plans, the campaign did not provide any detailed information on any upcoming events or the day-to-day activities of the former vice president.\\n\\nCampaigning in a \"brave new world\"\\n\\nAs campaigns adjust to the new normal, they’re also confronting the increasingly clear reality that the challenges presented by running for president in the midst of a global, society-altering pandemic are unprecedented.\\n\\n“There\\'s no playbook for this, we don\\'t have a set procedure for what to do,” said Tim Lim, a Democratic advertising strategist that aided President Barack Obama’s re-election effort and served on the National Finance Committee for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.\\n\\nThe Biden campaign, keenly aware of that new reality, is asking for help in how they craft their strategy in the weeks ahead.\\n\\nRob Flaherty, Biden’s digital director, emailed supporters earlier this week asking for input and ideas on how they can adapt to the “brave new world” of campaigning without the option of in-person events.\\n\\nThe campaign is thinking through ways to capitalize on what they see as Biden’s “superpower,” his ability to connect one-one-one with voters.\\n\\n\"How do we make sure that the VP is engaging with his supporters in this moment? That people are checking in on each other? So we\\'re making sure that part of his day is calling through grassroots supporters and making sure they have a chance to interact with him in that capacity,” Flaherty said in an interview with ABC News.\\n\\nA virtual rope line, enabling Biden to speak with individual voters after events, podcasts, and Google hangouts with medical experts amid the coronavirus crisis are ideas under consideration.\\n\\nAnother example thrown out on a call with volunteers Wednesday night was Michelle Kwan, the campaign’s director of surrogates, might be doing a yoga session with supporters, according to one volunteer on the call.\\n\\nAnother idea they’ve employed via a fundraising email sent Friday: a chance to video chat with the candidate himself.\\n\\nWhile social distancing requires the campaign to branch out in new and interesting way to engage voters -- Flaherty argued that the campaign has always been gearing up to highlight Biden\\'s leadership ahead of the general election, but is now adapting to an entirely different \"battlefield.\"\\n\\n\"That sense of community, driving people to action, interactivity online, being in the places where people are and positioning the VP as the president. And...showing his leadership in these moments -- that was always gonna be what we have to do anyway. It\\'s just that overnight...the whole battlefield sort of shifted online,” Flaherty said.\\n\\n“We\\'re drinking from the fire hose in the best way possible,” he added.\\n\\nThe campaign said while much of their content will focus on the COVID-19 pandemic and displaying Biden’s leadership in the uncertain times, there is still a campaign underway--requiring them to rethink certain elements of outreach already in place.\\n\\n“We\\'re almost even reframing how we think about email to focus on engagements right? How many people are, you know, signing a petition or taking an action versus like how are we getting concrete dollars and so, it\\'s a bit of a reframing of the program to just think about that level of engagement and depth with our supporters as well as the wide reach that we\\'re trying to get,” Flaherty said.\\n\\nWhatever the method, the campaign’s digital infrastructure and strategy has now become paramount to its success.\\n\\n“Your digital strategist has become the most important person in the room,” Lim said. “If you\\'re not listening to that person then you\\'re not gonna be able to move your campaign forward.”\\n\\nThe Bernie Sanders factor\\n\\nWhile Biden and his team work to put the infrastructure and campaign strategy in place to cement their role as Trump’s counterpoint amid the crisis, there is one other unknown for the campaign: Sanders and his plans for the future of his candidacy.\\n\\nWhile Biden’s team has said they don’t see any viable path forward for the Vermont senator, the campaign said they are not calling on Sanders to leave the race, telling volunteers they will continue to demonstrate that the Sanders\\' team deserves time to make that personal decision on their Wednesday call.\\n\\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls former Vice President Joe Biden , left, and Sen.

In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable,” Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir wrote in a statement released Wednesday.\\n\\nBehind the scenes, the campaigns are talking--but focusing on the response to the coronavirus and its impact on their respective campaign.\\n\\n“Since last week, the Biden and Sanders campaigns have been in regular contact at a senior level to discuss how the coronavirus is affecting the campaigns, how to adjust schedules and activities in light of that – as well as to discuss both Vice President Biden’s and Senator Sanders’ ideas on policy responses to the virus,” Biden’s Deputy Campaign Manager and Communication’s Director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement Thursday.\\n\\nForging ahead\\n\\nAs more states postpone their primary contests, the impacts COVID-19, what the campaign looks like from here and Sanders’ continuation in the race raise questions for the larger Democratic Party.\\n\\n“Typically, a campaign would start thinking about the general election which means setting up a joint committee with the DNC and the State Parties. Historically, fundraising for a joint committee is quite reliant on in-person events,” said Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark and a top Biden fundraiser.\\n\\nBiden struggled early and often in the campaign to maintain the fundraising pace of some of his top 2020 rivals, and now faces an incumbent GOP president and a Republican National Committee (RNC) that has been stockpiling cash since Trump’s inauguration.\\n\\nWhile his fundraising has rebounded in recent weeks, fueled by his string of primary victories, back in October, Biden’s campaign burned through significantly more cash than it took in, leaving him with a fraction of the money some of his better-funded rivals had at the time.\\n\\nAt the time of its last filing the Trump campaign, which has enjoyed the ability to jointly raise money with the RNC, reported having over $94 million cash on hand, setting up a lopsided fundraising deficit with whatever Democrat he faces.\\n\\n“My concern right now would be two-fold: one, If the public health crisis remains in place for months and events cannot be part of the equation, all campaigns will have to adjust. It’s of course doable but will be harder considering the amount of money that needs to be raised in order to defeat Trump in November,\" Giffords said.\\n\\n“Two, If Bernie stays in the race and the primary continues, it is more difficult for Biden to pivot to the general election. We have some time still but the more we have the better.

When her breathing labored and her chest hurt, she became more convinced that these were the symptoms virus patients were consistently describing.\\n\\nBut then she was tested. The result: negative. Her doctor, she said, was “stunned.” Netter, a former ABC News producer, and her doctor remain unconvinced.\\n\\n“You know, your symptoms match perfectly,” she said her doctor told her. “It could just be a random virus. But I'm pretty well versed in upper respiratory illnesses, and I have never had anything that felt like this.”\\n\\nMedical experts say all evidence suggest the coronavirus tests becoming steadily more available are reliable. But as with any medical test, the coronavirus test cannot be expected to be accurate 100% of the time, so they still advise that people who test negative, if their symptoms are consistent with those of COVID-19, should consider getting re-tested and continue to quarantine until asymptomatic.\\n\\nThe are several tests for COVID-19 that are being used in labs across the country. Each of them looks for specific genetic material from the virus. If that unique genetic material is on the swab, the test reads positive. If the test does not find viral evidence on the swab, though, the test will read negative, even – in some cases – when the person might be infected.\\n\\nMedical staff of a mobile unit take samples from a woman to test for Covid-19, at the Santa Maria della Pieta' hospital complex, in Rome, April 1, 2020. Cecilia Fabiano/AP\\n\\nThe tests will “never be perfect,” said Dr. Angela Caliendo, an infectious disease expert at Brown University’s medical school. “You're going to miss people, particularly … early in disease with not a great specimen.”\\n\\nIt is too soon to know how many tests are producing false negatives. Molecular tests for viruses like the ones commonly being used for COVID-19 generally have very high sensitivities. According to the CDC, the same kinds of tests used for flu have a sensitivity in the range of 90-95%.\\n\\nRoche, one of the largest manufacturers of tests, told ABC News that their coronavirus tests have a similarly high sensitivity of 95%, meaning that the tests could miss about 5% of infected people.\\n\\nOthers did not provide ABC News with a figure. Quest, for example, another major manufacturer, told ABC News that because the tests were approved by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization, “these FDA EUA assays have not been clinically validated. Hence there are no clinical sensitivity and specificity data for any of the FDA EUA assays.”\\n\\nBut Harlan Krumholz, a professor of medicine at Yale and director of the Yale New Haven Hospital Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, has warned that the problem could be much bigger than that.\\n\\n“Unfortunately, we have very little public data on the false-negative rate for these tests in clinical practice,” Krumholz wrote in The New York Times on Wednesday. “Research coming out of China indicates that the false-negative rate may be around 30 percent. Some of my colleagues, experts in laboratory medicine, express concerns the false-negative rate in this country could be even higher.”\\n\\nMedical staff of a mobile unit take samples to test for Covid-19, at the Santa Maria della Pieta' hospital complex, in Rome, April 1, 2020. Cecilia Fabiano/AP\\n\\nWhile a positive reading is almost always reliable, said Dr. Mark Abdelmalek, false negatives can surface in cases where the test is administered incorrectly, or the sample is mishandled on the way to the lab.\\n\\n“All tests have a chance of false negatives,” said Abdelmalek, an ABC News medical contributor. “It’s not that this test is faulty.”\\n\\nThere are a few scenarios, Abdelmalek explained, that can skew test results.\\n\\nFaulty Collection: The preferred swab is from the back of the nose. Samples from the back of the throat or the nostrils are sometimes taken, but those could increase the chance of a negative test even if a person is infected.\\n\\nBad timing: If the test was conducted too early or too late, virus may not be detected. Swabs collected too early may not capture enough virus for a test to pick-up the virus particles. And if they are sampled too late, virus levels may have begun to subside, leaving too little of the virus to be detected.\\n\\nMishandling: Given the crush of tests being collected, samples that are not stored properly – refrigerated immediately, and frozen if they are held longer than 72 hours – can degrade before they are tested.\\n\\nEmployees in protective clothing carry out tests for the coronavirus at a laboratory in Berlin, March 26, 2020. Axel Schmidt/Reuters, FILE\\n\\n“Every test has a limit of sensitivities,” said Dr. Alan Wells, a professor of Pathology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. “You can’t expect of every virus that if you have very, very low levels of virus, that I can find it because it's not there to be seen.”\\n\\n“I know it's disconcerting for families and the public to hear that you can't find anything, but this is nothing that's different from any flu season where there are some respiratory pneumonia, pneumonias that tend to not be explained,” Wells told ABC News. “That's not as bad as it sounds. And the reason it's not as bad as it sounds is the treatment for most of these patients…is the same.”\\n\\nWhile the idea of potentially suffering from COVID-19 but not testing positive for it sounds alarming, medical experts said it doesn’t need to be. Given the symptoms Netter was facing, for example, she said her doctors advised a course of treatment no different than the one for coronavirus.\\n\\n“I'm still quarantined,” she said. “I'm going to wait until I'm 100 percent asymptomatic … [and] not going anywhere.

Now, Trump is back to offering niceties.\\n\\nThe diverging messages have generated finger-pointing by both Beijing and Washington that is further destabilizing a critical relationship between countries with the two largest economies and militaries.\\n\\nThere might not be radical shifts in U.S.-China policy during the next several months, but China\\'s cover-up and disinformation campaign will color the relationship going forward, Dan Blumenthal, director of Asian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said Wednesday.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very hard to see progress on trade talks after this,\" he said. He added that he expects Congress will push to address American dependence on China for medical and other manufacturing supplies.\\n\\nThere are calls in Congress to hold China accountable for initially covering up the outbreak. Anticipating a backlash, China\\'s official Xinhua News Agency last month suggested that Beijing could retaliate against the U.S. by banning the export of medical products that would leave the U.S. stuck in the ”ocean of viruses.\"\\n\\nEarly in the outbreak, Trump lauded China for its response to COVID-19, tweeting on Jan. 24 that the U.S. appreciated Beijing\\'s efforts and “transparency,\" even though local Chinese officials initially covered up mounting cases in Wuhan, the city where the virus was first reported. In February, as the virus began to spread in Europe, Trump still refrained from blaming China.\\n\\nThen Trump started going after Beijing, repeatedly calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus.\" He said he was upset that some Chinese officials had suggested without evidence that the U.S. military transported the virus to Wuhan or that the virus was released from a U.S. lab.\\n\\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, tweeted March 12: “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!”\\n\\nOther U.S. officials chimed in. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called COVID-19 the “Wuhan virus” six times in one State Department briefing. He chastised the Chinese Communist Party for not allowing U.S. medical experts into the country, kicking Western journalists out and cracking down on the flow of information.\\n\\nThe National Security Council at the White House also has accused the Communist Party of launching disinformation campaigns around the world and retaliating against Chinese citizens who wanted to tell the public about the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe president has said China was trying to blame the United States to distract the world from the shortcomings of Beijing\\'s own response.\\n\\n“It could have been stopped in its tracks,” Trump said March 19 at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House. “Unfortunately, they (Chinese officials) didn’t decide to make it public. But the whole world is suffering because of it.”\\n\\nTrump abruptly stopped calling it the “Chinese virus” shortly after China’s ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, appeared to split with Zhao, calling the theory “crazy” and saying that it was not for diplomats to speculate.\\n\\nNow the president is praising Chinese President Xi Jinping again.\\n\\n“We have a great trade deal and we would like to keep it. They would like to keep it and the relationship is good,” Trump said Wednesday. He noted that some of China\\'s numbers on COVID-19 cases seem a bit “low,” but he insisted his relationship with Xi remained “really good.”\\n\\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The coronavirus has infected at least 940,000 people and killed more than 47,000 worldwide, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nRay Yip, an American public health official who founded the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s office in China in 2003, said expert teams the central government sent to Wuhan failed to initially realize that the virus could spread from human to human, which compounded the consequences.\\n\\nOnce the Chinese government understood the scope of the problem, it moved decisively, he said. Chinese health officials informed the World Health Organization about the new virus on Dec. 31. By Jan. 12, Chinese scientists had sequenced the virus’ genetic makeup and shared it with the WHO, drawing praise for their transparency and swift action.\\n\\nYip contends the U.S. response was far worse than China\\'s.\\n\\n“If we started responding forcibly, properly, tracked down the cases and snuffed them out, it didn’t have to spread,” Yip said. \"We let an initial small fire spread, and now the fire is too big — we have trouble putting it out. If there is such a thing as suing for malpractice for public health — this has to be it.\"\\n\\nDali Yang, a University of Chicago political science professor who researches Chinese governance and has closely followed the pandemic, also points a finger at local Chinese officials, who, in early January, were preparing for \"two sessions,\" an annual event for local and provincial officials.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t want to upset Beijing or cause panic in the streets ahead of the important Jan. 11-17 meetings so they suppressed information about the outbreak.\\n\\nBefore and during the \"two sessions,\" China’s National Health Commission dispatched three teams of experts to Wuhan. The first two struggled to get information from local health officials, especially about whether the virus was being transmitted from person to person, Yang said. The experts reportedly were closely watched and were not allowed to talk to emergency doctors or visit infectious-disease wards.\\n\\nLocal officials punished Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist who shared information about local transmission of the virus, which later claimed his life. When Dr. Ai Fen, head of emergency care at Wuhan Central Hospital, assessed that the virus was being spread from human to human, she was admonished for spreading rumors and causing panic, Yang said.\\n\\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Beijing often blames local authorities for the central government\\'s failings.\\n\\n“They\\'re still covering up,” Blumenthal said. “All discussion of COVID-19 on social media apps get blocked and censured. ...

The virus then gets into sewage water through infected stool, giving scientists an indirect way to tell if the virus is present.\\n\\nThis is not the first time this type of technology has been used to track diseases in communities. In 2013, a polio outbreak was detected in Israel through sewage water testing, prompting a polio vaccination campaign to help stop the outbreak from becoming an epidemic.\\n\\nNow, at least two independent research teams in the United States are developing technology to measure how much COVID-19 is in sewage water to help track virus spread.\\n\\nOne of those teams is led by Dr. Ian Pepper, director of the University of Arizona Water and Energy Sustainable Technology (WEST) Center. Dr. Pepper said the technology involves taking a sample of sewage water back to the lab, then using a molecular test called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to test the water for COVID-19. If the water tests positive, more tests are run, including attempting to grow the virus to see if it is still active. PCR is also used for the current COVID-19 nasal swab test.\\n\\nUltimately, this technology detects if the virus DNA is in the sewage water, and how much. Dr. Pepper explained even though virus DNA can only survive in water for a limited time, even after it is inactive the DNA is still in the water.\\n\\nNewsha Ghaeli is president and co-founder of BioBot, a startup spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Mass.

Those who operate these transportation services are also vulnerable to exposure to COVID-19.\\n\\nLast month, Detroit bus driver Jason Hargrove became ill with the virus a few days after posting a video on Facebook in which he fumed about a woman who he said stood on his bus and coughed without covering her mouth.\\n\\n“We out here as public workers doing our jobs, trying to make an honest living to take care of our families. But for you to get on the bus and stand on the bus and cough several times without covering your mouth … that lets me know that some folks don’t care,” Hargrove said in the eight-minute video.\\n\\nHargrove, a father of six, died a week later. It’s unclear how he contracted the virus.\\n\\nJason Hargrove is seen in a screen grab from a video he posted on his Facebook page. Jason Djinfiniti Hargrove/Facebook\\n\\nHis wife, Desha Johnson-Hargrove, said that he feared going in to work every day.\\n\\n“When he came home, he was so distressed. He got out of his clothes. You know, it just bothered him so bad,” Johnson-Hargrove said. “He just kept saying, ‘Baby, I’m so mad.’ And I just kept trying to calm him down and I’m just like, ‘It’s going to be OK.’”\\n\\nOne funeral home in Brooklyn, New York, has been inundated by families seeking their services. The staff at the Scarpaci Funeral Home said they are tending to 17 bodies, according to the funeral home’s manager, Anthony Pennachio.\\n\\n\"That\\'s usually a whole month\\'s worth of work,\" Pennachio said. \"Now that\\'s only four days.\"\\n\\nAnthony Pennachio, manager at the Scarpaci Funeral Home in Brooklyn, New York, where he says they\\'re working on as many people who\\'ve died as they would normally see in a month. ABC News\\n\\nThe funeral home has had to change a lot of its policies due to the virus, including limiting the number of people who can come to viewings and reducing the amount of time for viewing. If the person died from COVID-19, their family can only get a closed-casket viewing.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not making any in-person arrangements anymore, so my cousins will meet them on a FaceTime phone call or a Zoom [meeting],\" Pennachio said. \"We have to send them pictures -- things we never did before. Physical photographs of the casket was sent to people\\'s smartphones in order to make the casket selection.\"\\n\\nThe staff says they are running out of gloves, gowns and masks. Pennachio said they’re also running out of space, and they’ve resorted to turning one of their viewing chapels into a storage facility for pending cremations and burials.\\n\\n“I feel bad for our families that they can’t mourn their loved ones like they should,” said Celeste Hurta, Pennachio’s cousin and a cosmetologist at the funeral home. \"It breaks my heart.\"\\n\\nCeleste Hurta, a cosmetologist at her family\\'s Scarpaci Funeral Home in Brooklyn, New York, said she feels bad that families \"can\\'t mourn their loved ones like they should\" due to protocols they must now follow. ABC News\\n\\nHurta, who was diagnosed with breast cancer a month ago and had to postpone her surgery due to the pandemic, said as many as 70% of the bodies coming into the funeral home are COVID-19 patients.\\n\\nStill, Hurta said she won’t stop working for the families seeking her funeral home’s help.\\n\\n“I don’t consider taking a break, even though they keep telling me to take a break. I can’t. I can’t. I won’t take a break,” she said.\\n\\nHer dedication to continue working is one echoed by other essential workers facing this invisible enemy to make a living. Latisha Knight hopes that when the pandemic is over, she and other essential workers like her remain seen.\\n\\n\"We are all family, we are all a team. We\\'re all working together to benefit everyone,\" Knight said. \"We need to thank each other more. We need to make sure that we continue to show gratitude and appreciation towards one another, not just during this time but afterwards.\"', 'Tuan Ngo seemed to be at a dead end this weekend as he tried to apply for emergency loans for his nail salon business in Washington state, which has been shuttered since the novel coroanvirus pandemic struck and social distancing measures were implemented to stop the spread.\\n\\nLike so many small-business owners across the country, Ngo was having a hard time navigating the complicated application process that went live late last week and instantly overwhelmed servers and many local banks.\\n\\n\"Paperwork on top of paperwork on top of paperwork,” he told ABC News recently. “The banks say they were not ready. The banks send you on to the [government] website, and you go on the website, they send you back to the bank. So, I don\\'t know where I\\'m going right now I have no help.\"\\n\\nHis story was similar to that of more than a dozen local, small businesses across the country that ABC News has surveyed in the last few days. Still Ngo said he was lucky and worried for colleagues and friends that were having an even harder time.\\n\\n“I can read things online, but think about for all the business owners -- think about all the ones you know – who do not have strong English as a second language,” he said. “I went to college… how is everyone else dealing with all of this?”\\n\\nOf the more than 30 million small businesses in the United States, it is estimated that 11 million are owned by racial and ethnic minorities. Statistically, immigrants in the country are more likely to start and own small businesses than non-immigrants and are more likely to hire employees at faster rates than non-immigrants.\\n\\nYet many minority entrepreneurs are facing unique challenges, including language and cultural barriers, gaps in technology and a lack of existing lines of credit as they try to get the help and funds they need now to keep their doors open and their staff on payroll. They also face a banking system that has historically favored white applicants and may default to that pattern in a time of crisis, advocates say.\\n\\nNgo opened La Bella nail salon 13 years ago in Tacoma with his wife and two employees. They now have two locations and 34 employees, though he has had to furlough them all during this tough time. “They are struggling,” Ngo continued. Almost all of his staff are Vietnamese immigrants, like himself, some of them have limited English language skills. “My employees and their families are trying survive. I have a lot of single moms with no other income and it is really hard for them to get help.”\\n\\nMarcos Rivera has followed in his father’s footsteps and owns his own Latin-inspired restaurant in the Chicago area, Libertad. Rivera told ABC News that his father was an immigrant from Mexico, who started as a dishwasher and eventually owned a few restaurants of his own. The restaurants were family affairs, with all of the children helping out.\\n\\nRivera said he has laid off 13 employees so far, but has a small team that has stayed on to help with some takeout orders during this period of social distancing. He said the process of applying for loans has been overwhelming. For instance, he said he did not receive confirmation over the weekend that his applications went through and has not had loans and lines of credit with his bank in the past.\\n\\nHe agreed that for business owners without dominant English skills, the process would have been even more difficult. For “mom and pop places it is going to be really difficult.. if you don’t speak the language well enough, if you’re not savvy with everything it is going to be very different for them to do,\" he said. \"They are going to need people to help get them through it.”\\n\\nThe latest documents and resources from the federal government about how small businesses can apply for various loans and grants available during this crisis have only been provided in English, with some limited Spanish translation.\\n\\n“The federal government is trying to do a lot in a very small amount of time, so I would not fault them entirely. They are trying to deploy the capital quickly and that means you don’t have time to run all the materials through every language, but that has created a vacuum that we and others are trying to fill,” Lamar Heystek, president of the non-profit minority business advocacy group ASIAN, Inc. told ABC News.\\n\\nHeystek said his group has been inundated with calls from all around the country from people looking for assistance in navigating online portals and paperwork that are in English only. He was grateful some people have volunteered to help businesses through this process, but they are working overtime to translate, produce and get materials out in different languages so people can get information they need.\\n\\nIn addition to the language barriers, many of the smallest businesses in the country have not previously enjoyed loans, lines of credit or personal relationships with their banks. As such, in this moment, many have of found it difficult to have their applications for emergency loans prioritized.\\n\\nHeystek called it a “vicious Catch-22,” and on a call with reporters Tuesday, members of the Congressional Black Congress also expressed concern over the issue.\\n\\nThe CBC pointed to a “history and legacy” of racial inequality in banking and credit systems, which they see hurting minority businesses owners in this case. In short, white business owners have been more likely to receive credit in the past, and now, in a moment of crisis, as banks default to lending to their familiar customers, minority-owned small businesses could once again be denied and excluded at disproportionate rates.\\n\\n“There are built-in disadvantages,” Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, D- Mass., said on the call. She argued the lending preferences of banks and step up that some larger firms had in the process was hurting businesses that are “too small to fail,” like barber shops and dry cleaners.\\n\\n“Our nation’s response was effective if you have a multi-million dollar business, if you are Boeing or United Airlines. We are worried these benefits are not trickling down to our communities,” Congresswoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., said. “We need to fix it in the next bill.”\\n\\nThe Department of Treasury signaled Tuesday that it was working to expand the amount of funds available to small businesses through some of the emergency lending programs. Still, such a wide range of small businesses competing for this emergency capital, there is great anxiety among owners of very small businesses that they might get overlooked.\\n\\nRight now, businesses with fewer than 500 employees can apply for the Payroll Protection Program funds, for example to rehire or keep staff onboard during this pandemic. Those companies on the larger end of that 500-employee scale are much more likely to have accountants, lawyers, and sophisticated software to apply for funds.\\n\\n“They feel betrayed… that there is no longer the possibility of the American dream,” Elizabeth Chung, executive director of the Asian American Center of Frederick, Maryland told ABC News. Her nonprofit helps support and advocate for small businesses and immigrant communities. “These are people who pay taxes, who are law abiding citizens and now all of a sudden are saying, “What about me?”\\n\\n“These small business are the fabric of our communities. I don\\'t have Boeing here. I have my neighborhood store,” she added. Chung said she worried about clients or hers and members of her local community who run cash-only businesses or family-run small firms who have limited bookkeeping.\\n\\nChung herself has struggled to successfully apply for the PPP loans and said she was denied when she attempted. She has kept her staff on payroll, but said she cannot do that much longer. “I\\'ve been in this country for 50 years, and I think this is the first time ever that I felt as much despair.”\\n\\n“We talked about equity. This is not equitable,” she went on. “Just because you\\'re smaller, or you don\\'t have the clout, you don\\'t know where to go, you should not be left behind in this. This is going to hurt the poor even more and that hurts everyone. Economies are built from bottom up.”\\n\\n“This is where the rubber meets the road,” Heystek said echoing this point. “We need these businesses to continue to exist. Those small businesses employ people who spend money locally… If we don’t help these businesses survive, who employ our neighbors, we are hurting ourselves in the end.”\\n\\nWhat to know about Coronavirus:\\n\\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: Coronavirus explained\\n\\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: Coronavirus symptoms\\n\\nTracking the spread in the U.S. and Worldwide: Coronavirus map', 'Everyone in UK must stay home to fight coronavirus, prime minister says More than 372,000 around the world have been diagnosed with the coronavirus.\\n\\nAt least 573 people have now died in the United States from the novel coronavirus -- and officials say the pandemic is accelerating.\\n\\nIn the United States, there are more than 41,700 diagnosed cases of the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, known officially as COVID-19, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nThe coronavirus spans every U.S. state as well as Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, forcing millions of Americans to stay home in an effort to contain the disease.\\n\\nOver 372,000 people around the world have been diagnosed and more than 16,300 people have died across the globe, mostly in Italy and China.\\n\\nMonday\\'s biggest developments:\\n\\nEveryone in UK must stay home\\n\\nThe pandemic is \\'accelerating,\\' WHO director-general says\\n\\nDiagnosed cases soar to over 20,000 in New York\\n\\nAmy Klobuchar\\'s husband tests positive for coronavirus\\n\\nHere\\'s how the news developed Monday.

Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nBut as hard-hit states and hospitals have said they are not getting the supplies they need from the federal government or private companies\\' donation, experts say that elevating the federal response by compelling certain aspects of production could better coordinate the relatively ad-hoc production shifts and donations thus far.\\n\\n\"The private sector is responding with some action here, but it couldn\\'t hurt to have the federal government trying to light a fire under the process,\" Ethan Harris, head of global economics research for Bank of America, told ABC News.\\n\\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\\n\\nThe DPA provides the president with the power to direct civilian businesses to help meet orders for products necessary for the national defense. Congress passed it in 1950 and has since gradually expanded its scope to include homeland security and domestic emergency management.\\n\\nThe act gives the Trump administration the ability to force companies to sign contracts and impose wage and price controls, among other stipulations. In the case of the coronavirus, Trump could compel companies to produce a certain number of ventilators, respirators or other needed medical supplies.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly claimed he has \"invoked\" the act, but in practice, it does not appear his administration has actually used it.\\n\\nOn Tuesday morning, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor said the government planned to use the act for the first time to \"get our hands on\" 60,000 COVID-19 testing kits. Lizzie Kitzow, an agency spokesperson, then said the government was in the end \"able to procure the test kits from the private market\" without using the DPA.\\n\\nGaynor said it would also be used Tuesday to insert language into a contract for masks. FEMA did not respond to ABC News\\' question about whether that actually happened.\\n\\nThe Defense Department, meanwhile, has worked with FEMA and the Department of Health and Human Services to determine how it might carry out the DPA if desired by the White House. So far, there have been no formal requests, according to Ellen Lord, the undersecretary of defense for acquisitions and sustainment.\\n\\nTrump on Tuesday argued that \"the threat\" of him using the act provides leverage over companies that so far, in his view, have stepped up to the task.\\n\\n\"It\\'s called leverage,\" Trump said. \"You don\\'t have to use it from the standpoint of actually, it\\'s been activated, but you don\\'t have to use it.\"\\n\\nHe added, \"But the threat of it being there is great leverage and companies are doing as we ask and companies are actually even better than that.\"\\n\\nNassau County police lead a donation drive to collect medical equipment such as N95 surgical masks, nitrile gloves, tyvex suits, antibacterial and disinfecting wipes to battle the coronavirus pandemic, March 24, 2020. in East Meadow, New York. Al Bello/Getty Images\\n\\nGovernors and members of Congress have called on Trump to use the law, saying not doing so is hampering the nation\\'s ability to meet the demand for medical supplies.\\n\\nSixteen attorneys general this week also sent a letter to the president, calling on him to immediately and \"fully utilize\" the DPA \"to prioritize the production of masks, respirators, and other critical items.\"\\n\\nThe vast majority of the medical supplies -- and raw materials for those supplies -- come from China and other low-wage countries that the U.S. has now found itself relying on. At the same time, many countries around the world are desperately seeking out the same equipment, drastically driving up prices as demand surges.\\n\\nUnlike the United States, China has seized the opportunity, using its centralized, command-and-control economy to rapidly reset supply chains and churn out ventilators and personal protective equipment, according to Nick Vyas, the executive director of the Center for Global Supply Chain Management at the University of Southern California.\\n\\n\"We are missing the opportunity to take the leadership,\" Vyas told ABC News. \"We are missing the opportunity to prepare our public health response.\"\\n\\nThe Trump administration is in the unique position to play a critical role at a time of national crisis, and the DPA would \"absolutely\" help, he said.\\n\\n\"We can certainly create internal capacity for the oncoming demand we anticipate,\" Vyas said. \"I think the federal government needs to insert itself in two ways: infusing the capital and creating an incentive.\"\\n\\nTrump has explained that he does not like \"the concept of nationalizing our business\" by employing the act -- although the law\\'s levers give him ways to get involved in much less intrusive ways.\\n\\n\"Call a person over in Venezuela,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Sunday. \"Ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out. Not too well.\"\\n\\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, though, said that he spoke to businesses that \"would welcome it.\"\\n\\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks in front of stacks of medical protective supplies during a news conference at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, which will be partially converted into a temporary hospital during the outbreak of the coronavirus in New York, March 24, 2020.
