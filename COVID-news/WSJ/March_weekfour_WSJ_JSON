Definitely... Maybe.", "body": "Is your phone covered in germs? Absolutely. Should it be cleaned? Depends on whom you ask. If it makes you feel better, here are the best (and worst) ways to do it. By Joanna Stern Joanna Stern The Wall Street Journal BiographyJoanna Stern @JoannaStern JoannaStern joanna.stern@wsj.com March 12, 2020 9:57 am ET\n\nThe world is on fire, but don't you worry, I'm here to tell you how to clean your smartphone.\n\nThat is, if you really want to clean your phone. Three people I spoke with over the past week said they did not clean their smartphones -- and they're all leading experts on microbiology and infectious disease.\n\nWAIT! WHAT? I thought smartphones were dirtier than a toilet bowl. Heck, even academic studies, like this one from my favorite bedtime reading, the Journal of Hospital Infection, have found considerable amounts of bacteria, including fecal matter, on phone screens.\n\nAnd yet all these experts said some variation of the same thing when I asked about combating coronavirus: thoroughly clean your hands; don't touch your face; don't worry about your phone.\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nHow have you cleaned your phone in the past? Do you plan to change your ways? Join the conversation below.\n\nSure, except what if you're one of those people where your smartphone is basically an extension of your hand? What if I touch a dirty subway pole, then touch my phone, then my phone touches my face? What if someone sneezes directly on my iPhone screen? What if I'm the kind of person who licks my phone? (Don't judge.) A recent study found that, on surfaces such as metal, glass or plastic, coronavirus can survive for anywhere between two hours and nine days.\n\n\"It's possible, theoretically, for this to live on a smartphone. If you had it out and someone sneezed or coughed on it and then you handled the phone, you could pick up infection that way,\" says Daniel R. Kuritzkes, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital. \"People should keep their phones close to themselves. There is very little risk involved then.\"\n\n\"My phone is the least of my concerns,\" says Alex Berezow, a microbiologist and vice president at the American Council on Science and Health. \"Worry about touching door handles that thousands of other people touch.\"\n\nAfter days of disinfecting my phone like a surgical tray, I was shocked. Phone cleaning is certainly not as cut and dried as you thought. After hours of research and scrubbing phones with everything from Clorox wipes to Lysol toilet-bowl cleaner, I've come up with some basic lessons for what you can do -- and not do -- with that petri dish phone of yours.\n\nShould I clean my smartphone?\n\nLet's be very clear: Even when there isn't a pandemic sweeping the globe, your phone can get dirty.\n\nGenerally, that filth is not an issue, says Emma Hayhurst, a microbiologist at the University of South Wales and co-author on the aforementioned Journal of Hospital Infection paper. \"We were trying to avoid mass panic about mucky phones. When you are healthy, it's really not a problem.\"\n\nTranslation: You should clean your phone -- just not compulsively.\n\n\"We don't need to be obsessively washing our phones right now. If people are coming into contact with coronavirus patients, then, yes. Wash your phone all the time. Not because there is evidence that it will transmit via a phone but because there is no evidence that it won't,\" says Dr. Hayhurst.\n\nHow should I clean my smartphone?\n\nIt's long been the guidance of Apple, Samsung and other phone makers to just use a microfiber cloth to shine up your device.\n\nAll my new infectious-disease friends, however, say that to effectively kill the virus on a surface, you need disinfectant solution -- for instance, something with at least 55% isopropyl alcohol.\n\nOn Monday, I reported that Apple updated its website to remove its blanket ban on all cleaning supplies. It now gives the OK to use a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox disinfecting wipe on the surface of all Apple products. Google also confirmed that it's OK to use isopropyl alcohol or Clorox wipes to clean its Pixel devices.\n\nAfter publication of this column, Samsung updated its cleaning guidance to include alcohol-based cleaners. It now advises Galaxy owners to dampen a cloth with a disinfectant or alcohol-based solution and wipe gently. It says not to apply liquid directly onto your phone.\n\nOf course, the big question right now is, where do you BUY the wipes?\n\nCan you use soap and water, as many have asked me? Sure, but avoid using rough paper towels or sponges on the screen. And never use bleach.\n\nCan I damage my smartphone by cleaning it?\n\nThe big cleaning-solution fear cited by smartphone makers is damage to your phone screen's oleophobic layer. This is a protective coating on your screen that repels both water and oil. Basically, it helps minimize fingerprints and smudges.\n\n\"Cleaning products and abrasive materials will diminish the coating and might scratch your iPhone,\" Apple's website reads.\n\nI took it upon myself to test that, as you'll see in the video above. Using a brand-new iPhone 8, I wiped the screen 1,095 times with Clorox disinfecting wipes. I figured that's the equivalent of wiping down your phone every day for the three years you might own it. The only thing showing any wear after all that wiping? My poor, wrinkly fingers. The coating still repelled drops of olive oil like it did when I first took it out of the box.\n\nSo I upped the effort. I was told that hydrochloric acid, found in toilet-bowl cleaner, would take it right off. Yet after five minutes of scrubbing, it was still fine. Soft Scrub with some bleach for five minutes? Still in decent shape. Finally, I decided to let it sit in a stew of toilet-bowl cleaner for two hours, then I threw in a five-minute rubdown with nail-polish remover, which has acetone. That did it...just about. (The phone, miraculously, still worked.)\n\nShould you do any of that? Absolutely not, but these screens are far more resistant to these products than I'd thought. Plus, the oleophobic layer on your phone is going to wear from normal use anyway.\n\nWhen cleaning with your disinfecting wipes, however, avoid getting liquid in the ports. Even if most phones are now water resistant, that resistance wears over time.\n\nWhat about my phone case?\n\nThere's a big difference between cleaning glass or metal and cleaning silicone, plastic or genuine leather. Apple provides good advice on cleaning the various materials its cases are made of. Even if you don't have an official Apple case, these tips can be helpful.\n\nWhen I was at a hospital last week, I met a nurse who had a phone case especially for work. (She still cleans it every day.)\n\nA dedicated phone-cleaning gadget. Really?!\n\nIf you're not into getting your phone and hands all wet, you can try a UV sanitizing gadget like the $100 PhoneSoap Go. Pop your phone in the tiny tanning bed for 10 minutes and the company claims to kill 99.9% of bacteria and germs on it.\n\nWhy use this instead of a wipe? Well, because apparently we suck at cleaning. People don't cover the whole phone well with disinfecting solutions, according to PhoneSoap chief executive and co-founder Wesley LaPorte. Plus, if you don't let the cleaning solution sit for a while -- Clorox recommends four minutes on its container -- some bacteria might survive.\n\n\"This disinfects in a consistent manner,\" Mr. LaPorte says.\n\nI was too busy killing oleophobic coating to test this independently, but the microbiologists I spoke with said UV light can be an effective way to kill bacteria.\n\nPhoneSoap says it has seen 1,000% revenue growth this year, due to increased interest in phone cleaning since the coronavirus spread. Last week, inventory the company put up on Amazon sold out within an hour.\n\nSamsung is fine with you using PhoneSoap or its competitors -- and is even offering free UV cleaning at select Samsung stores, if you feel like venturing out. Apple doesn't explicitly offer in-store cleaning, but store employees are known to clean gadgets using wipes with 70% isopropyl alcohol.\n\nOur anxieties are at an all-time high, understandably. If cleaning makes you feel better, grab some wipes and go to town. Wipe for hours -- even days. Your phone will be just fine. Just remember, you really don't need to. Unless you're one of those crazy phone lickers.\n\n-- Kenny Wassus contributed to this column.\n\n-- For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\n\nHow to Navigate the Coronavirus Read the full report (articles are free) See live updates on the virus and its impact What We Know About the Coronavirus The Virus and Your Job: A New Set of Questions Essentials of Working From Home, and How to Keep Your Home Virus-Free Stock Up on What You Need Without Getting Fleeced Travel Tips to Protect Your Health The Loneliness of Forced Isolation, and How One Family Is Dealing With Life, Disrupted You Aren't Washing Your Hands Right.

"body": "With the pandemic bearing down on the market, sales by insiders spared them $1.9 billion in paper losses, a Journal analysis shows By Susan Pulliam, Susan Pulliam The Wall Street Journal BiographySusan Pulliam Susan.Pulliam@wsj.com Coulter Jones and Coulter Jones The Wall Street Journal BiographyCoulter Jones @coulterjones coulter.jones@wsj.com Andrea Fuller Andrea Fuller The Wall Street Journal BiographyAndrea Fuller @anfuller andrea.fuller@wsj.com March 24, 2020 5:30 am ET\n\nTop executives at U.S.-traded companies sold a total of roughly $9.2 billion in shares of their own companies between the start of February and the end of last week, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows.\n\nThe selling saved the executives -- including many in the financial industry -- potential losses totaling $1.9 billion, according to the analysis, as the S&P 500 stock index plunged about 30% from its peak on Feb. 19 through the close of trading March 20.\n\nThe Journal examined more than 4,000 regulatory filings related to stock sales between Feb. 1 and March 19 by corporate officers of companies traded in the U.S. Avoided losses for the seller are based on the change in the value of each stock between when it was sold and March 20.\n\nBy far the largest executive seller was Amazon. AMZN 3.07% com Inc. Chief Executive Jeffrey Bezos, who sold a total of $3.4 billion in Amazon AMZN 3.07% shares in the first week of February, shortly before the stock market peaked, allowing him to avoid paper losses of roughly $317 million if he had held the stock through March 20, according to the Journal analysis.\n\nThe sales represented roughly 3% of Mr. Bezos's Amazon holdings, according to the most recently available regulatory filings. He sold almost as much stock during the first week in February as he sold during the previous 12 months.\n\nAmazon didn't immediately provide a comment on behalf of Mr. Bezos.\n\nThere is no suggestion that the executives sold shares based on any inside information. The stock market hit an all-time high in February, and executives often sell shares early in the year for tax and other reasons, including preset trading strategies. But the amount of stock sold by executives and officers of U.S.-listed companies was up by roughly one-third from the comparable periods in the previous two years, according to the analysis of regulatory filings and data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nDuring the same period in February and March of 2019, corporate officers sold about $6.4 billion worth of stock\n\nWhile Mr. Bezos's sales accounted for more than a third of the 2020 sales, thousands of other insiders sold stock. More than 150 executives and officers individually sold at least $1 million worth of stock in February and March after having sold no stock in the previous 12 months, the Journal analysis found.\n\nWall Street executives also sold large dollar amounts, including Laurence Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc., who sold $25 million of his company shares on Feb. 14, pre-empting potential losses of more than $9.3 million and Lance Uggla, CEO of IHS Markit Ltd., a data and analytics firm, who sold $47 million of his shares around Feb. 19. Those shares would have dropped in value by $19.2 million if Mr. Uggla had retained them. A spokesperson said the shares were sold under a preset plan.\n\nA spokesperson for BlackRock said Mr. Fink's sales were a small percentage of his holdings and that he sold $18 million in stock around the same time last year. The sales were about 5% or less of Mr. Fink's holdings, according to his latest filing.\n\nSome of the nation's most vulnerable industries are reeling because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the trading by top executives meant less in the way of personal stock losses.\n\nRecent state government orders to limit gatherings have all but shut down some industries, and it is unclear how the public will react even when those lockdowns ease.\n\nSome of the selling was prompted by government-sanctioned trading plans, known as 10b5-1 plans, that allow corporate executives and directors to set in advance the sale of stock for certain prices or dates.\n\nThe stock market's plunge may have triggered some plans, depending on the details, says Adam Epstein, who advises companies on corporate governance practices.\n\n\"What doesn't change -- even if there is such a plan -- is that optically from an investor's perspective it is always bad for investors when CEOs sell shares,\" Mr. Epstein said. He advises chief executives to construct their investment portfolios so they aren't forced to sell shares in order to raise cash if their company's stock falls sharply.\n\nSome of the executives who sold stock came from industries most battered by the economic crisis. James Murren, outgoing CEO of MGM Resorts International, sold $22.2 million of his company's stock, staving off a possible $15.9 million loss. The company's shares closed at $9.11 on Friday, down 73% from their February high.\n\nMr. Murren sold the shares, around the market peak, on Feb. 19 and Feb. 20. A spokesperson noted that the sales came one week after Mr. Murren announced he was leaving MGM. On March 22, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak tapped him to lead the state's response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAmong the executives who sold stock this year but not last year was Marc Rowan, co-founder and director of Apollo Global Management Inc. He sold $99 million in February and early March, avoiding paper losses of about $40 million. A spokesperson pointed to an Apollo public filing that described a plan, put in place last fall, allowing Mr. Rowan to sell shares.\n\nLast week, several members of Congress, their spouses and investment advisers drew fire because they sold stock after the lawmakers met to discuss the threat of coronavirus.\n\nSen. Richard Burr (R., N.C.) sits on two committees that received detailed briefings on the epidemic. On Feb. 13, he and his wife sold as much as $1.7 million in stock. Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R., Ga.) also sold shares.\n\nMs. Loeffler said she was unaware of the trades and that they were handled by advisers. Mr. Burr said he relied on public news reports in making his trading decisions.\n\nMs. Loeffler's husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange Inc., owner of the New York Stock Exchange, sold $18 million in shares of the company he heads during the period, including $15 million in March. That compares with a monthly average off less than $2 million stock in 2019, according to the analysis.\n\nIf he had held the stock, it would have declined by about $3 million in value, according to the Journal analysis. Intercontinental Exchange said in a statement that Mr. Sprecher's sales were part of a prescheduled trading plan.\n\nAs the stock market fell, Marsh & McLennan Cos. CEO Daniel Glaser sold $26.5 million in stock, shaving $6.7 million in potential losses. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show the sales came under a preset plan and that he sold in March in the two previous years as well.\n\nBond-rating company Moody's Corp. CEO Raymond McDaniel sold shares totaling $10 million, compared with his monthly average of $3.3 million in 2019.

Here are the key details:\n\nHow much money is it?\n\nThe plan provides $1,200 for each adult and $500 for each child under 17. A married couple with two children would get $3,400. Most people will receive the money in a payment from the Internal Revenue Service soon.\n\nLoad Error\n\nWho qualifies for the stimulus payments?\n\nThe payments go to almost any adult with a Social Security number, as long as they aren't dependents of someone else. Those adults get the payments for the children in their household.\n\nPayments start phasing out for those with income above $75,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals, $112,500 for heads of household (often single parents) and $150,000 for married couples. The payments start shrinking above those levels.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nFor those with no children, the benefit disappears at $99,000 for individuals and $198,000 for married couples.\n\nWhen will the money arrive?\n\nThe IRS could start issuing payments within three weeks, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The agency hasn't announced a schedule. It will be able to move fastest for people who have filed 2019 tax returns with direct-deposit information and significantly slower for those who will need paper checks.\n\nThe IRS will provide updated information on its website about the process but is urging people not to call yet.\n\nHow does the IRS determine whether you are getting a payment and how much you get?\n\nThe government will use 2019 tax returns to set the payment amounts and 2018 tax returns if 2019 isn't available.\n\nPeople who haven't filed tax returns can still file for 2019 to make sure the government has their updated income and bank-account information, as well as 2019 information about recent births, deaths, marriages, divorces and moves. Such changes that happened after 2019 won't be reflected in the payments, however. Those with low incomes or no income can file tax returns for free using the IRS's Free File program.\n\nThe IRS also will have the ability to get information from the Social Security Administration about people who get benefits but don't typically file tax returns. So these people might not need to file tax returns to claim this payment; the IRS will provide more details about the mechanics.\n\nWhat if I lose a substantial amount of income this year as opposed to 2019?\n\nThe advance payments will be determined based on 2019 income -- or 2018 income if that is all that is available to IRS -- and the final amount of the benefits will be determined based on 2020 income and settled on the 2020 tax return. So people who ultimately qualify for more money than they receive this year -- a person whose income drops from $100,000 to $70,000, for example -- would get the rest through a larger tax refund or smaller tax payment in early 2021.\n\nBut people who ultimately qualify for less money than they got this year -- a person whose income rises from $70,000 to $100,000 -- wouldn't have to pay it back.\n\nNews to stay informed. Advice to stay safe.\n\nClick here for complete coronavirus coverage from Microsoft News\n\nBesides those who make above the income threshold for the payments, is there anyone who doesn't get a payment?\n\nYou must have a Social Security number to get a payment. Also, if you are a dependent on someone else's tax return and you aren't a child, you don't get a payment. That will preclude payments for some elderly adults as well as students over age 16.\n\nAre the payments taxable income?\n\nNo. They won't be considered as income.\n\nWhat about people who owe money to the IRS for prior years?\n\nOther IRS liabilities won't come out of the payments and even people who owe back taxes should get the full amount they qualify for.\n\nWhat about child support?\n\nThe normal IRS rules for child support and tax refunds will apply, which means that refunds for people who are behind on those payments may be smaller.\n\nDo children born in 2020 get the payment?\n\nParents of children born in 2020 won't get a payment for that child now. However, assuming they qualify based on their 2020 income, they will get $500 added to their tax refund or subtracted from their income-tax bill when they file their 2020 tax returns in early 2021.\n\nWrite to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com\n\nRead More", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

FOX -10.41% 's business channel said it parted ways with host Trish Regan, who was taken off the air two weeks ago after she dismissed concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as \"impeachment all over again.\"\n\nMs. Regan hosted \"Trish Regan Primetime\" during Fox Business' 8 p.m. hour until March 13, when her show was put on hiatus due to what Fox Business said were \"the demands of the evolving pandemic crisis coverage.\"\n\nA few days earlier, she had delivered a monologue saying the \"liberal media\" were using the coronavirus to \"destroy\" the president and \"encourage a market selloff.\"\n\n\"This is yet another attempt to impeach the president,\" Ms. Regan said during her March 9 program. \"And sadly, it seems they care very little for any of the destruction they are leaving in their wake. Losses in the stock market -- all this, unfortunately, just part of the political casualties for them.\"\n\nDays later, Ms. Regan said on her program that health professionals should \"test for the virus\" to help prevent its spread.\n\n\"I have enjoyed my time at FOX and now intend to focus on my family during these troubled times,\" Ms. Regan said in a statement Friday released by the network. \"I'm looking forward to this next chapter in my career.\"\n\nAttempts to reach Ms. Regan directly were unsuccessful.\n\nFox Business also said Friday it was \"reducing its primetime coverage\" in order to \"allocate staff resources to continuous breaking news coverage on the Coronavirus crisis.\"\n\nHosts at Fox Business's sister channel Fox News -- including Sean Hannity, host of Fox News' 9 p.m. \"Hannity\" show -- have come under fire for minimizing the threat of the coronavirus before urging caution. Mr. Hannity on March 9 said he would \"call out anyone and everyone who's using this virus as a political weapon against the president\" and likened concerns about the virus as a \"new hoax.\"\n\nThe following week, Mr. Hannity said his program \"has always taken the coronavirus seriously.\"\n\nTucker Carlson, host of Fox News' 8 p.m. show \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" struck a graver tone early on, raising the alarm about the spreading coronavirus in early March during his opening monologue.\n\n\"People you know will get sick,\" Mr. Carlson said. \"Some may die. This is real. That's the point of this script -- to tell you that.\"\n\nFox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.\n\nMs. Regan has been a financial journalist for more than a decade. Before she joined Fox Business in 2015, Ms. Regan anchored \"Street Smart,\" a daily market-close program for Bloomberg TV. Ms. Regan was also an anchor at CNBC, where she hosted a daily markets show and anchored documentaries.\n\nWhile working as a financial correspondent for \"CBS Evening News\" in 2007, Ms. Regan earned an Emmy nomination for investigative journalism, according to her Fox Business bio.\n\nWrite to Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

S. and European leaders are looking at China's progress in curbing the coronavirus pandemic to guide them on how to beat the virus within their own borders.\n\nThey may be drawing the wrong lessons, doctors and health experts say.\n\nThe cordon sanitaire that began around Wuhan and two nearby cities on Jan. 23 helped slow the virus's transmission to other parts of China, but didn't really stop it in Wuhan itself, these experts say. Instead, the virus kept spreading among family members in homes, in large part because hospitals were too overwhelmed to handle all the patients, according to doctors and patients there.\n\nWhat really turned the tide in Wuhan was a shift after Feb. 2 to a more aggressive and systematic quarantine regime whereby suspected or mild cases -- and even healthy close contacts of confirmed cases -- were sent to makeshift hospitals and temporary quarantine centers.\n\nThe tactics required turning hundreds of hotels, schools and other places into quarantine centers, as well as building two new hospitals and creating 14 temporary ones in public buildings. It also underscored the importance of coronavirus testing capacity, which local authorities say was expanded from 200 tests a day in late January to 7,000 daily by mid-February.\n\nThe steps went beyond what's envisioned in many hard-hit Western cities. As a result, many doctors and experts say the recent lockdowns in the U.S. and Europe may slow the rise in new infections -- if properly enforced -- but still won't be enough to stop it or prevent many hospitals from being overwhelmed, as they were initially in Wuhan.\n\n\"A lot of the lessons have been lost,\" said Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. \"A lockdown helps buy time: The only way it will work is if you actually backtrack and start figuring out who has the virus.\"\n\nThe U.S., Britain and some European countries will ultimately, like Wuhan, have to establish multiple makeshift hospitals and quarantine centers to isolate more cases if they are to bring the virus under control, she said.\n\n\"Absent of divine intervention, I don't think there's any other way out of it,\" she said. \"We're heading in that direction: We're just doing it too slow.\"\n\nIn New York City, federal authorities plan to set up mobile hospitals, with a total capacity of 1,000 beds, at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. New York has also been looking into converting entire hotels into hospitals, but it is unclear how many beds will be made available.\n\nZhang Jinnong, head of the emergency department at Wuhan's Xiehe Hospital, said the most important thing was to separate the infected from the healthy, and recommended hotels as quarantine centers where people could be isolated in separate rooms.\n\n\"You just need to turn off the central air conditioning,\" he said.\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nDo you think enough is being done to defeat the coronavirus where you live? Join the conversation below.\n\nHe also said that in recent days he saw a handful of patients who had developed antibodies to the virus without knowingly being infected. That suggested to him that Wuhan might have already developed a level of \"herd immunity.\"\n\nMore than 50,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been identified in Wuhan -- 61% of China's total -- since it was first detected in December, mostly in people connected to a food market selling wild animal meat, according to Chinese health authorities.\n\nThe virus had killed 2,524 people in the city as of Tuesday, representing 77% of China's national toll, and a mortality rate of almost 5%, the world's highest.\n\nSince late February, however, the official number of new confirmed cases in Wuhan has been declining. In the past six days, it has reported only one, prompting Chinese authorities to close all temporary hospitals and start relaxing the lockdown.\n\nChina said on Tuesday that from Wednesday it would relax its mass quarantine to allow healthy people to leave the central province of Hubei, except Wuhan, its capital, where travel restrictions would be similarly eased on April 8.\n\nMany foreign governments that initially ruled out lockdowns, saying they wouldn't work in democracies, are now implementing similar, though less draconian, restrictions, but without corresponding efforts to identify and isolate cases.\n\nSome foreign experts and officials are skeptical of Wuhan as a model. They cite local authorities' early efforts to cover up the scale of the problem, and the fact that more than five million people were able to leave Wuhan in the run-up to the lockdown.\n\nSome also still have doubts about China's official figures. Wuhan's health commission said on Monday that asymptomatic cases were being isolated in quarantine centers but not included in the public tally of confirmed cases, even if they tested positive.\n\nOthers think China could suffer a big second wave of infections if it continues to relax curbs on travel and work, and that the Chinese approach would be too economically costly to replicate.\n\nAmong doctors and residents in Wuhan, meanwhile, some feel the lockdown of the city was too sudden and strict, as well as too late, and contributed to the high mortality rate there as hospitals were ill-prepared for the flood of patients that followed.\n\nMany medical workers were also infected because they initially lacked protective gear and infectious disease training, doctors and nurses in Wuhan say.\n\nStill, the more systematic quarantine and testing regime in Wuhan after Feb. 2 is similar to measures that also appear to have been effective in South Korea and Singapore, according to many experts.\n\nSouth Korea, which has tested more people than any other country, originally tried to hospitalize all confirmed cases. But as wards became overloaded, from March 1 it divided coronavirus patients into four categories: asymptomatic, mild, severe and critical.\n\nOnly severe and critical cases were hospitalized, while mild and asymptomatic cases were placed in makeshift hospitals known as \"residential treatment facilities.\"\n\nIn Singapore, all suspected cases have been isolated in hospitals, while close contacts of confirmed cases have been systematically tracked and quarantined in government-run facilities or at home.\n\nMike Ryan, the World Health Organization's emergencies head, warned on Sunday that lockdowns wouldn't be enough to control the pandemic and urged governments to focus on identifying and isolating infected people and their contacts.\n\n\"It's not just about physical distancing, it's not just about locking down,\" he said. \"In China, and in Singapore, in Korea, they really focused on having that comprehensive strategy.\"\n\nIan Lipkin, an infectious disease expert at Columbia University who visited China in January and has been advising health officials there, says the U.S. should immediately implement a nationwide stay-at-home policy and then move to a \"stratified isolation system\" until a vaccine is ready.\n\n\"We must isolate separately those with disease who need immediate medical attention, those known to be infected who have no or only mild disease, those who are suspected to be infected based on exposure history, and those who have no known exposure and are well,\" he said.\n\nChinese authorities did aim to filter cases when it first locked down Wuhan on Jan. 23. Confirmed and suspected cases were supposed to be quarantined in hospitals, with close contacts self-isolating at home.\n\nThe problem was that local hospitals, which had just 4,000 beds for suspected and confirmed cases, were soon overwhelmed by patients. Experts using mathematical models estimated at the time there were already tens of thousands of people infected.\n\nBy Jan. 27, some 15,000 people were going to the city's fever clinics every day, more than five times the usual number, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Many were sent home without being tested.\n\nBy early February, there were 20,629 people quarantining themselves at home having visited fever clinics -- and that excluded sick people who hadn't yet visited a hospital, Hu Lishan, the city's vice party secretary, told a news briefing.\n\n\"We feel very worried and distressed,\" he said, likening the pent-up demand for hospital space to a \"dammed lake.\"\n\nThe critical change came on Feb. 2, when Wuhan's health authorities tasked community leaders with dividing cases into different categories, sending only confirmed patients to hospitals, and others to makeshift hospitals or quarantine centers.\n\nUnder the new policy, which took some two weeks to implement, suspected cases were also quarantined separately from other categories such as those recently discharged from the hospital and those who had close contact with confirmed cases, local officials and doctors say.\n\nSome 12,000 people ended up staying in temporary hospitals.\n\n\"When you have the opportunity to isolate all suspected patients and close contacts, this is the turning point of the outbreak here in Wuhan,\" said Du Bin, head of the intensive care unit at Peking Union Hospital, who has been working in Wuhan in recent weeks.\n\nHe also echoed the World Health Organization in stressing the importance of testing. \"Apart from testing, I just have no idea how you can identify the suspected cases and how to quarantine the close contacts.\"\n\nAnother critical factor was the deployment to Wuhan of thousands of extra doctors and nurses from elsewhere in China. Among them was Meng Xinke, a doctor from the intensive care department of the No. 2 People's Hospital in Shenzhen.\n\nHe arrived in Wuhan on Feb. 9 and was put to work in an exhibition center newly transformed into a makeshift hospital with 40 doctors and 1,461 beds, for confirmed mild coronavirus cases. Separating milder cases \"is a great way to save resources,\" he said, adding that five doctors were able to look after 400 patients during each shift.\n\nHis daily routine included checking patients' vital signs, giving them medication, conducting tests, and identifying those developing severe symptoms. After about two weeks, he said, his team noticed that about 10%-15% of patients discharged from some makeshift hospitals were later testing positive again -- a possible indication they hadn't fully cleared the virus.\n\nOn Feb. 22, Wuhan required all discharged patients to go to quarantine sites for another two weeks instead of heading home.\n\nHealth experts say other countries short of testing kits can also learn from Wuhan's experience. Unable to test thousands of suspected cases, on Feb. 4, health authorities allowed doctors to use chest scans to make coronavirus diagnoses in Hubei.\n\nThat resulted in a spike in confirmed cases, stunning the outside world. By Feb. 19, however, the number of newly confirmed cases in Wuhan had dropped into the hundreds and by March 11, it was down to single digits. The number of deaths has declined steadily since Feb. 18.\n\nA recent study led by doctors at Wuhan's Tongji Medical College estimated that the reproduction number of the virus -- the average number of people infected by each infected person -- was about 3.68 in Wuhan before the lockdown began on Jan. 23.\n\nThat number, which has to be reduced to below one to stop an epidemic, dropped to 0.32 between Feb. 2 and 18, the study found.\n\n-- Fanfan Wang and Qianwei Zhang in Beijing contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jeremy Page at jeremy.page@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
