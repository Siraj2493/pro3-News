Here are the precautions to take. By Sumathi Reddy Sumathi Reddy The Wall Street Journal BiographySumathi Reddy @rddysum Sumathi.Reddy@wsj.com Updated April 3, 2020 12:10 pm ET\n\nWith communities across the country virtually shut down, there is still one place nearly everyone needs to visit at some point: the grocery store. Experts say deliveries are safer, but sometimes it can be hard to get one scheduled right away. So if you must go to the store, what's the best way to navigate the aisles and crowds? Information and guidance about the virus is changing quickly, so we asked the experts.\n\nIs it safe to go to the grocery store?\n\nTry to minimize visits to the store. \"The biggest risk factor is really being around other people,\" says Benjamin Chapman, a professor of food safety at North Carolina State University.\n\nThat's because the novel coronavirus is spread largely through droplets from nearby people coughing or sneezing. If you must go, maintain a buffer around yourself and try to go at off-hours. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a 6-foot buffer, while the World Health Organization says 3 feet will suffice).\n\nIt's hard to maintain a distance from cashiers, so use self-checkout when possible and use hand sanitizer when you're done.\n\nShould I wear a mask or gloves to the grocery store?\n\nThe thinking on face masks has shifted recently. Previously experts didn't recommend wearing them because the only fully protective masks are N95 respirator masks, which should be fitted and reserved for health-care workers. Now, many say wearing a cloth face mask of some sort is useful in preventing the emission of viral particles, which is important since many people may be asymptomatic.\n\nGloves don't help much if you're going to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with them. Rather, experts say, wash your hands with soap and water before going out and when coming home, and use hand sanitizer when out. If you use gloves, choose disposable ones and throw them away as soon as you get home.\n\nTry not to use your phone when in the store. If you do, clean it when you get home.\n\nShould I bring wipes with me? What should I wipe down?\n\nDr. Chapman says many grocery stores are providing shoppers with wipes. If not, it's a good idea to bring your own, mainly to wipe the grocery cart. Just make sure the wipes are on the list registered with the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nWipes can also be used for other high-touch areas in the store like freezer handles or tongs used in self-serve bins.\n\nAny other precautions I should take?\n\nTry to avoid exchanging money or credit cards with the cashier. Use a credit-card reader when possible.\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nHow are you doing your grocery shopping now? Join the conversation below.\n\nIf I'm a senior or have an underlying medical condition, should I try to go to the store during special seniors hours?\n\nPeople over 65 and those who have medical conditions that put them at greater risk of hospitalization and serious illness should avoid going to the grocery store, if possible. Try to order groceries online or have a family member or friend deliver them while taking precautions. If you must visit the store, go during hours reserved for seniors, when the store is likely to be less crowded.\n\nWhen I get home, what should I do with any paper or plastic bags or packaging?\n\nThough there have been no documented cases of transmission of the novel coronavirus through food packaging, a recent NEJM study found that the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and on hard surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for two to three days. But experts noted that the studies were done in a laboratory with high doses of the virus, so it's unknown if in real life the virus can be transmitted that way. Most likely if someone were to sneeze or cough on a cardboard container, the virus would degrade more quickly due to environmental factors, such as sunlight.\n\nThe study didn't look at paper or plastic bags. Still, James Lloyd-Smith, a professor in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and one of the study's authors, said if someone else handled the materials recently it's a good idea to discard them and wash your hands.\n\nBut experts say wiping down cereal boxes and other packages isn't necessary. \"Use the wipes when you need them,\" says Dr. Chapman. If you're home you can easily wash your hands. \"That's going to reduce your risk as much if not more than trying to wipe everything down,\" he says.\n\nRandy Worobo, a professor of food microbiology at Cornell University, says instead of being preoccupied with wiping down packaging and containers, focus on washing your hands. \"It's much better to treat your hands, wash your hands, rather than dealing with all the surfaces,\" says Dr. Worobo.\n\nWhat about food? Can I get Covid-19 from eating contaminated food?\n\nYour mouth is a gateway to both your respiratory system (your lungs) and your digestive system (stomach). Respiratory viruses like the novel coronavirus are believed to enter the body and reproduce through the respiratory tract, not the digestive tract.\n\nExperts say it is possible that if the virus rubs off from any object to the inside of your mouth, it could infect you if it goes into your respiratory system. But there doesn't appear to be any risk of infection via your digestive tract, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Agriculture Department.\n\nScientists are still studying the virus, so there is always the chance they could find otherwise. But doctors say getting the virus through ingestion of contaminated food seems unlikely. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minn., speculates that the gastric acid in the stomach would kill it. \"My own speculation is that the GI route would be very low likelihood compared to known and efficient methods of infection,\" he says.\n\nTo be extra cautious, you could heat food in the oven or microwave, though this hasn't been specifically studied so it's unclear if there's a particular length of time needed.\n\nWhat if someone coughs or sneezes into your food?\n\nIf you touch virus particles on raw food and then touch your nose, eyes or mouth, that is a potential source of transmission. But experts note that is very unlikely. To be vigilant, thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water, and don't eat your food with your hands.\n\nDo raw fruits and vegetables need to be washed with anything special?\n\nExperts urge people not to wash fruits and vegetables with anything but water. The chemicals on wipes and chlorine solutions especially can be dangerous -- don't ingest those.\n\nWill my clothes be contaminated when I come back from the store? Do I need to change my clothes as soon as I get home?\n\nThere's no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through clothing, but it hasn't been specifically studied. The good news is it can be killed by doing laundry. So if you were in a grocery store where people near you were coughing, it's a good idea to remove your clothes when you get home. Don't shake clothing. Place it in your laundry hamper. The CDC recommends laundering contaminated clothes in the warmest appropriate water setting and drying them thoroughly.\n\nCan I get the virus from food handlers who don't wash their hands well after going to the bathroom?\n\nThe CDC says there are no known cases of the novel coronavirus being spread through the fecal-oral route, which is a common route of transmission for stomach viruses like the norovirus.\n\nBut a recent study that hasn't been peer reviewed yet found the virus in the stool of some patients. This route of transmission remains unknown, and experts say it's unlikely to be contributing significantly to the pandemic.\n\nCoronavirus\n\nFree Resources\n\nLive Updates\n\nSymptoms\n\nWho's Hiring\n\nYou Ask, We Answer\n\nState Lockdowns\n\nDaily Life\n\nTesting\n\nTech Tips\n\nplay-filled-medium\n\nDaily Briefing\n\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\n\nWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com\n\nMore in Health and Wellness\n\nHow to Practice Social Distancing as the Coronavirus Spreads April 3, 2020 What to Know About Getting Noncoronavirus Health Care March 16, 2020 How Vulnerable Are Children to the New Coronavirus?

They do it for too little time, or they don't do it at all.\n\nProper handwashing means scrubbing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nYet just 5% of people spent more than 15 seconds washing their hands after using the restroom, and 10% didn't wash their hands at all, in a study of 3,749 college students published in the Journal of Environmental Health in 2013.\n\nHow to Wash Your Hands\n\nHands are villages to thousands of germs -- including bacteria and viruses. All it takes is a friendly handshake to spread respiratory diseases like Covid-19, the disease caused by the new virus. Respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes can also spread these germs, as can touching surfaces like doorknobs and phones where those droplets may have landed.\n\n\"I don't think we need to panic,\" says Elaine Larson, professor emerita of nursing research at the Columbia School of Nursing, who has helped the World Health Organization develop handwashing guidelines. \"But we do need to be reminded about basic hygiene.\"\n\nThe virus's fate is in your hands -- literally -- so experts say it's time to start practicing what science is preaching.\n\n-- Use soap. Before applying soap to your hands, run water over them. Soap and water together, with rubbing, is what helps rinse organisms off your hands and down the drain. Don't worry about removing hand jewelry, Dr. Larson says. Those need to be washed, too.\n\nSoap acts as a surfactant: a substance that helps release bacteria's grip from your hand when water is added. The study of college students, however, showed only two in three people used soap. The rest just rinsed their hands.\n\nDr. Larson suggests half a teaspoon of liquid soap is enough, or a glob about the size of a quarter, although bigger hands might need more. Health experts say that too much soap can remove your skin's natural oils, which have helpful antibacterial properties.\n\nThe CDC says studies haven't shown that soaps with antibacterial ingredients provide any health benefits or remove more germs than plain soaps. All soaps, however, can deactivate a coronavirus so it can no longer infect you.\n\nThe new coronavirus, coined SARS-CoV-2, is a spherical structure with spiky proteins attached to a membrane, or envelope, that protects the pathogen's genetic material. Once it comes into contact with soap, this envelope dissolves, leaving behind a dysfunctional virus.\n\n\"The envelope is a machine that allows the virus to sneak into human cells,\" says Jonathan Abraham, an assistant professor of microbiology at Harvard Medical School. \"Without it, the virus cannot infect you.\"\n\n-- Scrub all surfaces of your hands. People on average wash their hands for only about six seconds, according to several studies. Twenty seconds is what's recommended -- or, the length of the \"Happy Birthday\" song sung twice -- though it depends on what you touched and how often.\n\nAnd even 20 seconds \"is not helpful if you're not washing the right places,\" Dr. Larson says. \"It's about quality, not quantity.\"\n\nThe most vulnerable parts of your hands are your fingertips, between your fingers, the backs of your hands and under your nails. Rubbing these surfaces with enough force is critical, health experts say. People who have longer nails should be extra cautious, they add.\n\nScrubbing too hard or too frequently can damage your skin by making it dry and more susceptible to cracking, Dr. Larson says. Cuts and cracks give germs the perfect spot to set up shop. To avoid skin damage, Dr. Larson recommends using a moisturizer after washing.\n\nStudies have shown that water temperature doesn't affect how many germs are removed. The CDC says warm or cold water will do, but some experts warn that when water is too hot, it can also damage skin.\n\nAfter a thorough scrub with soap, remove all suds by rubbing every surface of your hands under running, clean water to ensure that pathogens get washed away, Dr. Abraham says. Leaving some soap behind may also soak up moisture from your hands, leaving them dry and more likely to crack.\n\n-- Dry your hands completely. Now it's time to dry your hands as thoroughly as you can, because moist hands give living organisms a better chance of surviving and spreading to others, Dr. Abraham says.\n\nThe CDC says there is not enough data to confirm whether a significant amount of germs are transferred from the faucet knob to your hands. Some experts suggest using a paper towel to turn the water off, while others discourage it because it wastes paper towels.\n\nAutomatic blowers and paper towels both dry hands well.\n\n-- Use alcohol-based sanitizers in a pinch. If you're on the go, alcohol-based sanitizers are great alternatives to soap and water. They cannot kill all viruses, like the norovirus, which lacks a dissolvable envelope. But a sanitizer can kill any coronavirus on your hands as long as it's made up of at least 60% alcohol, health experts say. Plain rubbing alcohol also works, but sanitizers maintain a balance of alcohol and other ingredients to help keep skin healthy and moisturized.\n\nIt's important to use enough sanitizer to cover the entire hand. Dr. Larson suggests half to one teaspoon.\n\nSanitizer also works only when it's still wet, so health experts advise against using paper towels to dab your hands. Give the product at least 10 seconds to complete its job, then rub your hands together or let them air-dry.\n\nGet an early-morning coronavirus briefing each weekday, plus a health-news update Fridays: Sign up.\n\nCoronavirus\n\nFree Resources\n\nLive Updates\n\nSymptoms\n\nStimulus Checks\n\nState Lockdowns\n\nNavigating Daily Life\n\nTech Tips\n\nplay-filled-medium\n\nDaily Video Briefing\n\nMs. Camero is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

The Cambridge Health Alliance, which operates three hospitals and a dozen primary care practices in Massachusetts, is treating its N95 masks with ultraviolet light to decrease a chance of the virus being present when they are reused, according to Jill Batty, the organization's chief financial officer.\n\n\"PPE is like the floor you walk on or the toothbrush you use to brush your teeth. It never occurs to you that it's a precious commodity until you don't have it,\" said Dr. Esther Choo, a Portland, Ore.-based emergency physician who started the trending hashtag #GetMePPE.\n\nIf I have spare masks and other supplies at home, how do I donate them?\n\nThe American Medical Association recommends anyone who has PPE to contact their local hospital or health department \"to ensure these resources are appropriate and can be distributed based on need,\" AMA President Dr. Patrice Harris said in a statement.\n\nYou can also visit GetUsPPE.org for instructions submitted by health-care workers themselves, which include specifications for items they need most, as well as how to get those items to donation sites. The website is searchable by region and state.\n\nIf you have supplies to donate, but aren't able to get them to a donation site yourself, you can also fill out the form at the bottom of this page to be contacted by a volunteer for pickup.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment: Waging a Virus War\n\nThe need for PPE is growing while stockpiles are precariously low. A look at what exactly is needed to protect our health-care personnel while all-important testing and treatment takes place.\n\nMask Effectiveness\n\nHealth experts say that properly used, the N95 respirator mask can guard against the new coronavirus. Frequently changing disposable masks, and washing your hands after, are important steps to avoid contamination from pathogens that cling to the outer surface. Experts say N95 masks are designed for health-care workers in the hospital, not the general public.\n\nMasks\n\n1 N95 masks offer more protection. But they only work if they fit properly, and aren't suitable for children or people with facial hair.2 Surgical masks don't offer full protection against airborne viruses. They don't fully seal off the nose and mouth. 3 Face Shields are thin clear plastic shields secured with a visor-like device. This may not stop you from contracting the coronavirus, but it will lessen the chances. It is good at blocking sprayed liquids that may contain the respiratory pathogen.\n\nAirborne Droplets\n\nSurgical masks are highly effective against large airborne droplets. These traditional masks are less effective with small droplets, as such droplets can travel farther and in unpredictable paths affected by wind and other gusts. The droplets can be inhaled around the sides of the masks. 1 Small droplets 2 Large droplets.\n\nPPE Gowns, Scrubs and Gloves\n\n1 Gowns are thin polymer robes that are normally all that stand between patients with Covid-19 and health-care personnel. They are certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. If a hospital runs out of these certified gowns, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using reusable patient gowns. 2 Scrubs are fabric or fabric-blend clothing worn by health-care personnel for on-the-job use or in a manner similar to street clothes. Most scrub tops have short sleeves, which makes them ill-suited for PPE, as PPE must cover the arms down to the wrists, to protect them from aerosols. They can be worn under PPE and undergarments. 3 Nonsterile gloves are recommended for PPE. For added protection, two pairs of gloves can be worn\u00ad -- one pair under PPE and one pair over it.\n\nHoods, Shoes and Shoe Coverings\n\n1 Hoods were recommended for Ebola virus health-care personnel in 2014, but not for Covid-19 health-care workers. They can be used for added protection. 2 Fluid-resistant shoes are recommended by the CDC, but shoe covers 3 can also be worn for an added degree of protection. Shoe covers were in use during the Ebola crisis in 2014.\n\nSources:\n\nCDC, FDA, BMC Infectious Diseases, Journal of Hospital InfectionResearch: Lindsay Huth Taylor Umlauf and Kevin Hand Graphic: Kevin Hand and Alberto Cervantes/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nCan I donate homemade masks?\n\nHealth-care professionals are mixed on the efficacy of homemade face masks, and not all hospitals and clinics accept them.\n\nNurses shouldn't wear cloth masks because they don't afford significant protections, according to American Nurses Association President Dr. Ernest Grant.\n\nSome doctors, however, encourage people with the means to sew their own face masks to do so anyway. \"Any face mask is better than no face mask,\" said Dr. Choo, who suggested members of the public check their local hospitals or clinics about their individual policies toward homemade mask donations.\n\nAnother idea is to keep the homemade face masks for yourself and donate any supply you may have of medical-grade masks to your local hospital, said Andy Shin, the Chicago-based chief operating officer of the American Hospital Association's Center for Health Innovation.\n\n\"There is literature out there that supports the use of homemade face masks,\" said Dr. Bryan Wolf, a Portland, Ore.-based radiologist who created a guide to making face masks after noticing a need in his community.\n\nEven if hospitals don't accept donations of homemade face masks, Dr. Wolf recommends making them for workers at health-care facilities who might not have access to hospital-approved PPE, like hospital receptionists and janitorial staff.\n\n\"I think some people are forgotten,\" he said.\n\nPeople interested in Dr. Wolf's guide for homemade face masks and face shields, with additional background information, can find it here.\n\nIf I don't have personal protective equipment to donate, how else can I help?\n\nAccording to the American Nurses Association, contact your elected officials. \"Encourage them to use the power of the federal government to send PPE to those in most need,\" said Dr. Grant.\n\nSome hospitals are also requesting monetary donations to support coronavirus treatment, as well as to go toward supporting hospital staff. New York University's Langone Health hospital network, for example, directs people who are interested in donating to this site: https://nyulangone.org/give/funds/covid-19. Check your local hospital's website for its specific donation site.\n\nMany health-care workers are dealing with child care and meal preparation on top of their duties at work, said Dr. Megan Ranney, a Providence, R.I.-based emergency physician at Rhode Island Hospital and one of the founders of GetUsPPE. Hospitals, including her own, have set up ways to link health-care providers with child-care assistance, and people can consider ways to support these efforts.\n\nLastly, the best way to help health-care workers in this pandemic is to stay home, said Dr. Grant, a point echoed by doctors, nurses and medical staff across the nation.\n\nHow can I help if I am the owner of a manufacturing business?\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has released new guidance that allows for more manufacturers to make ventilators. If you currently manufacture ventilators or want to begin, you can read their guidance here.\n\nSome states, like New York, are encouraging companies with the proper equipment or personnel to begin to manufacture PPE. New York's guidelines can be found here.\n\nThe American Hospital Association has also put out a call for manufacturers to help their local hospitals produce surgical masks and face shields.
