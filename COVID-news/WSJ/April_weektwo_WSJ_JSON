Nancy Hopkins leaned down and rubbed his arm just before paramedics put him into an ambulance. \"I'll be with you every step of the way,\" Ms. Hopkins promised him.\n\nThat was as close as she would ever again get to her dad. When she arrived at the nearby hospital in Conway, S.C., that evening in mid-March, she learned she could not go in because of visitor restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. She sat alone in her car in the hospital parking lot for hours, crying when she finally drove off.\n\nHer father, Robert McCord, a retired livestock dealer, was sick with the coronavirus and lay for 14 days in an isolation room on the top floor of Conway Medical Center. When he neared death on April 1, Ms. Hopkins said goodbye through a phone, placed in a plastic bag and held to his ear by a nurse.\n\n\"It has been the biggest challenge of my life, knowing I couldn't be there,\" says Ms. Hopkins, who is 59 and a schoolteacher. \"Because my father depended on me.\"\n\nA brutal hallmark of the pandemic is the way it isolates its victims even in their final moments. Patients die alone in hospital rooms, cut off from their spouses, children, siblings and often their pastors or rabbis. The emotional end-of-life moments, if they happen at all, unfold over an electronic tablet or phone, with a stranger serving as an intermediary.\n\n\"I struggle with saying words like 'unfair,' but that is what it really feels like,\" says David \"Michael\" Dudley Jr. He said goodbye to his 61-year-old father, who was dying from the new coronavirus, over a Zoom videoconference on March 31. \"You're not only telling me my dad is not going to recover,\" he says, \"but I can't even be there to say anything. I've got to do it in probably the most impersonal way possible.\"\n\nThe elder Mr. Dudley, a charter bus driver, had woken up with a cough one week earlier and was on a ventilator in a Baltimore hospital. The younger Mr. Dudley, 36, didn't know if his father could hear him, but he had things he wanted to say, mainly \"I love you.\" He strained to get the words out in the awkward group call with other relatives, and doctors and nurses in the hospital room.\n\n\"I squeezed one in at the end,\" he says.\n\nLouisville, Ky., family matriarch Keiko Neutz was rarely alone before the pandemic. Her huge family saw to that.\n\nMs. Neutz, widowed decades ago, raised eight children, at times working in an elementary-school cafeteria. She'd had a stroke five years ago, but still lived in her own house. One person in the family would stay with her, on a rotating schedule, every single night. Most of her children and 28 grandchildren lived within a 15-minute drive of her house.\n\nShe was 87 and stood just 4 feet 10 inches -- a \"spitfire,\" as one of her grandchildren put it. If you missed a family gathering, you would expect a grilling from Ms. Neutz. She taught children's Bible study and loved the slot machines at casinos. Nobody laughed harder at a practical joke.\n\nThen came the shortness of breath that landed her in a hospital bed on March 25. She tested positive for Covid-19, was put on an oxygen machine and went downhill quickly. Two days later, on a Friday night, the family was forced to make a decision about whether to put her on a ventilator or not. Ms. Neutz had said not long ago that she didn't want that. They had to be sure.\n\nSix of her eight grown children, ages 52 to 64, drove separately to Norton Brownsboro Hospital in Louisville and gathered in the dimly lit parking lot, standing 6 feet apart to maintain a social distance.\n\nThe hospital allowed one of them to suit up in full protective gear, akin to a hazmat suit, and go into her room briefly. Daughter Kathy Mills, 62, entered to find Ms. Neutz weary but awake, lying on her side with one arm extended off the bed.\n\nMs. Mills looked out at her from behind an N95 respirator mask, and a second mask atop that, and safety goggles. Wearing two pairs of blue hospital gloves, she grabbed her mother's hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry I can't kiss you,\" she told her mom through tears.\n\nDid she want to go to heaven, she asked her mother.\n\nMs. Neutz nodded, and gestured to the medical equipment in the room. \"This is too much,\" she said softly.\n\nMs. Mills went back out to the parking lot, and a nurse called down and let each sibling say goodbye by FaceTime right then. Debbie Taylor, another daughter, ached listening to her siblings' intimate goodbyes.\n\n\"We couldn't hug each other,\" she says. \"It was unnatural. Normally, we would have been crying on each other's shoulders.\"\n\nMs. Neutz made it into the weekend. Granddaughter Lacy Taylor, 29, delivered a laptop loaded with the social networking app Houseparty to the hospital. A nurse set it up facing Ms. Neutz's bed, essentially giving the family a live feed into the hospital room.\n\nDebbie Taylor spotted the nurses in their protective gear in the room, and wondered what her mom thought. \"Do these Covid patients think there are aliens in the rooms?\" she recalls thinking.\n\nThe family sang and talked to her. Ms. Neutz would reach out to touch the screen when her great-grandchildren came into the picture. Relatives were watching as she took her final breath at 7:45 a.m. Monday.\n\nNurses Audrey Waters and Julia Hunt were each holding one of Ms. Neutz's hands as she died. Ms. Waters, 33, had worked overnight but stayed past her shift because she and Ms. Hunt had promised the family they wouldn't let Ms. Neutz be alone.\n\n\"I felt blessed to be able to be there,\" says Ms. Hunt, who is 28. \"But it absolutely ripped my heart out as well.\"\n\nNear Toledo, Ohio, nurse Helen Revesz says she has never been through anything like this during her 35 years in the profession. Previously, when someone was dying, she would call the family so they could be in the room. Relatives would both comfort the patient and commune and mourn with one another.\n\nMs. Revesz recently, in a first for her, arranged a FaceTime video call so grown children could say goodbye to their father, who was dying of Covid-19. \"It's hard,\" she says. \"You put yourself in their place.\"\n\nSuch video calls have become so necessary for patients and their families in the Covid-19 crisis that Littleton Adventist Hospital in Colorado is aiming to have an iPad in every room shortly, says Stephen Guyer, the hospital's chaplain.\n\nAnd Covid Tech Connect, a nonprofit set up in March, is aiming to eventually put 10,000 tablets in hospitals and nursing homes. So far, about 2,500 donated tablets have been pledged, and the group has raised more than $125,000 toward a $1 million goal. The first shipments were set to go out by the end of this week.\n\nSara Rodell, one of the group's founders, says she was inspired by a text message on March 27 from a friend who is a nurse who needed help sourcing tablets that would allow dying patients to say goodbye to their families. \"This just really got me,\" says Ms. Rodell.\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nWhat more can hospitals do to ease the burden of keeping families separate from dying coronavirus patients? Join the conversation below.\n\nSome of the Covid-19 patients seem unaware they are isolated, while others understand, says the Rev. Michael Mercier, the director of spiritual care for Lifespan, a health system in Rhode Island. \"I have never seen as many patients cry when I am praying with them,\" he says, adding that they feel cut off from family.\n\nThere and at many hospitals, the chaplains now often pray at patients' doors to avoid picking up the virus.\n\nRabbi Jason Kirschner, the staff chaplain at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, recently got a request from a family to do a Vidui, a Jewish prayer of confession, which usually is recited by a rabbi or family member if the dying person is unable to do so.\n\nHe and volunteers scrambled on a weekend to find a Jewish doctor who could go into the room and perform the deathbed rite. \"This is not something doctors typically do,\" the rabbi says. \"It's just a very difficult time.\"\n\nAs Tim Funk's 89-year-old mother lay dying from the new coronavirus in St. Elizabeth Ft. Thomas Hospital in Kentucky on April 2, the family wondered whether a chaplain could be found to give her one final blessing.\n\nThe nurses said their policy barring visitors included priests, but if the family could find a priest right away, a nurse would go into his mother's room with an iPad and coordinate a video call.\n\nIt was 9:45 p.m., and Mr. Funk, a former religion reporter, was almost 500 miles away in Charlotte, N.C. He called Father Frank O'Rourke, a retired pastor of St. Gabriels Catholic Church in Charlotte. Within 10 minutes, a nurse called Father O'Rourke from Mrs. Funk's bedside. He recited a prayer, while nurses, dressed in protective clothing, tended to Mrs. Funk.\n\nA nurse told Mr. Funk that his mother died minutes after the blessing. \"I don't know if the nurse was trying to make me feel better,\" he says. \"But we are choosing to believe her.\"\n\nIn Conway, S.C., that same week, it pained critical-care nurse Kelli Culclasure to see Covid-19 patient Robert McCord nearing death alone. Even sedated and hooked to a ventilator, the elderly man had a face that radiated friendliness, she thought.\n\nIn fact, Mr. McCord was a people person. The widower had coffee with his daughter every afternoon, notched near perfect attendance at church and didn't even have to order when he sat down at his favorite diner on Main Street every Saturday. The servers knew what he wanted: Sausage, eggs and grits.\n\nOn the morning of Wednesday, April 1, Ms. Culclasure, a nurse for 34 years, put a hospital-staff mobile phone in a plastic bag to keep it sterile. She took out a list of numbers she had collected from the family.\n\nAnd then, one by one, she called Mr. McCord's son, his two daughters -- including Nancy Hopkins, who had brought him to the hospital -- his brother and a close family friend to let them say goodbye. She held the bagged phone to her patient's ear and watched his face.\n\n\"I hope this man hears this,\" she thought to herself. \"I hope these voices are his last memory.\"\n\nWhen she finished the phone calls, she leaned down and touched his shoulder with one gloved hand.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" she told him. She and another nurse stayed with him until he died.\n\nAn hour later, four siblings in a different family were about to go through the same ritual.\n\nJust after noon in Ohio, Nick Ramos saw that his sister had posted to their family group chat. A nurse in a hospital room with their father wanted to set up a FaceTime video call.\n\nThe father, Joe Ramos, 73, was in ProMedica Bay Park Hospital in Oregon, Ohio, dying from Covid-19.\n\nNick Ramos, 42, was in Hollywood, Calif., where he lives. His three siblings, who all live within an hour's drive of the hospital, felt it wasn't safe to visit because they were concerned about exposure to the virus.\n\nThe siblings took turns saying goodbye.\n\nWhen Mr. Ramos's time came, he saw his father struggling to keep his eyes open. He heard the machines keeping him alive. He filled that final conversation with small talk until he ran out of words.\n\nThen the nurse turned the camera on herself. Mr. Ramos saw her head-to-toe protective suit, including a face mask and a helmet.\n\n\"That's when the reality of everything set in,\" he says. He raced to say his final words to his father. \"My heart just exploded and anything and everything I could thank him for came gushing out.\"\n\nWrite to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com and Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Lev Radin/Zuma Press\n\nAmazon.com Inc. will halt a delivery service for non-Amazon packages, according to people familiar with the matter, as it re-evaluates the nascent offering that competes directly with FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc.\n\nAmazon told shippers the service, known as Amazon Shipping, will be paused starting in June. It was available in just a handful of U.S. cities.\n\nUnder the program, Amazon drivers would pick up packages from businesses and deliver them to consumers, rather than ship orders from Amazon warehouses.\n\nLoad Error\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\n\"We understand this is a change to your business, and we did not take this decision lightly,\" Amazon said in a note to shippers reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \"We will work with you over the next several weeks so there is as little disruption to your business as possible.\"\n\nAmazon is suspending the service because it needs its people and capacity to handle a surge in its own customers' orders, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company has said it wants to hire 100,000 warehouse workers and is focusing on shipping essential items during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAmazon in the past had sought to woo shippers to the new service by offering simpler rates, including the elimination of many fees and surcharges that other carriers add on to pad their revenues. It tested the program in London and Los Angeles, but didn't make it widely available in the U.S.\n\nCOVID-19 Symptoms Survey\n\nHelp researchers at the Regenstrief Institute track the outbreak Go to the survey\n\nAmazon remains a force in the shipping industry, with over 30,000 vehicles, 20,000 trailers and dozens of aircraft that move packages across the country. In addition to its own delivery drivers, Amazon also hands off a significant chunk of its home deliveries to UPS and the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nAmazon last year ended a shipping contract with FedEx, which increasingly viewed the online merchant as a competitive threat because of its growing shipping prowess.\n\nFedEx and UPS have experienced a Christmas-like boom in home deliveries in recent weeks as people shop from home, while shipments have deteriorated to stores or businesses that have closed.\n\nMeanwhile, the virus has upended the daily routine of delivering packages. Amazon, FedEx and UPS have each had to implement new safety measures and scramble to provide protective equipment as some workers test positive for the coronavirus.\n\nA UPS spokesman declined to comment.\n\nFedEx said its ground network is well prepared to manage the current surge in e-commerce. \"We are continuing to work with our small business customers during this time to support their growth,\" a FedEx spokeswoman said.\n\nWrite to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com\n\nRead More", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors":
