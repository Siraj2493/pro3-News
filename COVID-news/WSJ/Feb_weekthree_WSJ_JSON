By Walter Russell Mead Walter Russell Mead The Wall Street Journal BiographyWalter Russell Mead @wrmead walter.r.mead Feb. 3, 2020 6:47 pm ET\n\nThe mighty Chinese juggernaut has been humbled this week, apparently by a species-hopping bat virus. While Chinese authorities struggle to control the epidemic and restart their economy, a world that has grown accustomed to contemplating China's inexorable rise was reminded that nothing, not even Beijing's power, can be taken for granted.\n\nWe do not know how dangerous the new coronavirus will be. There are signs that Chinese authorities are still trying to conceal the true scale of the problem, but at this point the virus appears to be more contagious but considerably less deadly than the pathogens behind diseases such as Ebola or SARS -- though some experts say SARS and coronavirus are about equally contagious.\n\nChina's initial response to the crisis was less than impressive. The Wuhan government was secretive and self-serving; national authorities responded vigorously but, it currently appears, ineffectively. China's cities and factories are shutting down; the virus continues to spread. We can hope that authorities succeed in containing the epidemic and treating its victims, but the performance to date has shaken confidence in the Chinese Communist Party at home and abroad. Complaints in Beijing about the U.S. refusing entry to noncitizens who recently spent time in China cannot hide the reality that the decisions that allowed the epidemic to spread as far and as fast as it did were all made in Wuhan and Beijing.\n\nThe likeliest economic consequence of the coronavirus epidemic, forecasters expect, will be a short and sharp fall in Chinese economic growth rates during the first quarter, recovering as the disease fades. The most important longer-term outcome would appear to be a strengthening of a trend for global companies to \"de-Sinicize\" their supply chains. Add the continuing public health worries to the threat of new trade wars, and supply-chain diversification begins to look prudent.\n\nEvents like the coronavirus epidemic, and its predecessors -- such as SARS, Ebola and MERS -- test our systems and force us to think about the unthinkable. If there were a disease as deadly as Ebola and as fast-spreading as coronavirus, how should the U.S. respond? What national and international systems need to be in place to minimize the chance of catastrophe on this scale?\n\nEpidemics also lead us to think about geopolitical and economic hypotheticals. We have seen financial markets shudder and commodity prices fall in the face of what hopefully will be a short-lived disturbance in China's economic growth. What would happen if -- perhaps in response to an epidemic, but more likely following a massive financial collapse -- China's economy were to suffer a long period of even slower growth? What would be the impact of such developments on China's political stability, on its attitude toward the rest of the world, and to the global balance of power?\n\nChina's financial markets are probably more dangerous in the long run than China's wildlife markets. Given the accumulated costs of decades of state-driven lending, massive malfeasance by local officials in cahoots with local banks, a towering property bubble, and vast industrial overcapacity, China is as ripe as a country can be for a massive economic correction. Even a small initial shock could lead to a massive bonfire of the vanities as all the false values, inflated expectations and misallocated assets implode. If that comes, it is far from clear that China's regulators and decision makers have the technical skills or the political authority to minimize the damage -- especially since that would involve enormous losses to the wealth of the politically connected.\n\nWe cannot know when or even if a catastrophe of this scale will take place, but students of geopolitics and international affairs -- not to mention business leaders and investors -- need to bear in mind that China's power, impressive as it is, remains brittle. A deadlier virus or a financial-market contagion could transform China's economic and political outlook at any time.\n\nMany now fear the coronavirus will become a global pandemic. The consequences of a Chinese economic meltdown would travel with the same sweeping inexorability. Commodity prices around the world would slump, supply chains would break down, and few financial institutions anywhere could escape the knock-on consequences. Recovery in China and elsewhere could be slow, and the social and political effects could be dramatic.\n\nIf Beijing's geopolitical footprint shrank as a result, the global consequences might also be surprising. Some would expect a return of unipolarity if the only possible great-power rival to the U.S. were to withdraw from the game. Yet in the world of American politics, isolation rather than engagement might surge to the fore. If the China challenge fades, many Americans are likely to assume that the U.S. can safely reduce its global commitments.\n\nSo far, the 21st century has been an age of black swans. From 9/11 to President Trump's election and Brexit, low-probability, high-impact events have reshaped the world order. That age isn't over, and of the black swans still to arrive, the coronavirus epidemic is unlikely to be the last to materialize in China.\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The city of Osaka took a matching step.\n\nTracking the Coronavirus The death toll stands at more than 2,200. In mainland China, more than 75,000 people have been confirmed infected. Outbreaks in Chinese prisons prompt worries about unknown clusters. South Korea reported a jump in new cases, with most linked to a megachurch. What We Know About the Coronavirus\n\nA public speech by Emperor Naruhito scheduled for Sunday, his 60th birthday, was canceled, and businesses are curtailing large meetings. Honda Motor Co. said it was canceling any event with more than 100 attendees for now.\n\nAs of Friday, the health ministry said 93 people in Japan were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus that causes the disease known as Covid-19. That figure doesn't include more than 600 people infected on a cruise ship docked at Yokohama. Three Japanese have died of the disease, including two from the ship.\n\n\"Now is an important time for efforts not to spread the infection,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a regular news conference. He said the government wasn't mandating a ban on events but \"asks people and businesses to cooperate.\"\n\nJapan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has indefinitely postponed its annual party conference, initially scheduled for March 8. Many large companies typically hold mass recruitment events in the spring at the end of Japan's academic year that are now being called off. Organizers of the Tokyo Marathon cut more than 30,000 public runners from the March 1 race, citing concerns about the spread of the virus.\n\nConcert halls and movie theaters, meanwhile, haven't yet made major changes to their operations, and rush-hour trains in Tokyo remain crowded.\n\nMasahiro Kami, an infectious diseases expert, said he was skeptical that the suspension of some public events would have a significant impact on the spread of the virus. \"Commuting on a packed train, for instance, is way worse than taking part in the Tokyo marathon,\" he said.\n\nDr. Kami, who heads a nonprofit organization called the Medical Governance Research Institute, said a media focus on the few cases of serious illness from coronavirus infection in Japan had created a panic over the need to cancel events.\n\nWhile Japan initially had a handful of cases involving people who had come from Wuhan, the center of the epidemic in China, or had direct contact with someone from Wuhan, a surge of cases in the past week included many whose path of infection wasn't clear. The cases span from Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa in the far south.\n\nMore than 1,000 people disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship between Wednesday and Friday, and they entered Japan without restrictions on their movements. All of those passengers tested negative for the virus, but in some cases people have tested positive after a negative test -- including two cases reported Friday in Australia, which sent a flight to Japan to repatriate citizens who had been on the ship.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry. Sign up.\n\nA plane carrying Canadian cruise-ship passengers home landed Friday, as did one repatriating Israelis.\n\nOne risk for Japan from the spread of the virus is disruption to the Olympics, scheduled to be held in Tokyo from July 24. Members of the International Olympic Committee and the Japanese organizing committee for the Games said last week the tournament would go ahead as planned, but on Thursday a test event for the Paralympics, which are set to take place after the Olympics, was postponed because of the virus.\n\nThe spread of the virus may also weigh on attendance at public parties in parks for Japan's cherry-blossom viewing season. The latest forecasts suggest the blooming of the cherry flowers may peak in the Tokyo region in mid-March, much earlier than in typical years.\n\nMore Japan Defends Handling of Coronavirus-Struck Cruise Ship Two Coronavirus Cruise Ship Passengers Die in Japan Ship Evacuation Set Off Race for U.S. Hospital Beds Life in Lockdown: 'We Can Make It Through This'\n\n-- Miho Inada and Suryatapa Bhattacharya contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

AAPL -2.35% became the first major U.S. company to say it won't meet its revenue projections for the current quarter due to the coronavirus outbreak, which it said had limited iPhone production for world-wide sales and curtailed demand for its products in China.\n\nThe tech giant had projected last month record revenue for the current quarter of between $63 billion and $67 billion, which it said was a wider than normal range due to the virus. The technology giant didn't provide on Monday an updated sales estimate, saying that the situation in China is evolving. It said it would provide more information when it holds its earnings call in April.\n\nApple's announcement is the most prominent example yet of the broad ripple effects of the coronavirus on global business and markets as the outbreak continues to spread, hitting smartphone sales and commodity prices and delaying production across industries.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nHas the outbreak affected your work or business? How? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe difficulties are extending into supply chains around the world as assembly lines from Asia to Europe depend upon parts moving swiftly from China into their plants.\n\nVolkswagen AG said Monday it would postpone production restarts at some Chinese plants for another week. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said last week it temporarily halted production in Serbia because it couldn't get parts from China, which continues to deal with manufacturing delays as it seeks to contain the spread of the virus.\n\nOil prices have fallen 11% in recent weeks in anticipation of reduced demand from the world's most populous country, and the outbreak has also weighed on iron-ore prices. A dearth of Chinese tourists in the U.S. has also hit a number of luxury brands such as Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. and Capri Holdings Ltd., which owns the Versace and Jimmy Choo brands. The timing of an initial public offering for multibillion-dollar startup Airbnb Inc. may also be affected, according to a person close to the company.\n\nChinese consumers are also an increasingly important market for global brands. The coronavirus' impact on China, the world's second-largest economy, will depend on how quickly manufacturers are able to resume production. The manufacturing sector is a core pillar of the country's economy, accounting for nearly 30% of the nation's gross domestic product in 2019.\n\nApple's announcement is the second time in two years that the company has reset revenue projections because of problems in China. A year ago, it slashed guidance for the first time in more than 15 years because of weak iPhone demand in China and elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe back-to-back revisions underscore how China, once one of Apple's strengths, has emerged as one of its greatest challenges. The company has relied on China's manufacturing sector -- with its low-cost and abundant workforce -- to assemble the vast majority of the products it sells world-wide. It also has become one of the most successful U.S. brands in China. It had $44 billion in sales last year across Greater China, a region that includes Hong Kong and Taiwan and accounts for nearly a fifth of the company's total revenue.\n\nThe twin dependency on China's manufacturing and consumer sectors made Apple vulnerable as the new coronavirus paralyzed the country. The Chinese government moved to contain the virus by limiting movement across the country and locking down Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the outbreak. Concerns over the virus led to the closure of stores across the country and caused a 10-day delay in the resumption of manufacturing following the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nApple said its contract manufacturers were ramping up production \"more slowly than we had anticipated.\" As a result, it said that there would be iPhone supply shortages that temporarily affect world-wide sales.\n\nTracking the Coronavirus\n\n14 Americans repatriated to the U.S. from the Diamond Princess tested positive for the virus. An additional 99 people aboard the ship tested positive for the virus on Monday, bringing the total to 454. Beijing is weighing plans to postpone its biggest political assembly as the government races to contain the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nIt also said the closure of its own stores and many partner stores across China had affected sales of its products. Many stores have been operating at reduced hours and had very low customer traffic, the company said. It added that it is gradually reopening its stores and will continue to do so as soon as possible. The company said that outside of China demand for its products and services had been strong and in line with expectations.\n\nThe announcement Monday represented a swift reversal in Apple's expectations for the quarter. In late January, Chief Executive Tim Cook played down the risk of the virus, saying the company was developing plans to make up for any lost production from Wuhan, where two of Apple's top 200 suppliers are based. He said Apple expected factories elsewhere to reopen after the 10-day delay.\n\n\"We factored our best thinking in the guidance that we provided you,\" Mr. Cook said in January.\n\nApple said it is more than doubling a previously announced donation to support public health efforts in China.\n\nThe virus threatens to derail Apple's business just as the company was showing signs it had regained its momentum. After weaker iPhone sales contributed to a 2% decline in total revenue for the 2019 fiscal year ended in September, the company last month reported record revenue and profit behind strong sales of its flagship smartphone, as well as apps and AirPods wireless earbuds.\n\nApple's shares have rallied over the past year behind the release of its latest iPhone, enthusiasm about growing sales of subscription services and anticipation of its first 5G smartphones later this year. Its market value has more than doubled since early last year to $1.4 trillion.\n\nDow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.\n\nStill, Apple needed a steady supply of iPhones to extend its sales growth into the current quarter. As the coronavirus spread, travel restrictions made it difficult for its largest manufacturing partner, Foxconn Technology Co., to secure workers for its factories, according to people familiar with its supply chain. Some plants have resumed limited production but are uncertain when they will return to full capacity, one of these people said.\n\nFoxconn is aiming to resume 50% of mainland China production by the end of February, and 80% in mid-March, another person familiar with the matter said.\n\nFoxconn didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nManufacturers must take measures to ensure the virus won't spread within their factories, where oftentimes hundreds or thousands of workers gather for one shift. For instance, in Kunshan, a manufacturing hub near Shanghai where Foxconn has a plant, the government is requiring companies to check all workers at entrances and quarantine workers returning from regions where the virus outbreak is severe.\n\nThe city also requires that companies have enough masks, thermometers and disinfectants to last for at least three days.\n\nMore\n\nCoronavirus Cruise Passengers Land in U.S., Including 14 Infected Tokyo Marathon Closes to Public Participants Cambodia Tests Hundreds on Cruise for Virus Outbreak Sets Back China's Biggest Political Assembly\n\nWrite to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

And the way they were doing a virus quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship didn't look right.\n\nDr. Hopland, a passenger, counted as many as 10 interactions a day with staff coming to deliver meals, toiletries and chocolate to keep up spirits. Passengers were drying laundry on their balconies without wearing face masks. Some leaned over to talk to their next-door neighbors.\n\nTracking the Coronavirus Chinese officials celebrated a drop in the number of new coronavirus infections and deaths. China's State Council called on \"low-risk regions\" around the country to resume full production. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that the vast majority of confirmed cases were mild. The head of Wuhan's Wuchang Hospital died of the coronavirus.\n\nAs the two-week quarantine comes to an end Wednesday, the result of such holes is becoming clear. On Tuesday, the number of passengers and crew who caught the novel coronavirus passed 500, Japan's government said, offering new evidence that the quarantine failed to stop more people from getting infected.\n\nTracking the Coronavirus\n\nVIEW In Depth\n\nJust before he was supposed to get on a U.S.-chartered plane back home with his wife, Regina, Dr. Hopland got a knock on his cabin door and learned the hard way what could happen when his warnings weren't heeded: Mrs. Hopland tested positive for the novel coronavirus. He also found out his room steward had taken ill. Mrs. Hopland, 74, is in a Tokyo-area hospital now, while Dr. Hopland, 75, who was told he didn't have the virus, remains on board.\n\n\"I was surprised I was negative because I knew the virus had swept through this boat like wildfire,\" said Dr. Hopland. \"My analogy is they put us in a petri dish to get infected.\"\n\nAfter 328 Americans flew back to the U.S. on Monday on U.S. government-chartered cargo jets, the disembarkation of the remaining Diamond Princess passengers is set to begin Wednesday at its docking spot in Yokohama, south of Tokyo.\n\nThe number of infections so far -- 542 as of Tuesday -- represents about one in seven of the 3,700 originally aboard and makes the cruise ship the largest known outbreak site outside of China. Test results for more than 1,000 people remain to be released.\n\n\"My initial assumption was that quarantine cannot be maintained on a boat, and I believe it has been clearly held true,\" said Dr. Hopland.\n\nIn the middle of the quarantine, Dr. Hopland expressed his concern to a friend and fellow medical doctor, Rep. Phil Roe (R., Tenn.). In a call, Dr. Hopland says he told the lawmaker that the crew was working hard to keep passengers well-fed but didn't have the training to carry out a quarantine.\n\nRep. Roe said he spoke to U.S. health officials and they shared his concern that the situation on the ship was exposing passengers to high risk.\n\n\"That was key in getting them evacuated,\" he said in an interview.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry. Sign up.\n\nJapanese officials defended their response as the best under the circumstances, saying it wasn't clear how else the public could be protected and there wasn't any obvious place to send the passengers. They also said they strengthened antivirus measures over time. Initially stewards were handing out food prepared on ship hand-to-hand, but as of Tuesday, a company was preparing the meals outside the ship to prevent infections via food.\n\nKeiichi Ishida, a health ministry official, said if the government had let people who had no symptoms or tested negative leave the ship in the initial days of the quarantine, the outcry would have been even greater because some could be harboring infections. \"You're telling me it would have been OK to have everyone released back then? If so, we'd like to do that next time.\"\n\nMr. Ishida acknowledged the virus has spread somewhat on the ship, but said, \"We succeeded in containing it to a certain degree.\"\n\nSome 60 Americans who tested positive remain behind in Japan, mostly in hospitals. Rep. Roe said U.S. health officials were discussing how those people could be repatriated. Fourteen passengers on the two previous repatriation flights tested positive but had no symptoms and were allowed on the planes.\n\nOnce the quarantine lifts Wednesday, Japan expects to get most remaining passengers off the ship by Friday. Everyone is getting tested for the virus, and those who are negative won't have any restrictions on their movements, Japanese officials said.\n\nStill, most countries are following the U.S. lead and requiring their returning citizens to undergo two additional weeks of quarantine. Countries including Canada, Australia and Italy are sending planes for their citizens. Australia warned its citizens that if they reject the offer of a repatriation flight to Darwin, where they will spend their quarantine, they won't be allowed on other flights to Australia until March 4.\n\nThe U.S. had also urged its citizens to take the government's repatriation flights, which landed at military bases in California and Texas.\n\n\"We don't know how long it lasts on handrails. You don't know that tomorrow you might be positive,\" said Rep. Roe. \"If someone returns on a commercial airliner, you are shedding virus on the plane.\"\n\nDr. Hopland isn't among those who can leave the ship Wednesday. Officials told him he is part of an extended quarantine because he shared a room with his wife, who tested positive.\n\nWhile he wasn't eager to have his cruise stay extended, Dr. Hopland said he understood why. \"I do not wish to go out into the public and spread this virus. I don't know if I have it, but I do believe I could have it.\"\n\nMore China Touts Fall in New Infections Virus Exposes Businesses' Dependency on China U.S. Stocks Fall After Apple Warning Heard on the Street: Apple Isn't Priced for Sick Leave China Plays Are Left Behind in U.S. Stocks' Charge China Turns to Health-Rating Apps to Control Movements During Coronavirus Outbreak China's Real-Estate Market Is Coronavirus Latest Victim What We Know About the Coronavirus\n\nWrite to Suryatapa Bhattacharya at Suryatapa.Bhattacharya@wsj.com and Miho Inada at miho.inada@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Shipping Nears a Standstill Amid Coronavirus Disruption", "body": "Executives say large container ships are leaving Chinese ports as little as 10% full, and sailings are being canceled as carriers brace for a financial retreat By Costas Paris Costas Paris The Wall Street Journal BiographyCostas Paris @CostasParis costas.paris@wsj.com Feb. 14, 2020 12:04 pm ET\n\nShipping volumes out of China are plummeting as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak takes a deeper toll on industrial production, and ocean carriers are bracing for financial blows from the diminished output.\n\n\"Substantially less cargo is being moved between China and the rest of the world\" said Lars Jensen, head of Denmark-based maritime research group Sea-Intelligence. \"Last week we had an additional 30 sailings canceled, with 23 across the Pacific and the rest to Europe.\"\n\nMr. Jensen said the canceled trips, which have topped 50 since late January, will delay or reduce shipments into the U.S., where retailers may see a slowdown in their traditional restocking of inventories for the spring.\n\nFive European and Asian container ship operators told the Journal they are preparing profit warnings for the first half or the full year.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAsking not to be named, senior executives at five European and Asian container ship operators told the Journal that their companies are preparing profit warnings for the first half or the full year.\n\nOcean cargo carriers had been hoping for a rebound in business with the easing of the trade showdown between the U.S. and China.\n\n\"If this continues you will see a sea of red this year. It's really bad,\" said the chief financial officer of a large Asian box-ship company, asking not to be named.\n\nA Shanghai broker said at least one container ship that can move more than 20,000 containers left Shanghai for Northern Europe with only 2,000 full containers.\n\n\"It will pick up more at ports on its way, but loading data show it will reach Europe around 35% full,\" this broker said. \"That's unprecedented, and a lot of money is being lost because it doesn't even cover the fuel cost.\"\n\nSea-Intelligence said in a report this week that more than 350,000 containers have been removed from global trade since the outbreak of the virus led China to impose large travel restrictions at the end of the country's Lunar New Year holiday break.\n\nMORE ON LOGISTICS\n\nCommentary: Supply-Chain Risks From the Coronavirus Demand Immediate Action February 18, 2020 Coronavirus Toll on Shipping Reaches $350 Million a Week February 10, 2020 Parcel, Warehouse Companies Added 20,000 U.S. Jobs Last Month February 7, 2020\n\nCompanies exporting goods into China are also facing problems because only a fraction of workers are back at work to handle goods arriving at ports. That has backed up cargo at terminals and warehouses at big gateways including Shanghai, Tianjin and Ningbo.\n\n\"It [congestion] is due to inbound shipments that have either not been cleared by customs brokers or for which delivery and pick-up services could not be arranged,\" said Resilience360, which monitors risks across supply chains and is owned by Deutsche Post DHL.\n\nA broker in Singapore said there is an \"acute shortage\" of power plugs for refrigerated containers that move fresh produce in Ningbo because there are no workers at terminals. He said some cargo has been diverted from several mainland ports to Hong Kong, which some carriers and shippers are now using as an alternative entry point for goods that are then trucked into China.\n\nA group representing U.S. agriculture exporters warned its members this week to ensure that ocean carriers can store their goods on arrival in China, particularly items like meat, vegetables and fruit that require refrigeration. American exporters are seeing cargo backed up even at U.S. hubs because of the congestion in China's distribution networks.\n\nBrokers said crude and natural gas shipments are down by nearly half across China's main ports. Daily freight rates for big crude tankers have fallen to between $10,000 and $40,000, from up to $80,000 at the start of the year.\n\nNorway-based BW Energy, which operates the world's biggest fleet of gas carriers that move products like propane, this week cut its projected valuation for an initial public offering at the Oslo Exchange from $$700 million to $500 million.\n\n\"The offering period has coincided with significant volatility in the global financial markets due to the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, which has also triggered a material downward movement in the oil price,\" the company said.\n\nThe China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry said more than 200 deliveries of ships under repairs or retrofitting could be pushed back. China is the world's biggest shipbuilder, with more than 960 vessels set to be delivered this year, according to data provider VesselsValue.\n\n\"The Chinese players are facing significant challenges in fulfilling their contracts because they are not able to operate at full capacity after the Lunar New Year holiday,\" the shipbuilding group said.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

An additional 99 people aboard the ship tested positive for the virus on Monday, bringing the total to 454. Beijing is weighing plans to postpone its biggest political assembly as the government races to contain the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nVIEW In Depth\n\nThe trials were first announced on Feb. 5 at Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, one of the main facilities treating coronavirus patients in the city at the epicenter of the outbreak. According to state-run Xinhua News Agency, the plan for the trials is to recruit 761 patients infected with the virus. They are to include 308 patients with mild and moderate symptoms and 452 with severe conditions.\n\nSeverely ill patients had to be within 12 days of the illness's onset and couldn't have taken other treatments within the past 30 days to qualify, according to the screening criteria. Mild and moderate patients who want to join trials needed to be within eight days of the illness's onset. All candidates had to have positive lab results for the infection.\n\nThese criteria have practically ruled out most candidates, since many patients in Wuhan have started taking medication at home -- either those recommended by state media or based on anecdotes they read online while waiting to be admitted to hospitals.\n\nOther patients with apparent symptoms, meanwhile, have received negative results in potentially flawed laboratory tests.\n\nAccording to video footage from Xinhua, Gilead's drug, known as remdesivir, was first administered intravenously on Feb. 6 to a 68-year-old man who had developed severe symptoms and was treated at Jinyintan Hospital. It is unclear whether the patient was given the drug as part of a trial or for emergency use.\n\nZhao Jianping, a doctor at Wuhan Tongji Hospital who is heading a team advising on the treatment of coronavirus patients, said in a Feb. 7 press conference that two-thirds of the severe patients in the trials would be given the drug while the other third would be given a placebo. Those in the placebo group would also receive the standard treatment, Dr. Zhao said.\n\nA Gilead spokeswoman said the two studies, for severe and more moderate cases, were initiated about a week apart and are being conducted by Chinese officials, not Gilead. \"Any questions about the status of those studies would be best addressed by the principal investigator,\" she said.\n\nBeijing pulmonologist Dr. Cao Bin, a prominent researcher deployed to Wuhan to help lead the medical care of patients as well as the two clinical trials, didn't respond to requests for comments.\n\nOther than remedesivir, the antimalarial drug chloroquine and the influenza drug favipiravir have also shown some efficacy in clinical trials, Mr. Zhang of the Ministry of Science and Technology said Saturday.\n\nSun Yanrong, another official at the ministry, said separately on Monday that, based on preliminary clinical trials results, it appeared chloroquine was effective in treating the new coronavirus, with no severe side effects.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry. Sign up.\n\nExperts have suggested including chloroquine, a drug that has been in clinical use for over 70 years, in the next national guidelines for treating the coronavirus, Ms. Sun added.\n\nState-owned pharmaceutical giants China Resources Pharmaceutical Group Ltd. and China Medicine Health Industry Co. are ramping up productions of chloroquine, Zhao Shitang, an official with the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission said today.\n\nFavipiravir has shown better efficacy with fewer side effects in a controlled study against Kaletra, an antiretroviral for HIV made by U.S. pharmaceutical giant AbbVie Inc., Shenzhen No. 3 Hospital in southern China said last week in a statement on its website recommending broader clinical use of the drug. The study was based on 80 patients infected with the new coronavirus, the statement said.\n\nChina's drug authorities last week approved favipiravir, a drug developed in Japan to treat influenza and which has also shown signs of efficacy against the Ebola virus, as a second-line treatment for influenza.\n\nFavipiravir was also approved to be used in clinical trials of the new coronavirus, government data shows.\n\nZhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical had an exclusive licensing agreement with Fujifilm Holdings Co. in 2016, but the patent expired last year, Zhejiang Hisun said in a company filing Monday. Hisun started production of the drug on Sunday.\n\nMore\n\nApple to Fall Short of Projected Revenue Due to Coronavirus Coronavirus Cruise Passengers Land in U.S., Including 14 Infected Coronavirus Outbreak Sets Back China's Biggest Political Assembly Working From Home Tests Employees' Endurance China Defends Coronavirus Measures\n\n-- Fanfan Wang\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It also prompted the removal of officials overseeing the prisons, which are in the coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Shandong and the central province of Hubei, which is at the center of the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nThe health commission of Hubei province on Friday increased its number of confirmed cases after its prison system reported more than 200 cases, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nThe Hubei prison system isn't linked to the infectious-disease online reporting system and most of the 271 infections that it confirmed hadn't previously been included in the province's official count.\n\nTracking the Coronavirus The death toll stands at more than 2,200. In mainland China, more than 75,000 people have been confirmed infected. Three Chinese provinces reported outbreaks at penitentiaries. South Korea reported a jump in new cases, with most linked to a megachurch. What We Know About the Coronavirus\n\nThe cases were diagnosed at two prisons, 230 of them alone at Wuhan Women's Prison, according to He Ping, the head of the national Prison Management Bureau. The warden of the women's prison was removed and a police officer at the second prison was punished for failing to accurately report his travel and interactions, Mr. He said.\n\nIn eastern Shandong province, all but two of Thursday's 202 newly confirmed cases were in Rencheng prison, the provincial government said Friday. The prison warden and the head of the provincial justice department and prison management bureau were fired, along with six other officials, according to Mr. He, who attributed the outbreak there to inadequate prevention and control measures.\n\nThe Communist Party's political and legal affairs commission sent a team to investigate the prison, Xinhua reported.\n\nA prison in Zhejiang, near Shanghai, had 34 confirmed cases of the virus as of Friday, Mr. He said. Two top prison officials there have been removed and prison police were being investigated by local authorities.\n\nMr. He vowed further investigations, on-site inspections, temperature detection and health-tracking systems and timely medical treatment for prisoners.\n\nThe coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, late last year. By the end of Thursday, it had infected 75,465 people and killed 2,235 in mainland China, the country's National Health Commission said Friday.\n\nMost of the infections have been identified in Hubei, but some of the biggest clusters around the region have emerged in places -- like prisons -- that pack people into confined spaces for extended periods.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry. Sign up.\n\nThe largest concentration of cases outside China appeared on a cruise ship docked at Yokohama, Japan, on which more 600 people were infected. In response, Japan, which has more than 90 infection cases unrelated to the ship, has started suspending large public gatherings.\n\nA surge in infections in South Korea, meantime, centers on more than 100 cases connected to a church in the southern city of Daegu.\n\nChina's economy has been hit hard by the virus and the restrictions placed on hundreds of millions of people throughout the country, including the 60 million under quarantine in Hubei, in an effort to contain its spread. A meeting of the Communist Party Politburo emphasized that resuming transportation and getting migrant workers back to work were priorities for ramping economic activity back up, state broadcaster China Central Television reported Friday.\n\nProvinces and cities deemed to be at low risk for spreading the virus were set to fully resume public transit, Xu Chengguang, an official with the Ministry of Transport, said at a news conference earlier in the day, according to Xinhua.\n\nSeparately on Friday, Chinese officials at the Ministry of Science and Technology said a vaccine for the coronavirus, which causes a disease called Covid-19, could be ready for clinical trial as early as late April.\n\nThere are no proven vaccines for the virus, though pharmaceutical giants and teams of university researchers around the world are working on developing one.\n\nMore Japan Defends Handling of Coronavirus-Struck Cruise Ship Two Coronavirus Cruise Ship Passengers Die in Japan Ship Evacuation Set Off Race for U.S. Hospital Beds Life in Lockdown: 'We Can Make It Through This' What We Know About the Virus\n\n-- Xiao Xiao and Fanfan Wang contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Erin Mendell at erin.mendell@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
