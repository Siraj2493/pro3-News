The usual rush after New Year isn't here. A lot of people fear for their jobs with business falling so much.\"\n\nAt least 21 sailings between China and the Americas have been canceled so far, according to Sea-Intelligence, along with 10 cancellations in the Asia-Europe trade loop.\n\nThe cancellations amount to 198,500 containers in the trans-Pacific market, while cancellations between Europe and Asia amount to about 151,500 boxes.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nU.S. retailers depend on those imports to replenish inventories heading into the spring, but the nation's largest retail group is predicting sharply diminished shipping volumes over the next few months.\n\nThe monthly Global Port Tracker report issued Monday by the National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates projects inbound container volumes at U.S. seaports in February will be down 12.9% from a year earlier and off 9.5% in March from a year earlier.\n\nThe report also lowered its forecast for container imports into the U.S. by 370,000 containers over February and March from estimates made before the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"U.S. retailers were already beginning to shift some sourcing to other countries because of the trade war, but if shutdowns continue, we could see an impact on supply chains,\" said Jonathan Gold, the NRF's vice president for supply chain and customs policy.\n\nIHS Markit, a transportation data provider, said in a new report that it expects dry-bulk shipping will be the hardest hit of the shipping sectors because of weak demand from China's factories for raw commodities such as iron ore and coal.\n\n\"The first quarter will likely see a significant drop although a question remains on the extent of demand recovery once the dust settles and in the second half of 2020,\" said Rahul Kapoor, a vice president at IHS Markit.\n\nJie Ming, a crane manager at the Xixia industrial area at the Port of Nanjing, the biggest port on China's Yangtze River, said inbound iron ore shipments were significantly lower over the past three weeks.\n\n\"I've never seen it so slow as this,\" he said.\n\nMore\n\nChina's Shipping Nears a Standstill Amid Coronavirus Disruption February 14, 2020 Parcel, Warehouse Companies Added 20,000 U.S. Jobs Last Month February 7, 2020 Airlines' China Cutbacks Amid Coronavirus Outbreak Squeeze Freight Capacity February 6, 2020\n\nWork at China's shipyards is being delayed on new vessels and for ships that are being fitted with exhaust systems known as scrubbers to meet regulatory requirements for reduced sulfur emissions.\n\n\"We got two ships in Southern China that need to be retrofitted,\" said a Scandinavia-based tanker owner who asked not to be identified. \"They were supposed to be back in the water over the next couple of weeks, but we were told the yard has issued force majeure certificates for eight vessels they are working on, saying the virus will push back deliveries by a minimum three weeks.\"\n\nUnder the legal protections of force majeure, companies can seek to avoid penalties that may come from not fulfilling contracts.\n\nShip broker Clarksons PLC said deliveries of new tankers, bulk ships and container ships would also likely be delayed over the coming months because of the slowdown from the coronavirus.\n\nChinese shipyards have 960 vessels in their order books worth a combined $27 billion, according to VesselsValue Ltd., a London-based maritime service.\n\n\"We are working at around a quarter of our capacity,\" said an executive at China State Shipbuilding Corp., which employs more than 300,0000 workers at various facilities. \"The supply chain for some yards has been seriously impacted. Spares aren't being delivered and engineers are still at home.\"\n\n\"Chinese New Year pushes back work scheduled by up to four weeks. Coronavirus is adding another three weeks of delays,\" he said.\n\n-- Paul Page contributed to this article\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Conspicuous Absence", "body": "Chinese leader acknowledges that some medical workers had 'sacrificed their lives' in fight against epidemic By Jonathan Cheng and Jonathan Cheng The Wall Street Journal BiographyJonathan Cheng @JChengWSJ Jonathan.Cheng@wsj.com Erin Mendell Updated Feb. 10, 2020 1:43 pm ET\n\nBEIJING -- Chinese President Xi Jinping paid his first public visit to the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak, stopping at a Beijing hospital treating infected patients and at a local disease-control office after weeks of remaining largely out of public view.\n\nMr. Xi on Monday visited the office of a neighborhood community center in Beijing's Chaoyang district, where he had his temperature taken by a local staff member, received a briefing on disease-prevention work and waved at families cooped up in their apartments, footage released by state media showed.\n\nLater, he visited Beijing Ditan Hospital, where coronavirus patients in the Chinese capital are being treated. There, Mr. Xi shared a video chat with Wuhan hospitals and heard reports from officials in Hubei province, state broadcaster China Central Television reported.\n\nThe report didn't mention whether Mr. Xi, who was pictured wearing a white lab coat and a surgical mask, met with any patients in person, though state media captured Mr. Xi telling a crowd of well-wishers that there would be no handshakes, given the circumstances.\n\nAt Chaoyang district's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Mr. Xi learned about how the district, on the eastern edge of central Beijing, was coping with the outbreak, CCTV reported.\n\nMr. Xi in his remarks acknowledged that some medical workers had \"sacrificed their lives,\" an apparent indirect reference to a young Wuhan doctor, Li Wenliang, whose death last week triggered an emotional response across the country, much of it frustration directed at officials. Dr. Li had been taken in and interrogated by authorities in early January after warning about the dangers of the deadly new virus, before he contracted it himself.\n\nThe inspection visit comes after weeks in which the virus spread across the country, with other officials appearing at the epicenter in Wuhan to meet with medical workers and patients.\n\nMr. Xi's absence has been conspicuous in recent weeks as his deputy, Premier Li Keqiang, traveled there in January. Mr. Li was also made the head of a new Communist Party \"leading group\" to tackle the outbreak.\n\nTracking the Coronavirus\n\n97 people died in China on Sunday, pushing the death toll to 908. The death toll from the outbreak has now surpassed that of the SARS epidemic nearly two decades ago. China confirmed another 3,062 infections, bringing the total to 40,171.\n\nVIEW In Depth\n\nSun Chunlan, a vice premier and a member of the Communist Party's Politburo who oversees public-health policy, has visited Wuhan at least four times since late January.\n\nMr. Xi appears to have remained mainly in Beijing, staying largely out of view except on a few occasions -- for instance, to meet with World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.\n\nThe number of confirmed infections from the virus known as 2019-nCoV rose to 40,554 globally in 24 countries as of Monday, with 910 deaths. All but 319 cases and one death were in China. Confirmed cases in the U.S. remained at 12 as of Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nMr. Xi's coronavirus inspection on Monday came as China's National Health Commission reported a single-day high of 97 deaths in mainland China on Sunday from the coronavirus.\n\nIt also confirmed 3,062 more cases of infection, while adding that 632 people were released from hospitals, putting the total of discharged patients at 3,281.\n\nThe WHO's Dr. Tedros raised concerns separately on Twitter late Sunday in Geneva about the spread of infection from people who hadn't traveled to mainland China.\n\n\"The detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,\" Dr. Tedros wrote.\n\nA preliminary report by a team including Zhong Nanshan, one of China's most highly regarded epidemiology experts and the leader of a National Health Commission task force on the outbreak, on Sunday said the incubation period for the coronavirus could be as long as 24 days in some cases, though it found that the median time between transmission and the onset of symptoms was three days.\n\nThe study, an unpublished manuscript that hasn't been peer reviewed, was uploaded to the medical website medRxiv on Sunday. Though Dr. Zhong said in an email to The Wall Street Journal that the draft was still being edited, and the incubation-period information may not be included, the preliminary study triggered concern on China's social media that the outbreak could spread more easily, and last longer, than previously expected. Lead author Guan Weijie told domestic Chinese media that the 24-day incubation period was found only in individual cases.\n\nThe study, conducted by Dr. Zhong's team at the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, was based on 1,099 patients from 552 hospitals across the country. An earlier study, based on 425 patients and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found a median incubation period of about five days, with the longest being seven days.\n\nEven so, many governments have coalesced around 14 days for the quarantine of many patients and suspected patients, given research pointing to a maximum two-week incubation period.\n\nAn advance team of experts from the World Health Organization arrived in Beijing on Monday to help with the government's battle against the epidemic.\n\nThe team is meeting with Chinese officials \"to lay the groundwork\" for a larger international team of experts, Dr. Tedros said. He asked Mr. Xi in a meeting two weeks ago to allow an international team of experts to come to China to help with epidemic response and a public-health investigation.\n\nChina's National Health Commission said it would later welcome a larger team of WHO experts, including some from the U.S. Dr. Tedros said the WHO is aiming to send about 10 international experts \"as soon as possible,\" adding that he hopes they have free rein.\n\nRelated\n\nChina Businesses Struggle to Resume Work Evacuees Hunker Down in Quarantine Cases on Cruise Ship Climb to 135 China Inflation Hits Highest in Years Coronavirus Survivor's Cross-China Travel Left Dozens Quarantined China's Leader Wages a War on Two Fronts -- Viral and Political What to Know About the Coronavirus\n\nIn Beijing, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislative body, will add a revision of China's Wild Animal Protection Law onto its agenda this year, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday, in an apparent move to address complaints that the consumption of wild animals had helped the coronavirus spread to humans.\n\nIn coastal Zhejiang province, just south of Shanghai, officials on Sunday called on some districts to lift restrictions on people's movements.\n\nWuhan and surrounding Hubei province, an area of nearly 60 million people at the center of the crisis, have been quarantined. Across China, several local governments, including some far from the center of the crisis, have restricted people's movement.\n\nIn Sichuan province, officials said they are monitoring a fresh outbreak of H5N6 avian influenza, which has killed nearly 2,000 birds, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said. Though avian influenza doesn't spread easily to humans, it is likely to add to the country's economic strain as consumer inflation, largely driven by food prices amid an earlier outbreak of swine fever and the coronavirus, reaches the highest levels in more than eight years. This month, authorities reported a recurrence of H5N1 avian flu in Hunan province.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry.

Six new cases were confirmed on Monday, taking the city's total to 42 cases, one of whom has died.\n\nDozens of residents in a residential complex were evacuated and taken to quarantine centers after two cases were found in apartments 10 floors apart on the same line in one building. While it isn't fully understood how current coronavirus is transmitted, the move was a precaution, said Yuen Kwok-yung, chair professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong's Faculty of Medicine, at a media briefing early Tuesday.\n\nDuring the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, which killed almost 300 people in Hong Kong, hundreds of residents in one residential building got infected because the virus was transmitted through sewage drains.\n\nIn Japan, 65 new cases of the virus were identified aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, bringing the total to 135, the country's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said on Monday. The ship alone has more confirmed cases than anywhere outside mainland China, according to the WHO.\n\n-- Fanfan Wang, Xiao Xiao, Raffaele Huang, Suryatapa Bhattacharya, Betsy McKay and Natasha Khan contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com and Erin Mendell at erin.mendell@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Office towers stayed dark as companies asked employees to work from home. In the few open stores in deserted malls, bored clerks played smartphone games.\n\n\"None of the workers are able to come back for work,\" said Luo Xiaoying, who owns a motorcycle-muffler factory in southern China's Guangdong province. \"Our production has been suspended for almost a month now, and we don't know how long this will last.\"\n\nLoad Error\n\nThe quarantine of nearly 60 million people in Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, the center of the epidemic, means that workers who visited family there over the recent Lunar New Year holiday can't get back to their jobs. Even districts in cities hundreds of miles away such as Hangzhou, home to online retail giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., have confined residents to their homes to try to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nOn top of that, many companies continued to encourage people to continue working from home, even after Shanghai and Beijing officially ended their stay-away-from-the-workplace policy at midnight Sunday.\n\nThese conditions have created a ghost-town ambience across China, where closed and short-staffed businesses have hammered the economy. S&P Global Ratings said Friday that it had lowered its estimate for China's 2020 gross domestic product growth to 5% from 5.7%.\n\nAccounting for nearly 30% of China's gross domestic product is the manufacturing sector. Many factories closed for the Lunar New Year holiday in late January and were set to reopen Monday, only to find a lack of workers and disrupted supply chains.\n\nMs. Luo's muffler plant is in a Guangdong district where local authorities require manufacturers to meet stringent safety requirements to resume work. To reopen, factories must guarantee that workers are coronavirus-free, which potentially means quarantining them for 14 days, and must provide them with protective gear such as masks, goggles and gloves that are hard to buy amid a nationwide shortage. Other areas in China have similar restrictions.\n\nEven when her employees return, Ms. Luo is uncertain whether they can build or sell anything. Her suppliers and clients are also shut. \"The whole supply chain is paralyzed,\" she said. She estimates she could reopen in April and resume full operations in May. \"That means no income for almost half a year,\" she said.\n\nSome bigger companies are reopening more quickly. Ford Motor Co. said it had resumed production at its plants in China on Monday, while General Motors Co. said it would resume production at its plants on Feb. 15.\n\nSome Apple Inc. suppliers are likely to face further delays in restarting mass production, people familiar with the matter said. A challenge for them has been securing factory workers, due to nationwide travel restrictions and policies in certain cities restricting the entry of people from regions where the virus outbreak is severe, the people said.\n\nSuppliers must also take measures to ensure the virus won't spread within their factories. Some suppliers are required by local governments to prepare enough masks, thermometers and disinfectants for workers, and secure space for quarantines in case workers get sick. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRelated video: China's cooling economy poses tough questions for Beijing\n\nMs. Luo said her landlord had given her a grace period to pay rent, and her workers had been understanding about going unpaid during the shutdown.\n\nChinese officials have said the outbreak would increase soured loans. Officials at China's Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said last week that it would slash taxes and urged banks to offer leniency on mortgage and credit-card payments.\n\nIn Shanghai on Monday, where highway traffic remained sparse but still picked up noticeably from recent days, the municipal government said that 70% of manufacturing companies had resumed business.\n\nBut a visit to the city's Songjiang factory district -- home to sites of 3M Co., Dow Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Honda Motor Co., Quanta Computer Inc., Toto Ltd. and Tsingtao Brewery Co. -- suggested many factories were barely operational.\n\nOn many double-wide factory-access roads, it was easier to hear the sounds of birds chirping in Monday's springlike weather rather than of semi-trucks rumbling or factories clanging. Most local restaurants were closed. The workers who did arrive at Songjiang's train station had their temperatures taken at screening areas.\n\nThey also received slips of paper that reminded them to wash their hands after using the toilet and instructed visitors to report if they have had a fever, cough, or shortness of breath, \"especially if you have been in Hubei or in contact with patients from Hubei.\"\n\nIn Hangzhou, a city of 10 million where some residents can go outside to buy supplies only every few days, Alibaba's office employees have worked from home, though the company's couriers have remained on the streets across the country to deliver orders.\n\nIn Beijing, ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. are encouraging employees to work from home until next week. Most employees of search-engine Baidu Inc. are working from home, and those who need to go into the office must get approval.\n\nThe capital city's subways, which are usually standing room only, were mostly empty on Monday. So was China World, a usually packed Beijing office complex and shopping mall. Li Guifang said he often sells more than 100 cups of juice a day at his Original Fresh storefront by an office-tower entrance, but by noon Monday he had sold only two cups -- to two journalists.\n\nHe thought business would pick up later this week. \"I watch short videos on my phone to kill time,\" Mr. Li said.\n\nWrite to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com and James T.

Communist Party secretaries of Hubei province and Wuhan signal Beijing's disapproval of their handling of the outbreak By Stu Woo Stu Woo The Wall Street Journal BiographyStu Woo @stuwoo stuwoo Stu.Woo@wsj.com Updated Feb. 13, 2020 11:19 am ET\n\nBEIJING -- China ousted two top Communist Party officials in Hubei province, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, hours after health officials there confirmed 14,840 new infections on Wednesday alone -- an almost 10-fold increase from a day earlier -- indicating that the epidemic is far from tapering off.\n\nThe high-level firings of the Communist Party secretaries of both Hubei province and its capital of Wuhan, where the contagion is believed to have started last month at a market with live, wild animals, demonstrated Beijing's disapproval of how they handled a threat that has since mushroomed into an epidemic killing more than 1,300 people and halting business across the country.\n\nThe leadership changes also helped to put some distance between the outbreak and the central government in Beijing. News of the sackings spread quickly on Chinese social media, with citizens praising the moves.\n\nChinese state media reported the firings Thursday morning, hours after Hubei's health commission confirmed the surge in new infections. The sharp increase in the infection count was the result of officials in Hubei using a new way to diagnose and track cases of the coronavirus, which causes respiratory illnesses.\n\nThe Latest on the Coronavirus\n\nThe 15th U.S. case was confirmed in Texas. China fired two top Communist Party officials in Hubei province, the outbreak's epicenter. China reported 15,152 newly confirmed coronavirus cases and 254 deaths on Wednesday. The sharp increase in new cases was largely a result of new criteria to diagnose patients in Hubei. TRACKING THE CORONAVIRUS\n\nVIEW In Depth\n\nThe commission previously relied on swab tests, but Wuhan residents who showed symptoms but tested negative questioned their accuracy. Hubei's health commission Thursday began including cases without a positive test result, diagnosing patients through other methods, such as examining their symptoms and X-raying their lungs for illness.\n\nChina's national health commission has reported more than 1,300 deaths and more than 59,000 confirmed infections, including Thursday's latest count from Hubei, during the coronavirus outbreak. More than 5,000 people have been cured and discharged from hospitals.\n\nThe vast majority of the fatalities and infections have occurred in Hubei, a province of nearly 60 million people that has been almost entirely locked down in an effort to halt the virus's spread. Hubei authorities said they were indefinitely delaying the reopening of schools, while telling businesses they shouldn't resume work before Feb. 21.\n\nCities and areas in Hubei -- including Huanggang, a city of 7.5 million people, as well as a district in Shiyan -- instituted the most extreme measures so far, barring all citizens, except for essential personnel, from stepping outside.\n\nAnger swelled in China after local authorities reprimanded Li Wenliang, a young doctor in Wuhan, after he raised alarms about the coronavirus in late December. Dr. Li ended up contracting the virus and died, becoming a national folk hero.\n\nChinese state media said Thursday that Jiang Chaoliang was removed as Hubei province's Communist Party secretary, a position with the equivalent responsibilities of a U.S. governor. He was succeeded by Ying Yong, the mayor of Shanghai and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe 62-year-old Mr. Ying previously held judicial positions in Shanghai and neighboring Zhejiang province, where he worked under Mr. Xi when the future leader was the provincial party secretary. When Mr. Xi ascended to the national leadership, Mr. Ying worked on the president's signature anticorruption campaign that aimed to root out graft. The drive also pulled Communist Party members into allegiance with Mr. Xi.\n\nMr. Ying in 2017 became Shanghai's mayor, a position that has been a steppingstone to higher power because of the Chinese financial capital's importance in international trade and investment. More recently, Mr. Ying was co-director of the leading group for the prevention and control of pneumonia in Shanghai, according to the city government's website.\n\nChina also fired Wuhan's party secretary, Ma Guoqiang, state media said Thursday. He was succeeded by Wang Zhonglin, who had been the party secretary of Jinan, another provincial capital.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry. Sign up.\n\nChinese citizens hailed the leadership changes on the internet. On the social-media platform Weibo, one person supported \"the wise adjustment of the party central committee.\" Another said the moves \"are a little bit late, but it is better than nothing.\"\n\nChinese leaders doled out similar punishments during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, nearly two decades ago, when China's health minister and Beijing's mayor lost their jobs. But in those cases, top Communist Party leaders were largely left in place.\n\nBefore Thursday's firings, the highest-level officials to lose their jobs because of the coronavirus outbreak were the director and Communist Party secretary of Hubei's provincial health commission.\n\nHundreds of other officials have been penalized and dozens were fired for not properly performing their duties during the outbreak, according to a review of Chinese government notices. But most had been lower-ranking, raising questions about how far up the ladder the punishments would go.\n\nBeijing also has taken steps to increase oversight of the crisis. It dispatched Chen Yixin, a former Wuhan Communist Party chief who was serving as secretary-general of the party's powerful Central Political and Legal Affairs Committee, and who is regarded as being close to Mr. Xi, to Wuhan last week to serve as the deputy head of the central guidance team. The team is supervising the local government's work in epidemic prevention and control.\n\nMr. Chen said Wednesday the number of potentially infected people in Wuhan may still be relatively large and there is no accurate estimate of the scale of the outbreak there, according to a posting on social media platform WeChat by the party's political and legal affairs committee Thursday.\n\nIn a separate move, Beijing replaced the head of its Hong Kong policy-making agency with a political veteran with close ties to Mr. Xi, who has demanded fresh efforts to tighten control over the protest-racked city.\n\nThe developments came as United Airlines Holdings Inc. said that it would extend its suspension of flights between the U.S. and Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Hong Kong until April 24.\n\nIn Japan, a woman in her 80s infected with the new coronavirus died Thursday, Japan's health minister said, marking the first known death in Japan related to the virus. The woman was in Kanagawa prefecture, west of Tokyo, and was confirmed to have been infected by the virus after her death, the minister said.\n\n-- Bingyan Wang, Lekai Liu, Xiao Xiao, Wenxin Fan and James T.

An earlier headline incorrectly said they were officials from the Community Party. (Feb. 13, 2020)\n\nWrite to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Chinese diplomats have pitched the crisis as a friendship test, calling on governments not to take measures that would imply Beijing can't contain the epidemic Workers at an airport in Chelyabinsk take part in an exercise to evacuate aircraft passengers showing symptoms of Covid-19 on Feb. 5. Russia has closed land crossings with China. Nail Fattakhov/TASS/ZUMA Press By Chun Han Wong Chun Han Wong The Wall Street Journal BiographyChun Han Wong @ByChunHan chunhan.wong@wsj.com Feb. 14, 2020 7:00 am ET\n\nChina's coronavirus outbreak has sparked fears of a global pandemic -- and sent Beijing's diplomats into overdrive in a bid to keep other countries from adopting measures that imply shortcomings in Chinese efforts to contain the crisis.\n\nWhile Chinese President Xi Jinping assured foreign counterparts that his government is sparing no effort in a \"people's war\" against an epidemic that has killed more than 1,380 people, his foreign minister has worked the phones over the past few weeks, relaying a message of calm and confidence to counterparts and senior officials from more than 20 countries.\n\nIn Beijing and elsewhere, Chinese diplomats have pitched the crisis as a test of friendship, calling on foreign governments not to suspend travel links with China or to evacuate their citizens -- measures Beijing decries as unnecessary, fear-inducing and unfriendly.\n\n\"True friendship emerges in times of adversity,\" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying has repeated in recent weeks.\n\nIt generally hasn't worked. Three of the biggest U.S. airlines -- American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines -- have suspended passenger flights between the two countries, as have the national carriers of France, Britain, Egypt, Qatar and Vietnam, among others. More than a dozen countries have slapped entry restrictions on Chinese nationals or people who have recently been in China.\n\nSealing Borders\n\nAt least 54 jurisdictions have either closed borders or imposed restrictions on Chinese nationals and travelers from mainland China.\n\nITALY\u2020\n\nRussia\n\nU.S.\n\nChina\n\nPakistan*\n\naustralia\n\nITALY\u2020\n\nRussia\n\nU.S.\n\nChina\n\nPakistan*\n\naustralia\n\nITALY\u2020\n\nRussia\n\nU.S.\n\nChina\n\nPakistan*\n\naustralia\n\nITALY\u2020\n\nRussia\n\nChina\n\nPakistan*\n\naustralia\n\nU.S.\n\nNote: Data as of Feb. 13 *Pakistan resumed flights after cancelling for three days. \u2020Italy suspended direct flights; China says Italy agrees to approve some flights; Italy denies they would.\n\nSource: IATA\n\n\"There is still considerable uncertainty about the number of possible cases and the mortality rate of the virus,\" said Ryan Manuel, managing director of Hong Kong-based research firm Official China and an expert on the country's public-health system. \"It is easier to hedge one's bets and shut borders down than to calculate a response based on epidemiological advice.\"\n\nIn recent days, China's Foreign Ministry summoned diplomats from a number of Asian and Western embassies in Beijing to complain about their governments' responses to the epidemic, which have included halting flights and issuing warnings against travel to China, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn these meetings, as well as with other foreign counterparts, Chinese diplomats have reiterated the World Health Organization's guidelines for policy responses to the epidemic, which advises against restrictions on international travel, the people said.\n\nAt a meeting last week with the Italian ambassador, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Qin Gang urged Rome to reverse its decision to suspend direct flights between the two countries, which Mr. Qin described as an overreaction \"that has caused great inconvenience,\" according to a statement from China's Foreign Ministry.\n\nAccording to the Chinese readout, the ambassador replied that Italy was willing to approve some round-trip flights by Chinese airlines -- though Rome later denied that it would allow flights to resume.\n\nAt a meeting last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told senior subordinates that the Foreign Ministry must \"guide various countries to assess the epidemic situation objectively and fairly, and to respond calmly and correctly to the situation,\" the ministry said.\n\nDespite Beijing's pleas, a number of countries -- including governments that China counts as close partners -- have put domestic concerns first.\n\nNorth Korea, whose isolated government counts Beijing as a vital ally, was the first country to seal its border with China in January. Russia, another friend, closed land crossings with China and suspended visa-free travel between the two countries.\n\nThe Latest on the Virus\n\nChina Ousts High-Level Officials as Coronavirus Cases Soar Japan Reports First Death Linked to Coronavirus China's Stimulus Strategy Faces New Test in Virus What We Know, From Symptoms to Treatment\n\nVIEW In Depth\n\nIran cut off air transit with China, while Singapore has denied visas to Chinese nationals -- as well as visitors with recent travel history in China -- and joined more than a dozen other countries in evacuating citizens from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak.\n\nPakistan briefly suspended flights to and from China, resuming them soon after the Chinese Foreign Ministry publicized a phone call between the two countries' foreign ministers in a statement titled: \"Pakistan Stands Firmly with Chinese Brothers Through This Difficult Time.\"\n\nBeijing has reserved the brunt of its criticism for the U.S. and other Western governments. Chinese officials have publicly and repeatedly accused Washington of being unfriendly and even antagonistic for taking steps to close its consulate in Wuhan, and for raising its travel alert for China to the highest level -- \"Do Not Travel\" -- on a par with Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nChinese officials are \"likely responding to what they perceive as insinuation from foreign governments that their system cannot deal with the current challenges,\" said Natasha Kassam, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and a former Australian diplomat.\n\n\"The propaganda machine tends to latch onto foreign criticism as ammunition, but this is mostly about countering popular scrutiny at home,\" she added.\n\nSome countries have stood firmly by China. Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, a staunch supporter of Beijing and recipient of copious Chinese aid, played down health threats from the epidemic and even offered to visit Wuhan during a visit to China last week. Though the Wuhan plan was scuttled by Chinese officials, citing a tight schedule and epidemic controls, Mr. Hun Sen traveled to Beijing, where he was granted an audience with Mr. Xi at Beijing's Great Hall of the People.\n\n\"True friendship emerges in times of adversity, as the Cambodian people stand with the Chinese people at this special moment,\" Mr. Xi told Mr. Hun Sen, Chinese state media reported.\n\nSome critics have accused Beijing of hypocrisy, pointing to its treatment of Mexican citizens during an H1N1, or swine flu, pandemic in 2009. At the time, China forced Mexicans within its borders into quarantine, suspended flights to Mexico and stopped issuing visas to Mexicans -- measures Mexico's government denounced as discriminatory and ungrounded.\n\n\"China never admitted this was wrong, or apologized,\" Jorge Guajardo, Mexico's then-ambassador to China, wrote on Twitter this month.\n\nSome governments have sought to strike a balance between assuaging domestic demands and placating Beijing. Singapore, the Southeast Asian financial center that was hit hard by the 2002-03 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has publicly praised China's efforts to combat the Covid-19 outbreak while imposing border controls of which Beijing disapproves.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nHow useful are border closures and visa restrictions in containing the coronavirus outbreak? Join the conversation below.\n\nA day after China's state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted Singapore's foreign minister telling his Chinese counterpart that the city-state \"admires China's vigorous fight\" against the epidemic, Singapore said in late January that it would suspend issuing visas to Chinese nationals, as well as block visitors who recently traveled in China, making it one of the first foreign governments to adopt such a measure.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry responded by summoning the Singaporean ambassador to convey its displeasure over the new restriction, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSingapore, which is commemorating three decades of diplomatic ties with Beijing this year, has since sought to signal solidarity with China. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and other senior officials expressed praise for Beijing's efforts to contain the epidemic, while donating medical supplies and coronavirus test kits to China. The city-state also allowed the Chinese air force's aerobatics team to perform at the biennial Singapore Airshow this week, after passing health checks.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry.

Street Journal BiographyStu Woo @stuwoo stuwoo Stu.Woo@wsj.com Updated Feb. 14, 2020 9:52 am ET\n\nBEIJING -- Chinese authorities identified 5,090 new coronavirus cases, a new jump in their daily tally that has stirred concerns over the trajectory of the disease and has raised fresh worries over whether China is offering an accurate appraisal of the epidemic's scope.\n\nOn Thursday and Friday alone, China's National Health Commission added about 20,000 newly confirmed cases to its official count, bringing the total number of patients infected by the coronavirus to more than 63,000 people, as of the end of Thursday.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Friday pledged to improve China's epidemic-prevention and public-health systems, according to state-run China Central Television. \"We must fix shortcomings, plug loopholes and strengthen weak links,\" Mr. Xi said.\n\nIn a sign that China remains far from resuming normal life after lockdowns that have shut businesses across the country for weeks, Beijing's municipal government said Friday that people who return to the capital after traveling outside the city must stay at home for 14 days, an official newspaper said.\n\nThe increase in cases came after authorities in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, changed how they diagnosed patients. They had previously relied on lab tests, which scientists said took too long to conduct and could be unreliable. Now, beginning with Thursday's tally report, Hubei is counting patients whose coronavirus infections are confirmed by X-rays of lungs or other means used to clinically diagnose patients.\n\nTracking the Virus China reported 5,090 new cases, raising the overall number of infections to more than 63,000 The number of fatalities rose by 121, the second-highest daily death toll The overall number of people who have died rose to 1,380 More than 1,700 health-care workers in China had contracted the virus as of Feb. 11, and six had died Japan began allowing some people on a quarantined cruise ship to disembark What We Know, From Symptoms to Treatment\n\nVIEW In Depth\n\nSome public-health experts, including Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program, have played down the rapid increase in new cases, saying that the outbreak's general trajectory hasn't changed, and that cases aren't dramatically rising outside China -- with the exception of contagion among people quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan's shore.\n\nThe newly reported cases published on Thursday and Friday \"are probably a backlog of cases over the past few weeks, and do not change our impression of epidemic trajectory in the past week or so,\" Ben Cowling, head of the epidemiology and biostatistics division at Hong Kong University's School of Public Health, said Friday.\n\nRegardless, the sudden jump this week in China's official infection count has raised concerns among senior U.S. officials about whether Beijing had a good grasp on the situation, and whether they were being forthcoming about the seriousness of the epidemic.\n\n\"We're a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese,\" Larry Kudlow, director of the White House's National Economic Council, told reporters Thursday, adding that U.S. experts haven't been allowed into the country despite offering help.\n\nGeng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said in response Friday that \"China has been active and open toward cooperation with the U.S.\"\n\n\"We welcome foreign experts' participation in the China-WHO Joint Mission, including those from the U.S.,\" he added.\n\nIn addition to the jump in new infections, China's National Health Commission on Friday also reported 121 new fatalities from the coronavirus, the second-highest daily total so far, bringing the death toll to 1,380. Several thousand people, it added, have recovered and been discharged from hospitals.\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nAre you confident in China's ability to keep the outbreak under control? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nChinese health authorities also reported for the first time Friday how many health-care workers have been infected by the virus, saying that more than 1,700 health-care personnel had contracted the virus as of Tuesday, and that six had died.\n\nAuthorities said most of these infections occurred when medical personnel were taking fewer precautions at the beginning of the outbreak, which is believed to have started spreading around Hubei's provincial capital of Wuhan late last year. Wuhan hospitals have reported shortages of supplies such as face masks and protective suits.\n\nLi Wenliang, a young Wuhan doctor who became a national folk hero after local authorities reprimanded him for raising alarms about the virus, died last week, triggering an outpouring of emotion, much of it frustration directed at the government.\n\nInternational researchers want more data about infections of medical workers because it would help hospitals around the world prepare for more coronavirus cases. \"What are the ways health-care workers unfortunately got infected?\" the epidemiologist Mr. Cowling said. \"How could other cities in China or other cities outside China prepare their health-care teams better to reduce the risk of infection?\"\n\nIn the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the five labs in the U.S. that handle influenza surveillance will test for the novel coronavirus in patients with flu symptoms if their flu test comes back negative. Those labs are in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City.\n\nOn the treatment front, China National Biotec Group said Thursday it had gotten favorable results treating patients with antibodies, or blood proteins, found in the donated plasma of people who had recovered from the new coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness called Covid-19.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese officials vowed to take steps Friday to help stabilize the economy, after lockdowns have kept tens of millions of people stuck in their homes and unable to resume work at factories and shops that have been shut across the country for weeks.\n\nPeng Lifeng, an official at the People's Bank of China, said Friday that the country's banks must increase lending and lower borrowing rates. Mr. Peng said banks must also increase longer-term credit and loans to small businesses, while clearing red tape to do so quickly.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry.

The Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama, has the most confirmed cases of the virus outside China and still has more than 3,000 passengers and crew on board.\n\nMore Coverage Rise in Cases Raises Questions About Peak The Numbers: How Many People Might One Person Infect?

The situation remains fluid, he added.\n\nThat factory makes large sport-utility vehicles that are mechanically similar to pickup trucks, including the Cadillac Escalade and Chevrolet Suburban.\n\nGM said it doesn't anticipate an impact on truck production as of now.\n\n\"We continue to monitor our supply chain and are in close communications with our Tier One suppliers to mitigate any risk to production in North America,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThe outbreak of the novel disease, which health authorities have named Covid-19, led China's government to impose extended shutdowns of manufacturing plants throughout the country after the traditional Lunar New Year holiday, in hopes of slowing its spread.\n\nAlthough many companies said they planned to restart plants this week, analysts have stressed the impact of supply-chain disruptions, and worker quarantines make it difficult to anticipate when production will return to normal.\n\nThe outbreak has halted assembly lines at several car plants in China. Forecasters at LMC Automotive expect the outbreak to depress Chinese auto production by around 1.2 million cars this quarter. Last year, GM produced nearly 640,000 cars -- nearly 40% of its Chinese production -- in Hubei province, where the outbreak originated and where most of the infections have been diagnosed, the firm said.\n\nThe shutdowns have also affected factories making auto parts and components. Shortages of China-made parts have already started rippling through the global automotive supply chain, leading Hyundai Motor Co. and France's Renault SA to temporarily idle some assembly lines in South Korea.\n\nThe Flint factory is one of GM's largest in the U.S., employing about 5,000 workers. It would likely run out of decals and vents first, both of which can be installed after a near-finished truck rolls off the assembly line, Mr. Fabbro said.\n\nLonger delays could impact more critical components, he said. \"This is going to be a day-by-day monitoring thing,\" he said. \"If it goes six weeks, then we all have bigger problems.\"\n\nGM has arranged for parts to be flown by chartered jet from China when they are available, Mr. Fabbro said. A GM spokesman declined to comment.\n\nGM derives the majority of its global profit from sales of large pickup-trucks and SUVs built in North America. The pickups are built at the Flint factory, along with a plant in Fort Wayne, Ind., and another in Silao, Mexico. The Arlington plant makes all of GM's large SUVs.\n\nGM has been scrambling already to replenish truck stocks after a 40-day strike last fall that shut down production across its U.S. factories.\n\nCar companies have fortified their global supply chains in the years since a tsunami in Japan in 2011 knocked out supplies of certain components and led to cuts in vehicle production across the globe.\n\nWrite to Ben Foldy at Ben.Foldy@wsj.com and Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"Executives say large container ships are leaving Chinese ports as little as 10% full, and sailings are being canceled as carriers brace for a financial retreat By Costas Paris Costas Paris The Wall Street Journal BiographyCostas Paris @CostasParis costas.paris@wsj.com Feb. 14, 2020 12:04 pm ET\n\nShipping volumes out of China are plummeting as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak takes a deeper toll on industrial production, and ocean carriers are bracing for financial blows from the diminished output.\n\n\"Substantially less cargo is being moved between China and the rest of the world\" said Lars Jensen, head of Denmark-based maritime research group Sea-Intelligence. \"Last week we had an additional 30 sailings canceled, with 23 across the Pacific and the rest to Europe.\"\n\nMr. Jensen said the canceled trips, which have topped 50 since late January, will delay or reduce shipments into the U.S., where retailers may see a slowdown in their traditional restocking of inventories for the spring.\n\nFive European and Asian container ship operators told the Journal they are preparing profit warnings for the first half or the full year.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAsking not to be named, senior executives at five European and Asian container ship operators told the Journal that their companies are preparing profit warnings for the first half or the full year.\n\nOcean cargo carriers had been hoping for a rebound in business with the easing of the trade showdown between the U.S. and China.\n\n\"If this continues you will see a sea of red this year. It's really bad,\" said the chief financial officer of a large Asian box-ship company, asking not to be named.\n\nA Shanghai broker said at least one container ship that can move more than 20,000 containers left Shanghai for Northern Europe with only 2,000 full containers.\n\n\"It will pick up more at ports on its way, but loading data show it will reach Europe around 35% full,\" this broker said. \"That's unprecedented, and a lot of money is being lost because it doesn't even cover the fuel cost.\"\n\nSea-Intelligence said in a report this week that more than 350,000 containers have been removed from global trade since the outbreak of the virus led China to impose large travel restrictions at the end of the country's Lunar New Year holiday break.\n\nMORE ON LOGISTICS\n\nChina's Shipping Nears a Standstill Amid Coronavirus Disruption February 14, 2020 Parcel, Warehouse Companies Added 20,000 U.S. Jobs Last Month February 7, 2020 Airlines' China Cutbacks Amid Coronavirus Outbreak Squeeze Freight Capacity February 6, 2020\n\nCompanies exporting goods into China are also facing problems because only a fraction of workers are back at work to handle goods arriving at ports. That has backed up cargo at terminals and warehouses at big gateways including Shanghai, Tianjin and Ningbo.\n\n\"It [congestion] is due to inbound shipments that have either not been cleared by customs brokers or for which delivery and pick-up services could not be arranged,\" said Resilience360, which monitors risks across supply chains and is owned by Deutsche Post DHL.\n\nA broker in Singapore said there is an \"acute shortage\" of power plugs for refrigerated containers that move fresh produce in Ningbo because there are no workers at terminals. He said some cargo has been diverted from several mainland ports to Hong Kong, which some carriers and shippers are now using as an alternative entry point for goods that are then trucked into China.\n\nA group representing U.S. agriculture exporters warned its members this week to ensure that ocean carriers can store their goods on arrival in China, particularly items like meat, vegetables and fruit that require refrigeration. American exporters are seeing cargo backed up even at U.S. hubs because of the congestion in China's distribution networks.\n\nBrokers said crude and natural gas shipments are down by nearly half across China's main ports. Daily freight rates for big crude tankers have fallen to between $10,000 and $40,000, from up to $80,000 at the start of the year.\n\nNorway-based BW Energy, which operates the world's biggest fleet of gas carriers that move products like propane, this week cut its projected valuation for an initial public offering at the Oslo Exchange from $$700 million to $500 million.\n\n\"The offering period has coincided with significant volatility in the global financial markets due to the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, which has also triggered a material downward movement in the oil price,\" the company said.\n\nThe China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry said more than 200 deliveries of ships under repairs or retrofitting could be pushed back. China is the world's biggest shipbuilder, with more than 960 vessels set to be delivered this year, according to data provider VesselsValue.\n\n\"The Chinese players are facing significant challenges in fulfilling their contracts because they are not able to operate at full capacity after the Lunar New Year holiday,\" the shipbuilding group said.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Mr. Durban, the co-CEO of private-equity firm Silver Lake, extended his hand.\n\nMr. Andreessen offered him an elbow instead.\n\n\"We're doing the virtual elbow bump,\" said Mr. Andreessen, co-founder of venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. He explained that his firm had instituted a \"no-handshake\" policy since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Mr. Andreessen then offered his elbow to a Wall Street Journal reporter seated with Mr. Durban.\n\nAround the world the fast-spreading outbreak is prompting a wave of business meeting cancellations, withdrawals from industry conferences -- and a rethink of the most basic form of business etiquette: the handshake. The virus, which has killed more than 1,500 people in China, has spread to more than two dozen countries, including one trail that spread to the U.K. and France from an attendee at a Singapore conference.\n\nAt the Silicon Valley headquarters of Mr. Andreessen's firm, a printed sign warns entering visitors: \"no handshakes please.\" MWC Barcelona, the world's largest telecom conference, had asked its thousands of attendees to adopt a \"no-handshake policy\" at its event this month, before canceling the gathering altogether. The Singapore Airshow, which ends Sunday, called for a \"no-contact policy,\" suggesting \"alternative greetings\" such as bowing or waving.\n\nThe phenomenon shows how the coronavirus outbreak is reshaping life around the world in everyday ways.\n\nWhen Fiona Bae, a public-relations executive, was having drinks with a business contact at an upscale social club in Hong Kong this month, her companion bumped into an old acquaintance. Ms. Bae extended her hand; the acquaintance jerked back.\n\n\"I'm sorry, it's because of the coronavirus,\" Ms. Bae said the stranger told her. \"Frankly, I thought it was a bit extreme,\" she said.\n\nBilal Zuberi, a Menlo Park.-based partner at venture-capital firm Lux Capital, has noticed the trend at board meetings, on company tours and in coffee shops. \"People are avoiding handshakes if possible,\" he said. He has noticed a lot more \"awkward fist bumps\" instead.\n\n\"Elbow bumps for those who think a fist is still exposed skin,\" he said.\n\nRajat Suri, CEO of the Silicon Valley restaurant technology company Presto, welcomes the handshake backlash. Mr. Suri has already made it known to his 160 employees that he declines handshakes, finding the practice \"medieval\" and unhygienic. He prefers a no-contact greeting, such as waving.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nWhat steps do you think businesses should be taking to help prevent the spread of coronavirus? Join the conversation below.\n\n\"There are plenty of cultures around the world that don't shake hands,\" he said, adding that in India, many people clasp their hands and say \"namaste\" as a greeting, and in Japan bowing is common. \"Those cultures get business done all the time.\"\n\nIn mainland China, the etiquette clampdown is far more extreme. At the offices of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, in Guangzhou, employees returned to work last Monday after an extended Lunar New Year holiday, said Harley Seyedin, the chamber's president.\n\n\"No one shook hands,\" Mr. Seyedin said. \"It appeared natural and automatic.\" Everyone wore protective face masks -- now widespread in China -- during all meetings, which are held \"on an absolutely needed basis,\" he said.\n\nWhile the transmission method of the new coronavirus is still not completely understood, respiratory spread of the pathogen is the main channel, said Yuen Kwok-yung, chair professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong's Faculty of Medicine.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry. Sign up.\n\nOne method of transmission, however, could be shaking hands with a person who has respiratory secretions on their hands, Dr. Yuen said at a recent press conference. Shared meals -- a customary way of conducting business in China and many parts of Asia -- could also pose a risk if respiratory droplets spread to utensils. On Feb. 9, officials in Hong Kong reported nine new cases of the virus from a single family that had shared a hot-pot and barbecue meal in late January.\n\nFomites -- inanimate objects that can transfer viruses -- have long been a target when tackling infectious diseases. In the wake of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003, elevators across the city were posted with assuring notes of being disinfected hourly.\n\nEdison Lee, an analyst at the investment bank Jefferies in Hong Kong, recalled that residents avoided handshakes during the SARS epidemic which killed almost 300 people in the city. \"But I feel that the level of fear now is more than during SARS, likely because we are more prepared and alerted given the SARS experience.\" Hong Kong has confirmed dozens of cases of the new coronavirus, recording one death.\n\nTim Hwang, a longtime San Francisco resident and tech policy analyst who circulated an image online of the no-handshakes sign posted at Andreessen Horowitz, is skeptical. He called no-handshake policies \"one of these magical practices that we adopt to make ourselves feel better.\"\n\n\"We don't know what to do, so we're going to recommend we do some kind of arbitrary thing as kind of a talisman against the disease,\" he said in describing the policy.\n\nOn Twitter, Mr. Andreessen last week fired off a stream of \"public service announcements\" including an 11-step instruction guide to proper hand-washing technique and warnings about the public-health risks of handshakes.\n\n\"I was at a conference in L.A. a couple of weeks ago. There was a remarkable willingness among people to not shake hands,\" said Presto's Mr. Suri. \"I think everybody should be thrilled to see this go.\"\n\nRelated\n\nChina Defends Coronavirus Measures as France Reports First Death Selling Frozen Dumplings, Cutting Pay: Chinese Businesses Struggle to Survive Coronavirus U.S. to Repatriate Some Americans From Coronavirus Cruise Ship What We Know About the Coronavirus, From Symptoms to Treatment\n\n-- Natasha Khan contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com and Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

and disrupted supply chains in the world's second-largest economy. But U.S. stocks have held close to records.\n\nThe market's resilience stands in contrast to how quickly the epidemic has spread and how difficult it has been to assess the accuracy of information coming out of China, money managers say.\n\n\"We're surprised at how sanguine the market is,\" said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s private wealth-management group, adding that \"realistically, the data are very, very uncertain.\"\n\nIndex performance, year to date\n\n8\n\n%\n\nNasdaq Composite\n\n+8.2%\n\nChina reports second death from outbreak\n\nS&P 500\n\n4\n\nStoxx Europe 600\n\nDow industrials\n\nNikkei Stock Average\n\n0\n\nFTSE 100\n\nHang Seng Index\n\n-4\n\nShanghai Composite\n\n-4.7%\n\n-8\n\nFeb. 3*\n\nDec. 31\n\nJan. 17\n\nJan. 31\n\nFeb. 13\n\n*China's stock market was closed Jan. 24-31.\n\nSource: FactSet\n\nIndex performance, year to date\n\n8\n\n%\n\nNasdaq Composite\n\n+8.2%\n\nChina reports second death from outbreak\n\nS&P 500\n\n4\n\nStoxx Europe 600\n\nDow industrials\n\nNikkei Stock Average\n\n0\n\nFTSE 100\n\nHang Seng Index\n\n-4\n\nShanghai Composite\n\n-4.7%\n\n-8\n\nFeb. 3*\n\nDec. 31\n\nJan. 17\n\nJan. 31\n\nFeb. 13\n\n*China's stock market was closed Jan. 24-31.\n\nSource: FactSet\n\nIndex performance, year to date\n\n8\n\n%\n\nNasdaq Composite\n\n+8.2%\n\nChina reports second death from outbreak\n\nS&P 500\n\n4\n\nStoxx Europe 600\n\nDow industrials\n\nNikkei Stock Average\n\n0\n\nFTSE 100\n\nHang Seng Index\n\n-4\n\nShanghai Composite\n\n-4.7%\n\n-8\n\nFeb. 3*\n\nDec. 31\n\nJan. 17\n\nJan. 31\n\nFeb. 13\n\n*China's stock market was closed Jan. 24-31.\n\nSource: FactSet\n\nIndex performance, year to date\n\n8\n\n%\n\nNasdaq\n\nComposite\n\n+8.2%\n\nS&P 500\n\n4\n\nStoxx Europe 600\n\nDow industrials\n\nNikkei Stock\n\nAverage\n\n0\n\nFTSE 100\n\nHang Seng Index\n\n-4\n\nShanghai\n\nComposite\n\n-4.7%\n\n-8\n\nFeb. 3*\n\nDec. 31\n\nJan. 17\n\nJan. 31\n\nFeb. 13\n\n*China's stock market was closed Jan. 24-31.\n\nSource: FactSet\n\nMarkets had initially lost ground after officials reported the outbreak had spread beyond China's borders. The S&P 500 dropped 3% between Jan. 23 and Jan. 31, while the Stoxx Europe 600 lost 2.2% over the same period. China's Shanghai Composite Index dropped 7.7% on Feb. 3, its steepest one-day decline in more than four years, after reopening following the Lunar New Year.\n\nJust weeks later, though, markets have managed to claw back much, if not all, of their losses.\n\nCompanies that were among the worst-hit by coronavirus-related selling last month have recovered in recent days. Wynn Resorts Ltd. owns a luxury casino resort in Macau, where officials have asked operators to suspend operations for now. Its stock gained 4.1% for the week -- outperforming the S&P 500, which rose 1.6%.\n\nYum China Holdings Inc. operates KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants across China. Its stock added 5% for the week.\n\nEven commodities prices have stabilized after an initial rout. Copper, which many investors view as a gauge for global economic activity, posted its biggest one-week price gain since December.\n\nThe rally has divided money managers and analysts. Some believe the market rebound is justified, pointing to research showing the long-term impact of prior outbreaks has been muted and a sense that the epidemic is being contained effectively. Others are less convinced.\n\n\"We have to remember that stock markets are not particularly good at pricing in these types of risks,\" said Dario Perkins, managing director of global macro at market-research company TS Lombard.\n\nMuch of the market's rebound appears to have been fueled by relief over Chinese officials unleashing a wave of spending to help relieve the pressure on the Chinese economy, analysts and investors say.\n\nThe People's Bank of China deployed 1.7 trillion yuan in open-market operations on Feb. 3 and 4. Not coincidentally, many global stock indexes bottomed out around then. The Shanghai Composite rose every single trading day from Feb. 4 to Wednesday, logging its longest streak of consecutive gains in more than a year. The S&P 500 has also pared losses, closing Friday up 4.6% for the year and at a record.\n\n\"When you have the announcement from Beijing that they'll be injecting fiscal and monetary stimulus, the expectation is that they'll continue to do so until they see the economy rebound,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Inc.\n\nEvidence that Beijing is willing to roll out further stimulus has been reassuring to many money managers, especially since the fate of the global economy has become intertwined with that of the Chinese economy. China accounts for almost a fifth of global domestic product when adjusted for incomes, according to the International Monetary Fund, meaning slowdowns there have the potential to cast a pall over the rest of the world.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has sickened tens of thousands of people world-wide, strained China's medical system and disrupted supply chains at multinationals ranging from Apple Inc. to General Motors Co.\n\nSo far, though, economists believe the long-term impact of the epidemic will likely be relatively muted. Among S&P 500 companies, just 5.8% of sales are generated from China, compared with 62% from the U.S., according to FactSet.\n\nGlobally, Goldman Sachs economists have shaved 2 percentage points off their estimate for first-quarter growth, citing expectations for weaker growth in China, less spending among Chinese tourists and a drop-off in Chinese imports. But they believe economic activity will likely recover at least partially in the following quarters.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nIs the global stock market showing resilience or just setting itself up for another downturn? Why? Join the conversation below.\n\nThose who worry the market's rebound might not be on the sturdiest ground caution that such projections assume that the outbreak will be contained in the coming months, that central bank stimulus will be enough to offset a slide in manufacturing activity and spending, and that the trajectory of the current coronavirus epidemic will be similar to prior outbreaks. Those assumptions might not necessarily turn out to be true, TS Lombard's Mr. Perkins said.\n\n\"How many basis points [of interest-rate cuts] does it take to control a global epidemic?\" he said. Mr. Perkins added that he questions the accuracy of data on the outbreak coming out of China.\n\nLingering skepticism hasn't stopped the market from rallying, though.\n\nNancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments, said her company is still invested predominantly in U.S. stocks, based on the belief that the domestic economy is strong enough to withstand unexpected shocks like the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nData have shown U.S. employers continuing to hire at a steady clip, corporate profits coming in better than analysts had expected and consumer spending looking solid.\n\n\"What people are counting on is that [the outbreak] will be containable,\" Ms. Tengler said.\n\nMarkets in Your Inbox\n\nGet our Markets newsletter, a pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas.

EPA/Shutterstock By Chao Deng Chao Deng The Wall Street Journal BiographyChao Deng @chao_deng chao.deng@wsj.com Feb. 14, 2020 4:50 pm ET\n\nWUHAN, China -- Local Communist Party representative Xiao Lifang has been working nearly nonstop since the outbreak of a deadly virus here, helping to figure out who needs to be quarantined or hospitalized, checking temperatures, and delivering food and medicine to the thousands of residents she oversees.\n\n\"Everything is dumped on the shequ,\" she said, using the Chinese word for community committee. \"We're not doctors.\"\n\nA legacy of the Mao era, community committees serve as the government's neighborhood watchdogs, carrying out Communist Party mandates, resolving disputes and maintaining grass-roots social order. But they have been thrust to the front line of the fight against the coronavirus that has infected nearly 36,000 in Wuhan and overwhelmed local officials and the health-care system in this city of 11 million.\n\nMs. Xiao and her team of nine workers have worked in shifts around the clock at a spartan office to assist 3,700 people living in the Golden Dragon Garden residential complex. They have comforted family members, delivered vegetables, arranged car rides, and answered the constant phone calls from residents who need help.\n\nOn Friday, she stood outside her office in a thick hooded, knee-length coat and a surgical mask, describing the worst moments of the outbreak. \"This ear hurt,\" she said, pointing to her right side. \"My arm didn't have enough strength to hold up the phone. I had to charge my phone again and again.\"\n\nMs. Xiao and her team have kept temperature records for all of the residents. They have also made in-person visits to peoples' apartments, even as they were unsure if they themselves could get infected with the virus.\n\nThe virus has now infected more than 63,000 people across China and killed at least 1,380. The majority of cases have been in Wuhan's surrounding province of Hubei. The number of documented infections in the province jumped by more than 18,000 on Wednesday and Thursday after authorities adopted a broader diagnosis classification.\n\nStraining to keep up, the government has added thousands of beds by opening treatment centers and repurposing hotels as quarantine centers. It has tasked community committees with categorizing and isolating residents in different facilities depending on the severity of their exposure.\n\n\"No one should be left behind,\" the province's outbreak response team said last week after announcing the new policy. Residents who didn't comply would face legal punishment, it added, without offering specifics.\n\nFamilies have chafed at having overworked committee staff involved in making health-care decisions.\n\nAt a different apartment complex in Wuhan's Chezhan neighborhood, the residential committee first decided to quarantine Zhu Qingmei at a hotel without medical care, she said, even though she was so sick that she had trouble breathing.\n\nAs the 55-year-old's illness worsened and she was confirmed to have the virus, Ms. Zhu asked to be admitted to a hospital. Her residential committee instead arranged for her to go to a convention center that had been turned into a field hospital for patients with milder symptoms.\n\nMs. Zhu waited for hours at the back of a pickup truck at the field hospital's entrance before medical staff inside found out her blood oxygen levels were dangerously low and sent her to a hospital that specialized in ear, nose and throat care. She spent two days there before finally being transferred to a hospital designated to treat the coronavirus.\n\n\"It was like they just wanted to finish their task,\" she said. \"When I came out of the field hospital, it was like I lost half my life. I couldn't speak and breathing was difficult.\"\n\nThe Chezhan district committee, which oversees Ms. Zhu's apartment complex, declined a request for an interview. A spokeswoman for the committee said some cases might have been mismanaged, but only because officials were overwhelmed.\n\nHealth officials worry that the overburdened system is exposing healthy people to the virus.\n\nEarlier this month, one residential committee accidentally sent a confirmed case for quarantine to a hotel that was meant only for people who had been in close contact with virus patients. A driver assigned by the committee, who was wearing only a surgical mask for protection, had picked up a mother who had been infected, instead of her daughter who didn't have symptoms.\n\n\"It's such a mess,\" said Mr. Xia, a district health commission officer who was on duty at the hotel. He declined to give his first name. \"It's going to get others infected.\"\n\nThe city fired the director of one district committee for mismanaging dozens of critically ill patients, according to the city's party-run Changjiang Daily newspaper. It reprimanded and gave a disciplinary warning to two others, one of them for mistakenly sending severely-ill patients to the wrong hospital. Officials \"should make disease prevention the most important political task,\" it said.\n\nAt the Golden Dragon community, one resident took to the social-media platform Weibo to complain that the committee had refused to quarantine her and her husband, who were both sick. \"The virus isn't scary so much as people's intentions,\" she wrote. \"Do you want to quarantine me or have me die?\"\n\nThe committee later arranged for the resident's husband, 44-year old Xu Weijie, to move to a hotel for monitoring and quarantine.\n\nThe Latest on the Virus\n\nFear and Boredom Aboard the Quarantined Coronavirus Cruise Ship What We Know About the Coronavirus China Sees Second Straight Jump in Virus Infections China Urged Open Borders. Even Allies Are Resisting.\n\nVIEW In Depth\n\nWhile admitting to struggles, community committees said they had assisted many in need. There has been progress, with nearly 1,500 seriously-ill coronavirus patients getting admitted to hospitals in a matter of two days, Wuhan's former Communist Party secretary, Ma Guoqiang, said earlier this week.\n\nReinforcements have recently begun to arrive as the government brings in workers from state-owned enterprises and volunteers to help.\n\nIn Golden Dragon, about 40 residents have come down with fevers since the outbreak began, according to the community committee. Roughly half had regular colds while another 10 were confirmed to have the virus that causes Covid-19 and put in hospitals. Nine other suspected cases were either put in hospitals or transferred to hotels for testing.\n\nMs. Xiao said she started her job on the committee nearly two decades ago, not long before China suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. This outbreak has felt more serious, she said. Hubei registered only seven infections and one death from SARS in 2003.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry. Sign up.\n\nMs. Xiao, the committee's party secretary, said she is in touch with every sick patient through WeChat, a popular Chinese app, and her team rejoices each time an infected resident is able to secure a hospital bed.\n\nLooking back, she said, she's not sure how she and her team got through the previous weeks. Trying to contain the outbreak has been grueling and terrifying, according to Ms. Xiao, who said she typically doesn't get home until midnight. After walking in the door, she sprays her clothes down with alcohol and takes a shower, worried she'll bring the virus back to her family.\n\nShe said she has noticed a change among residents recently. There is less fear, and the discussions in the WeChat group are starting to return to the mundane topics of everyday life, like how to bake cakes and cook pizza.\n\nStill, she feels the battle against the virus is far from over. \"I'm scared to be optimistic,\" she said.\n\n-- Kersten Zhang contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

CCL -1.39%\n\nCruise companies are experiencing turbulence as the coronavirus epidemic spreads. More than 170 passengers aboard Carnival's Diamond Princess cruise ship have caught the virus, causing about 3,700 passengers and crew to be quarantined for two weeks. Carnival has canceled February cruises on four Costa Cruises ships in China as well as 12 sailings of the Diamond Princess in Japan, and said the virus could weigh on global demand for cruises. Shares fell 2% Thursday.\n\nT-Mobile TMUS 1.41% US Inc.\n\nT-Mobile's takeover of Sprint Corp. will test the idea that three giants in the U.S. wireless market will compete as effectively as four did. A federal judge approved the deal, worth $26 billion when it was struck two years ago, and concluded that the merger wasn't likely to substantially lessen competition. The two companies spent more than seven years pursuing a combination before striking an agreement in 2018 that would create a company closer in size to Verizon and AT&T. Dish will become the fourth major carrier, acquiring airwaves and about nine million customer accounts from Sprint. T-Mobile shares gained 12% Tuesday.\n\nRestaurant Brands International Inc.\n\nThe wildly-popular Popeyes chicken sandwich is now outperforming other fast-food mainstays produced by its own parent company. Restaurant Brands said Monday that higher revenue in the fourth quarter was driven by gains from Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen while its Burger King and Tim Hortons chains reported weaker-than-expected sales. Tim Hortons introduced Beyond Meat Inc. plant-based sandwiches last year but recently pulled them after they failed to stir up sales, while Burger King's national rollout of the plant-based Impossible Whopper wasn't enough offset the chain's weakness during the quarter. Shares gained 3.2% Monday.\n\nAlphabet Inc. GOOG 0.40%\n\nGoogle is tangling once again with the European Union's antitrust enforcer. The Alphabet subsidiary told a Luxembourg court Wednesday that European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager had no legal grounds for awarding a multibillion fine for allegedly abusing its dominance over smaller rivals. In 2017, she found that Google stacked the deck in favor of its own comparison-shopping service. A verdict isn't expected until early next year, but the litigation is a test case for Ms. Vestager and the continuing probes into Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Alphabet shares gained 0.6% Wednesday.\n\nBarclays BCS -0.77% PLC\n\nBarclays Chief Executive Jes Staley is facing scrutiny of his professional ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and convicted sex offender who died in jail last year. The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority is examining how Mr. Staley characterized their relationship to Barclays and how the British lender described it to the regulator, Barclays said Thursday. Mr. Staley told reporters his interactions with Mr. Epstein began in 2000 and \"tapered off\" in 2013, with their last interaction taking place during 2015. In 2008, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. American depositary shares of Barclays fell 0.7% Thursday.\n\nMattel Inc.\n\nEven \"Toy Story 4\" couldn't save Mattel's holiday sales. Growth in its larger brands, such as Barbie and Hot Wheels, wasn't enough to offset weakness for Fisher-Price and American Girl products during the fourth quarter. Toy makers had to contend with a shorter holiday shopping period in 2019 as they continue to adjust to the absence of Toys \"R\" Us Inc. Mattel also said earlier this week it has closed two factories in Asia and plans to close one in Canada as the company reduces its sprawling manufacturing footprint to reduce costs. Mattel shares fell 3.1% Friday.\n\nYelp Inc. YELP -3.48%\n\nYelp's latest performance is getting poor reviews from investors. The online listings company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales Thursday and named a new finance chief as it faces pressure to improve its financial performance. Best known for its reviews of restaurants and other local services, Yelp has been pushing to develop other business lines such as offerings for restaurant operators. In September, the company said it added new features allowing restaurateurs to reach consumers by sharing information on users' Yelp home screens. It also rolled out a feature predicting wait times at restaurants. Yelp shares fell 3.5% Friday.\n\nWrite to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
