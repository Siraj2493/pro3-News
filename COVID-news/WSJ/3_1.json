CCL -14.14% cruise ship has become embroiled in an outbreak of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus -- this time in a West Coast-based liner called the Grand Princess where health officials say at least one former passenger has died after a recent cruise.\n\nThe ship, on a two-week voyage to Hawaii with a stop in Mexico, has been ordered to return to port in San Francisco. The vessel has a capacity of 2,600 guests and 1,150 crew. It left San Francisco on Feb. 21 and was originally scheduled to return March 7.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said late Wednesday the cruise ship won't be allowed to come ashore until state officials appropriately assess the passengers and the vessel. \"It's a dynamic situation,\" Mr. Newsom said in a press briefing.\n\nHigh-Speed Trains, International Flights: How the Coronavirus Spread\n\nOfficials of Carnival's Princess Cruises said in a letter early Wednesday to passengers that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had notified them it was investigating \"a small cluster\" of Covid-19 cases in Northern California tied to the same ship's voyage in February between San Francisco and Mexico.\n\nThe company, the world's biggest cruise operator, also operates the Diamond Princess, where dozens of passengers became infected with Covid-19 when it docked in Japan in January. That ship was quarantined for two weeks.\n\nAn elderly passenger from the Feb. 11-21 Mexico cruise became the first person in California to die from the illness, after being hospitalized in Placer County, Calif., following likely exposure on the trip, health officials said Wednesday.\n\nMr. Newsom said another passenger from Sonoma County, Calif. is in a \"difficult condition\" and being monitored for possible Covid-19 complications.\n\nRelated\n\nCoronavirus Leaves Cruise Industry With Canceled Trips and Half-Empty Ships Coronavirus Spreads in California, New York as U.S. Death Toll Rises to 11\n\nPlacer County officials said other cruise passengers may also have been exposed, and that they were working with the CDC to find and alert them. Mr. Newsom said several of those people from Placer County were part of a tour.\n\nOn Princess Cruises's website, Chief Medical Officer Grant Tarling advised guests on the February cruise to immediately seek medical attention if they have experienced any symptoms of the virus, including fever, chills or cough since returning home.\n\nDr. Tarling said in an open letter that the Grand Princess, until today en route to Ensenada, Mexico, about 100 miles south of the U.S.-Mexican border, would turn around and return to San Francisco for further investigation.\n\nPassengers were told to remain in their staterooms until they had been cleared by medical staff. \"You may order room service while you wait for the medical screening to be completed, and we apologize for any inconvenience,\" Dr. Tarling said in the letter.\n\nCoronavirus\n\nLive Updates\n\nWhat We Know\n\nHow to Prepare\n\nBreaking Down the Costs\n\nTravel Q&A\n\nThe company said 62 passengers who sailed the previous Mexico voyage remained on board for the current Hawaii voyage.\n\n\"In an abundance of caution, these guests and other potential close crew contacts have been asked to remain in their staterooms until screened by our onboard Medical team,\" the company said.\n\nThe company said it was taking precautionary onboard measures, including disinfecting major traffic areas and barring passengers from serving themselves from the buffet.\n\nPrincess Cruises gained fame in the 1970s when one of its ships, the Pacific Princess, was cast in a starring role in the television series, \"The Love Boat.\"\n\nThe Grand Princess, launched in 1998, was refurbished last year. On its February trip from San Francisco to Mexico, the ship passed Cabo San Lucas on Valentine's Day.\n\nThe cruise director dressed in a red suit with white hearts joined the ship's captain to perform wedding vow renewals for dozens of couples, according to a passenger video posted online.\n\nPassengers enjoyed live entertainment, including a production of a show called \"British Invasion\" and \"Stardust,\" a Blues Brothers tribute band.\n\nTravelers are backing out of planned cruises over fears of the spread of coronavirus, dealing a punishing blow to the industry at a time of year when ships typically start to fill up.\n\n-- Erin Ailworth contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nThe Diamond Princess is the name of the ship where dozens of passengers became infected with Covid-19 when it docked in Japan in January.

After yesterday's vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden,\" he said. \"I will work to make him the next president of the United States.\"\n\nHis endorsement is the latest in a string of successes for Mr. Biden, the former vice president, who picked up the backing of three other ex-rivals for the Democratic nomination before Super Tuesday.\n\nMr. Bloomberg called Mr. Biden Wednesday, according to a campaign aide for the former mayor, who said they had a \"great conversation.\"\n\nMr. Bloomberg announced his decision in a senior staff meeting on Wednesday. An email was then sent out to all staffers, followed by a staff call with campaign manager Kevin Sheekey and states director Dan Kanninen, according to the aide.\n\nThe former New York City mayor had earned just a few dozen delegates by Wednesday, as they were still being allocated, after spending $215 million on TV and radio ads in the 14 states that voted. The only contest he won was in American Samoa. Mr. Bloomberg is expected to address his staff and supporters at an event in New York City Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMr. Bloomberg pitched himself as a nonideological executive focused on beating President Trump, with the slogan \"Mike Will Get It Done\" and his seemingly limitless resources. In the days before the polls opened in Super Tuesday states, Mr. Bloomberg pointed to the administration's handling of the coronavirus outbreak to argue that he would be a more competent leader, spending $1.5 million on a prime-time, three-minute ad on two television networks.\n\nOverall, Mr. Bloomberg, who is worth $62 billion, spent at least $620 million to build a massive campaign operation of more than 2,400 people across the country and to blanket the airwaves and digital platforms.\n\nBefore dropping out, he had insisted for days that he was \"in it to win it,\" while acknowledging that the only path for him to secure the Democratic nomination was through a contested convention.\n\nMr. Bloomberg had committed to keeping his organization even if he left the presidential race, saying he would pivot it toward helping the Democratic nominee and beating Mr. Trump. On Wednesday, following his endorsement of Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg's advisers were still figuring out how that commitment would shape up.\n\nRelated\n\nBiden, Sanders Look to Next Contests as Bloomberg Exits Warren Loses Primary in Home State Top Takeaways From Super Tuesday Where the Race Goes From Here Tracking the Delegate Counts\n\n\"Mike has always said he would put all of his resources in defeating Trump and has never shied away from tough battles,\" said Tim O'Brien, senior adviser for the campaign. \"He deeply admires Joe Biden and will back his candidacy to the fullest extent.\"\n\nMr. Bloomberg launched his campaign in late November after growing concerned about the rise of liberal Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. His advisers pointed to polling at the time that showed former Vice President Joe Biden, the most prominent moderate Democrat in the 2020 field, was within the margin of error in hypothetical matchups with Mr. Trump. Other candidates, they believed, would lose in the November election.\n\nMr. Bloomberg skipped the first four nominating contests because of his late entry, banking on the delegate-rich Super Tuesday states. And after Mr. Biden suffered big losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Bloomberg appeared to have an opening.\n\nBut late in February came Mr. Biden's landslide victory in South Carolina, and the former vice president won the endorsements of three former presidential candidates. Mr. Biden ended up racking up delegates on Super Tuesday, crushing Mr. Bloomberg and other contenders in several states.\n\nThe former mayor's reasoning for entering the race was shattered by Mr. Biden's string of victories, leaving Mr. Bloomberg with no choice Wednesday morning but to drop out, according to people familiar with his decision-making.\n\nBased on its internal data, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign saw a big shift after South Carolina, according to a campaign aide. In states where many people voted early or by mail, such as Colorado and Utah, Mr. Bloomberg performed better.\n\nMr. Bloomberg's momentum going into Super Tuesday was also blunted after he suffered one abysmal and one mediocre debate performance. The three-term New York mayor was grilled on the debate stage, in interviews and on the campaign trail about stop-and-frisk, a policing practice that his administration enforced and that a federal judge ruled was unconstitutional for violating the rights of minorities.\n\nMr. Bloomberg apologized for the practice before launching his White House bid and continued to do so during his campaign, including when audio of him staunchly defending the practice surfaced.\n\nHe also saw criticism over allegations of inappropriate comments toward women who worked for him at Bloomberg LP. Ms. Warren hammered him during the first Democratic debate for signing nondisclosure agreements with some of those women. Two days later, Mr. Bloomberg announced he would release three women who had made complaints against him from their agreements.\n\nWrite to Tarini Parti at Tarini.Parti@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"By Nick Timiraos Nick Timiraos The Wall Street Journal BiographyNick Timiraos @NickTimiraos Nick.Timiraos@wsj.com Updated March 3, 2020 5:35 pm ET\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve executed an emergency half-percentage-point rate cut and markets slid, reflecting fears the coronavirus epidemic is raising recession risks for the U.S. and global economies.\n\nThe Fed reduced the federal-funds rate to a range between 1% and 1.25% in the first rate change in between scheduled Fed policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. Stock markets fell anyway. Major market indexes declined around 3% and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury dipped below 1% for the first time as investors sought havens.\n\nThe central bank has typically reserved such moves for times when the economic outlook has quickly darkened, as in early 2001 and early 2008, when the U.S. economy was heading into recession.\n\nRecession risks have risen enough to \"warrant a Federal Reserve shock-and-awe approach,\" said Tiffany Wilding, an economist at Pacific Investment Management Co.\n\nThe market's moves Tuesday showed the extent to which investors worry the central bank can't on its own prevent a dropoff in confidence and spending without a commanding response from public-health authorities and other government agencies.\n\nThe rate cut was approved unanimously by the Fed's rate-setting committee, which met by videoconference on Monday night. In a statement, officials held out the prospect of additional stimulus by pledging to \"act as appropriate\" to support the economy.\n\nFed officials moved to prevent a pullback in credit availability to households and businesses that could amplify any slowdown in U.S. growth, especially if steps to mitigate the spread of the virus -- school and business closures, canceled public events and social behavior broadly speaking -- curtail spending and depress hiring.\n\n\"The virus and measures being taken to contain it will weigh on economic activity here and abroad for some time,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a hastily arranged news conference on Tuesday.\n\nThe Fed's response shows how policy makers are bracing for greater economic distress from a contagious, flulike virus than seemed possible just a week ago.\n\nIn China, where nearly 3,000 people have died since the initial outbreak there, steps to contain its spread prompted steep declines in production. The coronavirus has infected more than 10,000 people outside China since an initial outbreak there.\n\nThe epidemic roiled global financial markets last week amid signs containment efforts were jeopardized by new clusters in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Stocks posted their largest weekly losses since the 2008 financial crisis. Commodity prices tumbled, signaling a hit to global demand, and long-term U.S. government-bond yields reached record lows, reflecting lower growth expectations and investors seeking havens.\n\n\"The concern was that by the time they got to the meeting, things could have spiraled far enough that they would have a much bigger problem,\" said William English, a former senior Fed economist who now teaches at Yale University, referring to the Fed's scheduled March 17-18 policy meeting.\n\nPositive test results for infections in the U.S. last weekend further raised the prospect of changes to behaviors that could lead to a drop in consumer spending, especially travel, tourism and entertainment.\n\nEven if any shock is temporary, there are big unknowns over how long it will last and how deep output might decline. While an interest-rate cut won't address the cause of the downturn, Mr. Powell said he hoped it could soften damage to spending and confidence, stem financial-market disruptions and speed a recovery once any epidemic is under control.\n\n\"A rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that,\" Mr. Powell said. \"But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy.\"\n\nWhen the Fed cut rates three times last year, officials characterized those moves as an insurance policy against the risk of a global slowdown amplified by the U.S.-China trade war. Because the source of the latest shock isn't primarily economic, it could be more difficult for interest-rate policy to buoy consumer spending and confidence.\n\n\"Finance didn't start this thing. It's not the Asian debt crisis. It's not a currency crisis, a mortgage crisis. It's not from Fed policy being too tight,\" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at research firm TS Lombard.\n\nMr. Blitz said it was reasonable to expect a short but swift downturn that would reverse by the summer, once the impact of the virus fades. But he added it was difficult to tell if other fissures in the economy might now surface after an 11-year rally in the stock market accompanied by a corporate-lending boom, all underwritten by lower interest rates.\n\nRelated\n\nBenchmark Treasury Yield Hits New Low What the Rate Cut Means for You Fed Sees Huge Demand for Repos\n\n\"The risk is that whenever any recession takes hold, a different reality can emerge from what caused it once unaccounted-for excesses underlying the U.S. economy are laid bare,\" he said.\n\nA separate risk is that the Fed's response won't be effective without a robust response by public-health authorities that maintains confidence in the nation's ability to contain or mitigate the spread of illness.\n\nCoronavirus\n\nLive Updates\n\nWhat We Know\n\nHow to Prepare\n\nYour Questions Answered\n\nMore on the Fed's Decision\n\nHeard on the Street: Surprise Cuts Are No Miracle Cure Streetwise: Investors Shouldn't Take Much Solace From Central Bank Resolve Stocks Drop Despite Fed Move\n\nEven then, steps to limit outbreaks could lead to changes in social behavior that temporarily depresses spending and curtails hiring. That could lead weak businesses to fail and distressed households to fall behind on monthly payments.\n\n\"Right now the public health response is the most important. How effective are they treating people?\" said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist who is now economic-policy director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank. \"The Fed is not going to be the lead policy lever.\"\n\nPresident Trump in recent days called on the Fed to cut rates and said he was disappointed the central bank didn't do more on Tuesday, repeating his longstanding preference for U.S. borrowing costs to be lower than other advanced economies, including those with negative rates.\n\nMr. English said while he was confident the Fed wasn't being swayed by political pressure, there is a risk that the central bank's credibility suffers because not everyone will see it that way.\n\nOne silver lining of Mr. Trump's criticism, was that it \"was so unreasonable,\" said Mr. English. \"If he was making a reasonable argument, you would worry he was moving the needle.\"\n\nReal Time Economics in Your Inbox\n\nGet the latest economic news, analysis and data curated weekdays by WSJ's Jeffrey Sparshott. Sign up.\n\nAfter Tuesday's cut, investors expected the Fed would lower rates again in the coming weeks, including at the March meeting.\n\nFed officials repeatedly said last year it would be important to act aggressively at the first sign of a downturn in spending or hiring because they have less room to counteract a recession by cutting rates.\n\nFed officials are likely to look for evidence that businesses not directly affected by the virus are seeing a weakening of demand as they plot their next move. \"Are households and businesses hunkering down to see how this goes? If they see that, the Fed would provide more accommodation,\" said Mr. English.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs see the U.S. avoiding a recession for now but have downgraded the U.S. growth forecast to an annualized rate of 0.9% in the first quarter and 0% in the second quarter.\n\nMichael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, said Monday he saw a 50% chance the Fed would cut rates this year to zero, up from a 33% chance last week.\n\nThe Fed's action came after central banks in Australia and Malaysia cut rates and finance ministers and central-bank governors from the Group of Seven countries said they stand ready to cooperate. The Bank of Canada is expected to cut rates at its policy meeting Wednesday.\n\nThe Fed's rate cuts could be important for global growth, too, because with rates at negative levels in Europe and Japan, foreign central bankers have fewer tools to spur growth in their economies unless they grow more comfortable pushing rates deeper into negative territory.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It was an increase from 2017, when 7.9% of the population, or 25.6 million, were uninsured, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nAbout 2% of people infected with coronavirus have died and about 5% have developed serious infections that may require oxygen therapy or ventilators, based on research on cases in China.\n\nIn the U.S., there are more than 100 coronavirus cases. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at the congressional hearing Tuesday that \"we are seeing community transmission in a few places.\"\n\nThe administration is focusing on the costs of caring for uninsured people because individuals otherwise would have coverage through Medicaid, employers, or through private insurance purchased on the individual market, according to the person familiar with the conversations. No final decision has been made.\n\nHospitals, which typically bear the brunt of costs for uncompensated care, have been bracing for an influx of patients. Hospitals of all types provided more than $38 billion in uncompensated care in 2017, according to the American Hospital Association.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\"We encourage the department to look at using a national disaster program as an option because no one should think twice about seeking screening or treatment due to costs,\" said Tom Nickels, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association. \"We also urge them to cover both patients who have coronavirus and those who are under investigation for coronavirus.\"\n\nA 1918-like pandemic would cause U.S. hospitals to absorb a net loss of $3.9 billion, or an average $784,592 per hospital, according to a 2007 report in the Journal of Health Care Finance that called on policy makers to consider contingencies to ensure hospitals don't become insolvent as a result of a severe pandemic.\n\nThe National Disaster Medical System is subject to available funds and reimburses doctors and health facilities that provide care to eligible natural-disaster patients under specific guidelines if care isn't available in their local area. It has been used in the past for situations such as Hurricane Irma in 2017, when about 85 patients were covered under the program.\n\nServices that are covered include medically necessary hospital care, home health care, rehabilitation and primary care. More than 1,900 hospitals in the U.S. participate in the natural disaster care reimbursement program, according to HHS.\n\nRead More\n\nU.S. Coronavirus Death Toll Climbs to Six as Virus Spreads World-Wide What We Know About the Coronavirus, From Symptoms to Who Is at Risk Manufacturing Defect in Some Early CDC Test Kits Being Probed\n\nCoronavirus\n\nLive Updates\n\nWhat We Know\n\nHow to Prepare\n\nYour Questions Answered\n\nWrite to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

'If We Fail, What Happens to You All?' ", "body": "Short on supplies and sleep, medical staff are being stretched to the limit to stop a pandemic no one fully understands March 4, 2020 12:54 pm ET\n\nDriving one evening in Wuhan, China, last month, Zhang Xiaochun pulled her car to the side of the road. She was on the verge of a breakdown.\n\nShe'd been working nonstop for days at the center of China's coronavirus outbreak, where she is a doctor. Both of her parents had Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, as did many of her colleagues. The number of sick and dying was climbing. And on this day, Dr. Zhang had forgotten about her 9-year-old daughter, who was home alone and scared -- and who, at that moment, wasn't picking up the phone.\n\nDr. Zhang's eyes welled up, but she had no energy to cry. \"My tears wouldn't flow,\" she said in an interview on Feb. 18.\n\nAround the world, doctors are being stretched to the limit. Short on supplies and sleep, they're being asked to stop a global pandemic that no one fully understands. Adding to that strain, they're risking their own health while they diagnose cases and attend to sick patients -- along with the health of their spouses, children and other close family members.\n\nWith the virus now growing more quickly outside China than inside, it's a problem other countries will increasingly face.\n\nIn China, more than 3,000 doctors have been infected, according to official data, and at least 22 have died. Some medical professionals believe the numbers are even higher, adding uncertainty for doctors elsewhere confronting the virus. Untold numbers of family members have fallen ill.\n\nChinese doctors are working shifts of 10 hours or more. Many stay in the same hazmat suits the entire time, without food, water or bathroom breaks. Disrobing to eat or go to the bathroom could risk exposure. Medical workers are requesting psychological help to try to deal with the stress.\n\nInfectious-disease doctors around the world are trained to handle highly contagious illnesses, and know the risks. But the current outbreak is spreading so quickly that it's forcing hospitals to deploy staff with limited experience in infectious diseases and, sometimes, insufficient gear to keep them safe. Some hospitals can't find enough staff willing to take on the risk.\n\nIn South Korea, some nurses and support staff quit when the outbreak spread, their families begging them to resign. Iran has faced equipment shortages while its deputy health minister -- himself a surgeon -- has been infected with the virus.\n\nDoctors in China say conditions have improved significantly since the early days of the outbreak. Roughly 42,000 medical staff from around the country have descended upon Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province to provide relief. That includes around 4,000 military doctors in one of China's largest-ever mobilizations of military medical resources.\n\nWuhan has 53,000 beds in hospitals and temporary medical and quarantine facilities for treating patients with the coronavirus, with a goal of adding 17,000 more, according to an official media briefing on Feb. 20. Crowds and lines at fever wards have subsided as the rate of infections has slowed. Yet around 100 new cases are still emerging in Hubei province every day. An exhibit hall-turned-hospital that Zhongnan Hospital oversees had just one CT scanning machine during a recent tour by officials, according to state media.\n\nLiu Fan, a 59-year-old nurse at Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, one of the main coronavirus crisis centers in Wuhan, died from the virus even though she wasn't working in a fever ward, according to a Weibo post by the hospital. Her parents died from the virus a few days before her, and her brother, a local film director, died the same day she did, according to Chinese media.\n\nIn the early days of the outbreak, Wuchang Hospital's 51-year-old director, a neurosurgeon named Liu Zhiming, had warned colleagues about working too hard and burning out. He worried their immunities would decline.\n\nOn Jan. 24, a chest scan showed he had a serious infection himself; he later tested positive for the virus. As Dr. Liu lay in intensive care, he kept fielding calls and asking about patients, while colleagues grew more anxious.\n\n\"I'm worried I can't do anything,\" Dr. Liu texted them, according to an account in official Chinese media. In another message, he said that \"if it were any other illness, I would persevere and fight with everyone while sick.\"\n\nHis wife, Cai Liping, a head nurse at another hospital, implored Dr. Liu to let her visit, but he kept saying no, according to official Chinese media. She asked him to call her every day at 2 p.m. to reassure her he was OK. She reminded him to breathe oxygen and not be afraid.\n\nOn Feb. 18, Dr. Liu died. A colleague sobbed while telling the media: \"We really wanted to give him a farewell, but we had so much work to do.\"\n\nMany of the heaviest burdens are falling on younger doctors and nurses, who are seen as better suited for high-risk situations, because of their stronger immune systems.\n\nOne doctor, Peng Yinhua, died at just 29 years old, according to state media. He was working in a respiratory and critical care unit, and had postponed his wedding celebration to stay on the job. Li Wenliang, the Chinese ophthalmologist turned folk hero who died after warning about the dangers of the virus, was in his early 30s. Both doctors' wives were pregnant.\n\nDr. Zhang, who worried about her 9-year-old daughter and sick parents, was more prepared for the crisis than most. A radiologist at Zhongnan Hospital, a 3,300-bed facility overlooking a lake in central Wuhan, she had served on the front lines of SARS in 2003, as well as after China's deadly Sichuan earthquake in 2008.\n\nOn Dec. 31, Dr. Zhang was on her first day of vacation and planning to take a trip with her parents and daughter to their hometown in Inner Mongolia. That morning, her superiors called, ordering her to attend an emergency meeting.\n\nTwo patients at Zhongnan had lung infections reminiscent of SARS. Word was spreading among staff that a mysterious illness was sweeping through a seafood market on the west side of town.\n\nAt the meeting, hospital officials issued new guidelines for staff to disinfect their spaces, unlock windows to ensure circulation of fresh air, and begin wearing goggles and other protection in some areas.\n\nDr. Zhang's colleagues had asked her to consult on the two patients' X-rays, and she was worried about what she saw. She warned colleagues that if a virus had spread from animals to humans, then human-to-human transmission would be easy.\n\nShe also spoke to the hospital's Communist Party secretary to explain her fear of another epidemic. Some people thought she was being alarmist, she says.\n\nWith the hospital short on supplies, Dr. Zhang made homemade masks out of gauze for her parents and daughter, just like she'd learned to do during SARS. The family canceled their holiday.\n\nA few days later, a technician in the imaging department discovered he had been infected. Sick patients began pouring in. Soon dozens of staff were sick at Zhongnan, and other Wuhan hospitals, as well.\n\nMost days, Dr. Zhang reviewed chest X-rays, a relatively low-risk job. Some days, she'd don a hazmat suit and tend to patients herself.\n\nWorried she might bring the virus back home, and overloaded with work, she began sleeping on an office sofa. She barely had time to eat and shower.\n\nShe figured her parents, who lived in her home, could take care of her daughter. Her husband was living and working hundreds of miles away and unable to join them after authorities announced a strict quarantine of Wuhan in late January.\n\nThen Dr. Zhang's 69-year-old mother admitted to feeling sick. Dr. Zhang convinced her parents to get tested for the virus. For her mother's first visit to the hospital, Dr. Zhang had her meet nearby, so her mother could put on protective gear before going in.\n\nBoth parents came up negative using the nucleic acid test, a finicky diagnostic tool test that regularly produced false negatives. Their CT scans told a different story.\n\n\"When I saw it, I knew,\" Dr. Zhang said, recalling her mother's first chest scan. \"My heart sank.\" Her father, who had been reluctant to get tested, had a lung infection that turned out to be even worse, though he showed no obvious symptoms at the time.\n\nAll along, the family worried about the youngest member, Dr. Zhang's daughter. Dr. Zhang had been too scared to check her daughter, until the girl volunteered. \"Scan me! It'll be OK,\" she said.\n\nHer lungs were normal.\n\nStill, Dr. Zhang was facing a crisis. Her husband was away, her parents were sick and contagious, and she was needed at the hospital. There was no one to take care of her daughter, whose school was closed.\n\nDr. Zhang planted her in the family's living room with instructions to look after herself -- and to stay away from her grandparents, who quarantined themselves in other rooms.\n\nThe 9-year-old learned how to heat up canned congee, placing it at each grandparent's door.\n\nAs her parents' conditions worsened, Dr. Zhang struggled to get them admitted to a hospital. Beds were limited and authorities were unwilling to make arrangements for people whose nucleic acid tests had come back negative.\n\nWith help from a colleague, Dr. Zhang got hold of some medicine, including antiretroviral medication for HIV that researchers are testing as a treatment for the coronavirus. Her parents suffered side effects, including nausea.\n\nThen, 10 quarantine spots opened up for family of Zhongnan Hospital staff, in an empty building slated for demolition. Dr. Zhang raced to grab a number to reserve a spot, while a colleague ran to guard two beds inside.\n\nThe new location wasn't designed to provide any medical treatment, but getting a room for her parents was a relief for Dr. Zhang. Although authorities had publicly announced there were no more beds there, scores of people had gathered there anyway, desperate to get space.\n\n\"Some people were clutching their stomach, others holding their heads and others coughing uncontrollably,\" said Dr. Zhang. Her heart broke.\n\nAfter the chaos that day, she suddenly remembered her daughter back home. She tried calling and pulled over her car. She was overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and hopelessness.\n\nIt took a moment for her to calm herself down. She told herself: \"It would be a disaster for the family if I couldn't pull it together.\"\n\nArriving home, Dr. Zhang pushed open the door to find the lights out.\n\nIn a panic, she called out for her daughter. A faint voice replied from the dark as her daughter stirred from a nap. She had been hungry without food at home, and had little energy to do anything but lie down and sleep.\n\nHer daughter ate the meal her mother had brought, pleading for things to be different. She asked why her mother had to be at work all the time.\n\n\"I was afraid to be alone at home today,\" Dr. Zhang's daughter told her.\n\nDr. Zhang felt terrible but tried to coax her daughter to understand. \"You need to grow up,\" she said. \"If you don't grow up, Mom will be even more worried.\"\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nWhat's the best way to support health-care workers? Join the conversation below.\n\nEventually, her daughter said, \"Mom is so strong, I'll be too,\" though she admitted she was still scared. Dr. Zhang tucked her daughter in for the night, letting her watch cartoons from her bed.\n\nCoronavirus\n\nLive Updates\n\nWhat We Know\n\nHow to Prepare\n\nBreaking Down the Costs\n\nTravel Q&A\n\nDr. Zhang knew then she needed to find some way for her husband to join her in Wuhan. The couple applied for special permission from the government; two days later, he got approval to drive the roughly 14-hour journey into the city.\n\nOn Feb. 3, Dr. Zhang took to her social messaging account to call for the use of chest X-rays in diagnosing Covid-19, instead of lab tests that were resulting in so many false negatives. She raised the alarm on cross-infection within families, recommending the government make use of hotels and school dormitories to quarantine suspected cases.\n\nSpeaking up was no small risk for Dr. Zhang, who went back and forth over whether to post the night before. Even Dr. Zhang's friends were worried about her post, she said. Authorities had detained people for speaking up about the outbreak in its early days.\n\nThe next day, China's National Health Commission incorporated the use of chest scans in diagnoses in Hubei province. Days later, authorities reclassified more than 13,000 suspected instances of the virus as confirmed cases. That meant many more patients could have a better chance of access to treatment, including hospital beds and quarantine locations as they opened up.\n\nFriends sent screenshots of the good news to Dr. Zhang. She worried about a shortage of CT scanners and called up manufacturers that could produce portable machines. She helped coordinate with staff at other facilities to ensure they had enough equipment and technicians.\n\nFor Dr. Zhang, the outbreak has felt never-ending. Her hospital oversees three separate coronavirus facilities with 5,400 beds.\n\nAt its own campus, Zhongnan worked to add 2,000 new beds, up from a few hundred for coronavirus patients previously. With their offices being repurposed for patients, Dr. Zhang and her colleagues moved into a hotel, where they work and sleep.\n\nDr. Zhang believes it will take months for hospitals to work through all the infected patients. Letting down their guard could lead to a resurgence in cases.\n\nOne night, Dr. Zhang returned to her hotel carrying half a dozen lunch boxes for her colleagues. She says her back felt like it would split in two, and she had developed a persistent cough.\n\nA hotel security guard checked Dr. Zhang's temperature and asked her to log what time she entered the building. She had completely lost track of time.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" she said, as the guard raised a thermometer to her forehead. It was normal.\n\n\"If we fail, what happens to you all?\" she said, walking away.\n\nRelated reading\n\nWhat We Know About the Coronavirus, From Symptoms to Who Is at Risk Fear, Anxiety and Guilt: The Psychological Toll of China's Coronavirus War How to Prepare for the Coronavirus\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Eric.Morath@wsj.com Updated March 6, 2020 8:31 am ET\n\nEmployers added 273,000 jobs in February and the jobless rate was 3.5%, signs of labor-market strength before the coronavirus spread widely in the U.S.\n\nWages increased 3.0% from a year earlier in February, in line with recent months.\n\nEconomists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast February job growth of 175,000, an unemployment rate of 3.5% and year-over-year wage growth of 3.0%.\n\nMost companies reported their February employee headcounts before cases linked to the virus rose in the U.S. and other countries outside of China, triggering fears the epidemic would hit global and U.S. economic growth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a half-percentage-point Tuesday, one of several global central-bank efforts to support economic growth amid uncertainty about the virus's effects.\n\nSome companies have expressed concern in recent days about the business impact of the virus and the global economic slowdown. United Airlines Holdings Inc. announced a hiring freeze through the end of June as the spread of the virus depressed bookings. Hyatt Hotels Corp. also froze hiring at some properties as the growing coronavirus outbreak dampens demand for travel.\n\nWhile virus-related uncertainty could lead to a wider slowdown in hiring in future months, many employers are still reluctant to cut workers given the virus could soon pass and the labor market remains tight. Jobless claims, a proxy for company layoffs, declined to 216,000 last week, a historically low level.\n\nGigi Schweikert, president of child-care franchise Lightbridge Academy, said the virus is not impeding hiring plans. The 1,600-employee company is looking to add nearly 400 teachers and directors this year as franchises expand near growing populations of dual-income earners.\n\n\"It's still extremely difficult to hire,\" she said. \"With the unemployment rate as low as it is, there are fewer candidates who are available for the positions.\"\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nWhich industry is most susceptible to disruption from the coronavirus outbreak? Why?

This includes a posting for a microbiologist to assist with coronavirus testing in Austin, Texas and another for registered nurses to conduct coronavirus screenings in Fairfield, California.\n\nThe impact of the virus on economic data has been muted so far, but most private-sector and government economic surveys were conducted before concerns of the infection's potential economic effect rose in late February. February's payroll gain of 273,000 suggests the U.S. economy was on strong footing preceding these escalating anxieties.\n\nLast month, industries including health care, restaurants and construction added jobs at a robust clip. Federal government employment rose, mainly reflecting 7,000 new temporary Census hires.\n\nAverage hourly earnings increased 9 cents in February to $28.52. Wages were up 3.0% from a year earlier, remaining within the narrow range of the last year and a half, but still a solid pace considering inflation is low.\n\nKate Bischoff, a Minnesota employment lawyer, said some of her clients in technology and professional services are rethinking the wage increases they had budgeted for 2020, wondering if they can afford to dole out raises if coronavirus wreaks havoc on the economy.\n\n\"Should we be preparing for a recession?\" she said they're asking. \"Should we be raising salaries at this point in time?\"\n\nRelated\n\nTo See the Full Labor Department Report Keep Up to Date With the WSJ Real Time Economics Calendar\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com and Eric Morath at eric.morath@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Updated March 4, 2020 6:16 pm ET\n\nResearchers have started to recruit healthy Seattle-area volunteers to participate in the first clinical trial of an experimental coronavirus vaccine, a faster-than-expected start for the first vaccine readied for testing.\n\nKaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle said Wednesday it aims to enroll 45 adults from the region in the trial. The study will test the safety of various doses of the vaccine developed by biotech Moderna Inc. MRNA -1.50% and whether the shots produce an immune response.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe development and now testing of the vaccine has moved rapidly as compared with typical vaccine R&D, though federal health officials have cautioned that real-world use of the shots, if they succeed in testing, remains more than a year away.\n\nCoronavirus\n\nLive Updates\n\nWhat We Know\n\nHow to Prepare\n\nBreaking Down the Costs\n\nTravel Q&A\n\nEven if the first trial has positive results, additional testing would be needed to validate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, according to Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID. Dr. Fauci told a House subcommittee Wednesday he expected it would take at least a year to 18 months to be \"fully confident that we would have a vaccine that would be able to protect the American people.\"\n\nThere isn't an approved treatment or vaccine for the novel coronavirus.\n\nModerna, of Cambridge, Mass., shipped the first batch of the vaccine to be used in human testing last week, a rapid turnaround time after researchers learned the virus's genetic sequence in January.\n\nThe vaccine contains the genetic material RNA, designed to instruct the human body's cells to make a protein from the coronavirus that doesn't cause infection but triggers an immune response to the virus. The vaccine isn't made from the actual virus.\n\nThe vaccine study is being sponsored by the NIAID, which helped design the Moderna vaccine.\n\nThe Kaiser Permanente institute has a vaccine treatment and evaluation unit that is one of several such sites in the U.S. conducting infectious-disease research with funding from the NIAID.\n\nLisa Jackson, a senior investigator at the institute and lead researcher for the study, said dosing could start in the next few weeks. \"That we have a vaccine supply to conduct a trial within a two-month period is pretty much unprecedented,\" she said in an interview.\n\nFor the vaccine trial, the institute is planning to enroll healthy adults ages 18 to 55 who meet certain criteria. To be eligible, they can't have certain health conditions or be taking medications that affect the immune system.\n\nThe study participants will receive two injections of Moderna's vaccine 28 days apart, according to a summary of the trial posted on the government database clinicaltrials.gov. Researchers expect the subjects to come to 11 in-person visits and have four phone conversations with trial personnel over a 14-month period.\n\nStudy subjects will receive $100 for each visit, and people who complete all scheduled visits would get a total of $1,100, according to a website set up by the Kaiser institute to recruit volunteers.\n\nThe institute is contacting some Kaiser Permanente members to see whether they are interested in enrolling, though participants don't have to be Kaiser members, Dr. Jackson said.\n\nSeveral other companies and organizations including Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi SA are developing vaccines against the new coronavirus, with testing expected to begin in the coming months. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. INO 7.72% said Tuesday it was accelerating the timeline for its experimental coronavirus vaccine and plans to start a clinical trial in healthy volunteers in April.\n\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

", "body": "Fears about coronavirus may give homeowners an opportunity to lower their monthly bill By Julia Carpenter Julia Carpenter The Wall Street Journal BiographyJulia Carpenter @juliaccarpenter julia.carpenter@wsj.com Updated March 5, 2020 10:24 am ET\n\nWorries about coronavirus have battered stocks and sent investors fleeing to the safety of U.S. government debt.\n\nOn Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped below 1% for the first time and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate to a range between 1% and 1.25%.\n\nMortgage rates fell along with those yields. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.29% during the week of March 5, a record low, according to FreddieMac, and the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 2.79%.\n\nIf the yield on the 10-year Treasury declines even further, mortgage rates could drop more, too, though they don't always move in lockstep with the government benchmark.\n\n\"This opens up a whole new world of refinancing for mortgage borrowers,\" said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research group. \"It's a matter of time in terms of how fast lenders lower their rates to reflect a 10-year [U.S. Treasury note] and it's also a question of how fast they want to go to that level, but at a minimum, we're talking mortgage rates at 3.25% if not below 3% in the next few weeks, if everything stays the same -- and frankly, that would be a once-in-a-lifetime refinancing opportunity.\"\n\nWhether it makes sense to refinance a mortgage now comes down to a host of personal factors. It depends, for example, on the cost of a refi, how long you plan to stay in your home, how much you hope to save, what you think your house is worth -- and your view of the world economy.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nAre you thinking of refinancing? What are your considerations? Join the conversation below.\n\n\"Yields have fallen quite steeply and the reason is that there's concerns about a big slowdown in the global economy, largely because of the coronavirus,\" said Kathy Jones, senior vice president and chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\nFor those considering a refi now, first look at the difference, or spread, between the current rate and the rate in the market. Then looks at costs, as a refinancing means paying significant closing costs -- including title insurance, transfer taxes and an appraisal -- which can often amount to a few thousand dollars.\n\nIf the potential saving from a lower-rate mortgage doesn't make up for those costs, it may not make sense to refinance just yet. \"The old rule of thumb used to be two years,\" Mr. Cecala said. \"If you can pay it back within two years and you expect to be in the house five years, then why not do it?\"\n\nWhen It Is Worth Refinancing\n\nHome buyer puts 20% down on a home worth $266,300, the median home price in January. No plans to move soon. Pays a 4% rate, resulting in a monthly payment excluding taxes, fees and insurance of $1,017.09, according to LendingTree. Dropping to a 3.25% rate would decrease the payment from $1,017.09 to $927.16. The homeowner would save around $90 a month, with exclusions. Assuming refinancing costs of $2,000, this homeowner would need to stay in the home for a little less than two years to make it worth the money.\n\nRates have fallen before, so those who wait to refinance could potentially see even better ones. As the coronavirus continues to develop and its effects are felt around the globe, Mr. Cecala said the mortgage market could see even more changes.\n\nLauri Droster, branch director at RBC Wealth Management in Madison, Wis., suggests considering a refinance if there's a difference somewhere between one-half a percentage point or 1 percentage point.\n\nMs. Droster said it's easier for people to understand the potential saving when they make it personal. Calculate how refinancing could affect monthly mortgage payments rather than simply looking at the percentage difference and examining it in an abstract way.\n\n\"When they see it in real dollars, then they can make that comparison,\" she said. \"That's where they can really see what it means, when they can see it in dollars and say 'I'm paying $1,500 a month right now for my mortgage and 1% lower is down to $1,200 a month.'\"\n\nWhen It Isn't Worth Refinancing\n\nHome buyer puts 20% down on a home worth $266,300, getting a 4% rate on the $213,040 fixed-rate loan. Plans to move within the next two years. Dropping to a 3.65% rate saves $42 a month, with exclusions. With refinancing costs of $2,000, they'd need to stay closer to four years to make refinancing worth the cost.\n\nFor those with adjustable-rate mortgages, however, Mr. Cecala recommends borrowers check how often their rate adjusts. Most only do so once every six or 12 months, in which case some homeowners might want to refinance from an ARM to a fixed-rate, he said, to lock into low rates.\n\n\"If you're saying 'I'm planning on being in this home for the next five years, and I don't want to worry about what's happening with interest rates,' that's pretty much a no-brainer,\" he said.\n\nThose with high loan-to-value ratios, however, may not be able to refinance, despite the fact that they may want to do so. But Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac, said that with home values steadily rising over the past decade, this circumstance is rare.\n\nDan Egan, managing director of behavioral finance at Betterment, is himself considering refinancing his house. To him, the move makes sense because he and his wife have decided to also shorten the time period of their loan, from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage. Their net monthly payments could be higher as a result, but he'd be paying lower interest rates over a shorter time. His tax situation wouldn't change as \"the standard deduction is high enough.\"\n\n\"My rate was 4% and it was a 30-year mortgage I am six years into, so I'm looking now, especially with the current softening in the stock market. If rates get a little lower, I could be looking at a new mortgage rate of 3.5%,\" he said. \"The difference between 4% and 3.5% may sound small, unless you're looking at those interest payments over many years. So for myself, that change would mean saving somewhere around $500 a month, which is significant.\"\n\nWith the mortgage rates dropping and refinancing interest growing, Mr. Cecala said that the math \"gets easier.\"\n\n\"The more you can adjust the interest rate, the more palatable it is to pick up closing costs,\" he said. \"If you're saving $800 a month, you don't balk at spending $8,000 in closing costs because you'll make that back within a year.\"\n\nWrite to Julia Carpenter at Julia.Carpenter@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

@lucy_craymer Lucy.Craymer@wsj.com Updated March 2, 2020 10:27 pm ET\n\nCoronavirus\n\nLive Updates\n\nWhat We Know\n\nHow to Prepare\n\nWashington state emerged as the U.S. center of a spreading coronavirus fight Monday, as state health officials reported four additional deaths there and 18 confirmed cases and multiple schools closed for disinfection.\n\nThe deaths -- three women in their 70s or 80s linked to an outbreak at the Life Care Center nursing facility in Kirkland, Wash., and one man in his 40s from neighboring Snohomish County -- brought the U.S. death toll to six. The viral infection has now claimed more than 3,000 lives around the world.\n\nThe nursing home was the site of four of the nation's deaths and has four other confirmed cases, including one woman in her 80s who is in critical condition, according to King County's public health department.\n\nNew cases were also reported in California, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Hampshire and Illinois on Monday as state officials attempted to quell fears. At least 50 people have been diagnosed with the novel infection within the U.S., not including repatriated Americans.\n\nPresident Trump met Monday with executives from pharmaceutical companies who said various vaccines were being worked on. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci stressed that it would take at least a year to a year and a half to develop a vaccine. Therapeutic treatments could be available sooner.\n\nThe onset of local testing and expansion of testing criteria helped lead to the identification of new cases of Covid-19 in recent days in the U.S., stoking concerns over a wider spread of the virus and prompting governors and state health officials to take extra measures to prevent further transmission.\n\nThe Latest on the Coronavirus\n\nFour new deaths were reported in Washington state, and New York confirmed first case More than 89,000 cases were confirmed globally, with over 3,000 deaths Some 60 countries have reported Covid-19 infections Leader of church in South Korea apologizes for role in spread of virus Iran logged 12 more deaths, raising its overall death toll to 66, the biggest after China Tracking the Coronavirus\n\nIn Washington, state labs can now process about 200 specimens a day, but that capacity will go up sharply later this week when they get help from the University of Washington, said Kathy Lofy, state health officer.\n\nState health officials are investigating another 29 possible cases, said Jeff Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County.\n\n\"We will be looking at the extent of community transmission,\" Dr. Duchin said in a briefing with state and local officials.\n\n\"The idea is to lessen the impact,\" he added. \"We know we cannot prevent the outbreak.\"\n\nKing County officials said they are closing on the purchase of a motel to house people needing isolation and places to recover. They are also deploying 14 modular homes that had been brought in from the oil fields of Texas for the homeless to house Covid-19 cases.\n\nA dozen schools in the Seattle area were closed Monday so cleaning crews could disinfect them, officials said. All 33 campuses in the Northshore School District, which includes parts of both King and Snohomish counties, will be closed Tuesday for similar cleaning, Superintendent Michelle Reid said in a letter to families.\n\nMore testing and preventive measures are under way in other states that have reported cases. State officials in Florida recommended nursing homes revise their visitation policies to prevent the spread among more vulnerable populations after two cases of the viral infection were identified in the state Sunday.\n\nIn Oregon, officials closed a middle-school gym for cleaning after identifying a third person with the new coronavirus, who had attended a youth basketball game there over the weekend. The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation said they were told the patient was an employee at their Wildhorse Resort and Casino. The board of trustees said it had canceled community events for a week and closed the casino, a school and a day care and a senior center to disinfect the buildings.\n\nDean Sidelinger, the state's health officer, said Monday he expects the number of cases to rise. But he urged residents to remain calm.\n\n\"We know people are scared,\" he said. \"We want to remind people that the vast majority of people infected with Covid-19 will have a mild disease.\"\n\nThe Illinois patient was identified by authorities as a woman in her 70s who is married to a man who tested positive for the illness over the weekend. The man was in isolation at a Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights, a Chicago suburb. His wife was in isolation at home.\n\nOn Monday, 120 evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship reached the end of their 14-day quarantine at San Antonio's Lackland Air Force Base. Local and state officials slammed the CDC for releasing a woman from quarantine in San Antonio who might have the virus.\n\nA CDC statement said the woman had been receiving treatment for possible symptoms of the novel coronavirus, but was released after two lab tests came back negative. A day later, a third test came back \"weakly positive\" and the woman was brought back into isolation, but had visited a hotel and shopping mall in the interim, local health officials said.\n\nThe city of San Antonio filed a request late Monday for a preliminary injunction to block the federal government from releasing any quarantined people without communicating its protocols to the city and sharing at least three Covid-19 tests for each patient.\n\nA federal judge expressed sympathy for the city's position but denied the injunction, writing that he doesn't have the authority to second-guess the medical recommendations of federal health authorities.\n\nHowever, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg issued a public-health emergency declaration to prevent those quarantined from leaving the base and going into the city, a power the federal judge noted was similar to a quarantine.\n\nThe CDC didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases has grown more quickly outside China than in China during the past week, raising the total in other countries past 9,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. In the past day, South Korea, Italy and Iran each reported more new cases than China, which added 202 to bring its tally of confirmed coronavirus infections to 80,026. Indonesia, Scotland and the Dominican Republic all reported their first cases Monday.\n\nThe death toll in South Korea, the worst-hit country other than China, rose to 26, as the number of confirmed cases hit 4,335. Iran's health ministry reported a more than 50% increase in coronavirus cases to 1,501 Monday. Its death toll from the disease rose to 66. Among the dead was a member of a council that advises Iran's supreme leader, according to the semiofficial Tasnim news agency.\n\nChina's National Health Commission on Monday said 2,837 more patients had recovered and been discharged from hospitals -- far exceeding the number of new cases -- but an additional 42 people had died. In all, 44,462 individuals in China -- or 55% of those sickened by the coronavirus -- have recovered while 2,915 have died.\n\nDale Fisher, a professor at National University of Singapore who specializes in infectious diseases, said the outbreak will continue globally unless more countries take a stricter approach to finding all the individuals who had contact with infected people. In places with a large number of cases, they may have to take extreme measures and quarantine large areas, he added.\n\n\"If you do nothing you'll get another Wuhan,\" said Dr. Fisher, who also heads the World Health Organization's global outbreak alert and response network.\n\nRead More\n\nIran Mobilizes 300,000 People and Deploys Drones and Water Cannon to Halt the Spread of Coronavirus Leader of Secretive Church at Center of South Korea's Virus Epidemic Apologizes Fear, Anxiety and Guilt: The Psychological Toll of China's Coronavirus War Coronavirus Cases Mount as Second Person Dies in U.S. School Trip to Italy Is Behind Rhode Island Cases How to Prepare for the Coronavirus What We Know About the Coronavirus\n\nA large number of countries are still barring entry to noncitizens who have been to mainland China in the past 14 days, and many among them recently extended those restrictions to individuals who have been in Iran, Italy and South Korea.\n\nThe U.S. advised Americans not to travel to affected parts of Italy and South Korea and announced additional screening for travelers from countries or areas it has designated as high-risk. The screenings will take place both before passengers board U.S.-bound flights and after they arrive.\n\nDuring a briefing at the White House on Monday, Trump administration officials said they were closely monitoring new cases in the European Union and that travel advisories could expand depending on the case loads in foreign countries. Officials urged people to remain calm and said the risk of the virus remains low in the U.S.\n\n\"This is a time to use common sense, a time to wash your hands,\" Vice President Mike Pence said. \"But this time of year, that's always a good decision.\"\n\nWrite to Jennifer Calfas at Jennifer.Calfas@wsj.com, Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com and Lucy Craymer at Lucy.Craymer@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

They were popular goals that seemed in reach given that city revenues had been rising almost every year since the recession.\n\nOn taking office, Mr. Clark quickly figured out the city's progress had stalled. Property tax collections were down, and businesses were cutting jobs. A fall in city revenue, coupled with growing debt payments, meant there would be no relief from business taxes or water bills.\n\n\"We just have to figure out ways to do more with less,\" Mr. Clark said, echoing a familiar mantra surfacing in dozens of U.S. cities.\n\nA decade of growth in the U.S. economy allowed cities to patch fiscal holes left by the financial crisis and recession. A surprising number now see new signs of trouble.\n\nThe proportion of American cities expecting general-fund revenue to drop more than 3% when the books close on the 2019 fiscal year increased to 27% from 17% in fiscal 2018, when adjusted for inflation. That is one of the findings from a Wall Street Journal analysis of data collected from 478 U.S. municipalities by the National League of Cities, an advocacy group.\n\nThe total general-fund revenue reported by these cities -- locales that span the U.S. -- is expected to be lower in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018, adjusted for inflation, the first such dip in seven years. Cities in the survey range in population from the low tens of thousands to the millions.\n\nGeneral-fund revenue typically represents dollars not earmarked for a specific purpose, a flexible pot of money to spend on public goods and services.\n\n\"It's a big deal when you have this many cities concerned about the near-term future,\" said Matt Fabian, a partner with municipal bond research firm Municipal Market Analytics. \"Maybe they don't hire new police as quickly as they did before...Maybe they put off plans to address the big challenges that cities are facing like pensions and climate change.\"\n\nAmerican cities are generally doing better than rural communities, buoyed by the U.S. expansion. Yet the boom in such metropolitan areas as Denver, Salt Lake City and Nashville, Tenn., masked fiscal weakness in cities tied to manufacturing and other shrinking industries.\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nHow is your city doing financially? Join the conversation below.\n\nFallout from the coronavirus disease on the U.S. economy and city budgets is another potential setback. In the past week, New York City has held daily meetings of pension advisers, and California put out a warning to prospective municipal bond investors.\n\nAll regions of the U.S. contains cities that are losing fiscal ground, the Journal found. In the West, 29% of cities expected declines of more than 3% in general-fund revenue in fiscal 2019, up from 18% in fiscal 2018. In the South, the proportion of cities reporting a revenue drop went to 20% from 16%, using the same measure; in the Northeast, it went to 31% from 14%.\n\nOn the flip side, nearly 60% of U.S. cities reported general-fund revenue increases that outpaced inflation in fiscal 2018. Yet even in this group, expectations are fading: Cities expecting similar growth in fiscal 2019 fell to 53%.\n\nStagnating or declining revenues are easier to manage for growing cities in the West and South. In New England and the Midwest, many places are struggling with losses of population as well as industry.\n\nJob losses hit hardest in cities that have been barely keeping pace with expenses during the recovery. Tighter household budgets translate into smaller sales-tax allocations. City populations shrink when residents follow jobs out of town, hurting home prices, commerce and property tax collections.\n\nThe general-revenue declines struck earliest in the Midwest, where combined inflation-adjusted city revenues fell by 4.3% in the 2018 fiscal year from 2017, the Journal found.\n\nOver the 12 months ending in November, 28 metropolitan areas in the Midwest lost manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, including Detroit, Youngstown, Ohio, and Louisville, Ky.\n\nSome losses stem from the shifting global economy and disruptions from the U.S.-China trade war. In Blue Springs, Mo., population 55,000, an auto-parts manufacturer last fall announced it was closing its plant to save costs, a loss of more than 150 local jobs. Operations are moving to Monterrey, Mexico, a company executive said. The city expects general-fund revenue to fall slightly for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.\n\nOther disasters have come out of the blue. In Wichita, Kan., aerospace company Spirit AeroSystems Inc. said in January it was laying off 2,800 workers after Boeing Co. 's decision to suspend production of its 737 MAX aircraft.\n\nPension IOU\n\nMany cities operating with little fiscal breathing room have been sweating to cover day-to-day city operations under the burden of growing retirement costs and past borrowing.\n\nBond and pension liabilities owed by roughly 1,000 U.S. cities ballooned nearly 25% to about $500 billion in 2018 compared with 2013, according to an analysis of data from Merritt Research Services. Roughly 50 million Americans live in cities that are devoting at least a fifth of annual spending to debt.\n\nAs many as 20 of the largest U.S. cities could face either service cuts or tax increases to cover the costs of pensions, retiree health care and interest on bond debt, according to a J.P. Morgan Asset Management study. New Haven, Conn., and Jersey City, N.J., for instance, raised taxes last year to cover such expenses.\n\nFew municipalities are in a deeper hole for their size than Harvey, a city of 24,641 that was founded in 1891 by a lumber tycoon.\n\nHarvey, located about 17 miles south of downtown Chicago, grew into an industrial center, producing car mufflers, farm and mining equipment and military airplane parts. When Mr. Clark, the new mayor, was born a half-century ago, the population was nearly 35,000. Roughly 46% of employed men over 16 worked in manufacturing, according to the 1970 census.\n\n\"Everybody had a nice fenced-off yard,\" Mr. Clark recalled of his boyhood neighborhood. \"There was either a Cadillac or a Lincoln in front.\" The local Dixie Square Mall had more than 50 stores, including Woolworth and Montgomery Ward.\n\nMr. Clark drove a forklift before getting a scholarship to law school. He opened his law practice 10 years ago in a former jewelry store downtown.\n\nFactories closed in the 1980s, taking jobs with them. By 1990, nearly 15% of men ages 25 to 54 were unemployed, according to the census. Dixie Square Mall was demolished in 2012 after closing years earlier.\n\nLongtime residents dispersed to other states. For years, they held annual gatherings, called \"Harvey Days,\" in Florida, California and Arizona. The reunions drew thousands of people who had lived, worked or attended high school in Harvey, said Carl Durnavich, who helped organize many of them.\n\nAfter the financial crisis, city services hit bottom. Broken streetlights went unrepaired, and the fire department was down to one working fire engine. Firefighters who couldn't fit aboard, crammed into a pickup truck, said Ron DeYoung, president of International Association of Fire Fighters Local 471.\n\nThe economic recovery finally hit town. One of the city's remaining manufacturers, Sterling Site Access Solutions, which straddles Harvey and the adjacent town of Phoenix, Ill., added roughly 100 jobs between 2013 and 2018. About half were skilled manufacturing positions. The local plant of an international lubricant-maker also expanded its workforce.\n\nIn 2018, the city's total private-sector jobs ticked up for the first time in six years, according to a state report. Then, the following year, job numbers fell, eroding most of the gains.\n\nVoters selected Mr. Clark, an outspoken alderman, as mayor. Local employers hailed him as an ally. In the weeks after Mr. Clark's inauguration, residents reported that some alleys had been cleared for the first time in years.\n\nBalancing act\n\nHarvey seemed poised for a turnaround. Signs of distress emerged instead. Property taxes, the city's largest revenue source, fell in the 2018 fiscal year, which ended April 30, 2018. The decline wasn't reported until an audit was completed in October.\n\nRaising rates to make up the losses risked driving away residents and business. Sterling opened a new plant last year, but it was in Texas. Carter Sterling, the company's chief executive, said he decided to expand out of state, in part, because property taxes in Harvey and neighboring Phoenix were too high. Property owners in Harvey pay some of the highest rates in the Chicago metropolitan area, according to an analysis from the Civic Federation, a business-backed watchdog group.\n\nDavid Abshire, vice president at LB Steel, a local manufacturer, said the city's property tax rates discourage new business, especially with city services falling short. Mr. Clark isn't considering lowering property taxes, he said, because the city needs the money.\n\nMr. Abshire praised the mayor's work so far, but he said he was still waiting for the city to raze the collapsing building across the street from LB Steel. It makes a poor impression on manufacturing executives he invites to see his nearly 500,000 square-foot facility.\n\n\"We have world-class customers coming here,\" Mr. Abshire said. \"They go, 'Whoa, I don't even know if I should drive in here.' \"\n\nCity officials said they were working on securing funds to tear down many vacant structures in town.\n\nDecisions by Mr. Clark's predecessor, Eric Kellogg, drove up the city's total bond debt to $35 million. Its liability to police and firefighter pension funds grew to $82 million. Use of some of the bond proceeds drew scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged the former mayor with fraud after finding the city spent investor money for a hotel project on payroll instead. In a civil settlement with the SEC, Mr. Kellogg agreed to stay out of future bond deals. He didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe state in 2018 began garnishing millions of dollars in city revenues to refill pension coffers. Like many cities, Harvey had long made smaller-than-needed payments to swelling pension obligations. During Mr. Kellogg's tenure, the city paid nothing into police and fire pension funds for several years, according to city financial reports.\n\nThe city has less than 33 cents on hand for every dollar of benefits it has promised retired and working police officers and about 17 cents for every dollar owed retired and working firefighters, according to city records. As a measure of its contraction, Harvey sends paychecks to more retired firefighters than working ones.\n\nBefore taking office, Mr. Clark hoped officials representing police and fire pension funds would agree to accept smaller payments over a longer period, giving the city more leeway for urgent expenses. Fund officials haven't agreed.\n\nBringing an economic recovery to Harvey will be a huge challenge, said City Councilwoman Shirley Drewenski, a college administrator. Her 3-bedroom house, built by her parents, was valued at $46,580 by the county assessor's office, less than what she paid for her new car.\n\nMr. Clark is focused on making the most of the revenue he has. The city public works department bought two new snowplows and new mowers. Some streetlights are set to be repaired with a grant for energy-saving LED lighting.\n\n\"You know that some things aren't going to happen,\" he said of the city's prospects \"You know that you're going to live a life of hand-me-downs.\"\n\n-- Cezary Podkul contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Thanks to the coronavirus, much of Chinese industry remains shut down. The potential ramifications of that for pharmaceuticals are now becoming clear.\n\nIndia, which supplies around 40% of U.S. generic drugs, announced this week that it was restricting exports of 26 drug ingredients and medicines that use them, including several common antibiotics and the active ingredient in Tylenol. The news follows an announcement from the Food and Drug Administration warning that the coronavirus epidemic had already resulted in a shortage of a drug that it didn't name. The FDA said that other alternatives for the unnamed drug are available.\n\nAll of this highlights a worrying new development for U.S. consumers and businesses bracing for a potential coronavirus pandemic. The health of the U.S. workforce now depends partly on how quickly stalled Chinese pharmaceutical factories can get up and running again. The complexity of global drug supply chains, with even major manufacturers acknowledging that they can't always trace the ultimate origin of all the raw materials they use, makes it difficult to say exactly how large the vulnerability really is. But the balance of evidence suggests that if Chinese factory shutdowns persist into late spring, drug manufacturers could begin encountering serious problems for a range of products.\n\nFor some specific drugs, the problem is already here. Prices of ingredients needed to make some common drugs such as statins, used to control cholesterol levels, have risen 40% or more for some drugmakers, according to Bernstein Research. The Financial Times reported last month that Indian drugmakers were struggling to source a basic raw material needed for paracetamol. That active ingredient in Tylenol, known to Americans as acetaminophen, was among the drugs restricted for export this week.\n\nAntibiotics are a particularly worrying area of vulnerability. China is by far the largest exporter of basic antibiotic chemicals, with shipments worth $3.4 billion in 2018, according to United Nations data. India was the largest importer, buying $1.4 billion. Nearly 80% of that came from China. India then ships much of this abroad as packaged antibiotic drugs for retail: $1.5 billion worth in 2018, putting it roughly on par with other major exporters including Italy, Switzerland and Belgium.\n\nThe good news is that large global pharmaceutical makers tend to hold substantial inventory. So if disruptions in China ease over the next two months, serious shortages may well be averted. Industry experts interviewed by Bernstein Research in late February said inventories were mostly sufficient for several months. Many of the experts said substantial shortages were unlikely before the late second or early third quarter.\n\nEven the threat of a shortage during a global health scare casts globalization in a poor light, and perhaps with good reason in this case.\n\nWrite to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com and Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Then Coronavirus Hit.", "body": "By Tripp Mickle and Tripp Mickle The Wall Street Journal BiographyTripp Mickle @trippmickle tripp.mickle@wsj.com Yoko Kubota Yoko Kubota The Wall Street Journal BiographyYoko Kubota @Kubota_Yoko yoko.kubota@wsj.com Updated March 3, 2020 3:28 am ET\n\nLong before the coronavirus struck, Apple Inc.'s AAPL -0.54% operations team began raising concerns about the technology giant's dependency on China.\n\nSome operations executives suggested as early as 2015 that the company relocate assembly of at least one product to Vietnam. That would allow Apple to begin the multiyear process of training workers and creating a new cluster of component providers outside the world's most populous nation, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nSenior managers rebuffed the idea. For Apple, weaning itself off China, its second-largest consumer market and the place where most of its products are assembled, has been too challenging to undertake.\n\nApple's reliance on China has long frustrated staff -- and more recently unnerved investors. The coronavirus represents Apple's third major setback there in as many years, including the fallout from tensions with the U.S. that included tariffs and slower-than-expected iPhone sales in the country.\n\nFactory production has been crippled as China has shut down activities and sought to contain the outbreak, and Apple warned investors it won't meet its own sales estimates in the current quarter. Since that warning, Apple's market value has declined by more than $100 billion.\n\n\"No executive will admit in a public forum: We should have thought about\" the vulnerability to China, said Burak Kazaz, a Syracuse University supply chain professor and former researcher at International Business Machines Corp. \"But from this point on, there are no excuses.\"\n\nChina has been a critical factor in Apple's soaring market value. The country provides a stable, efficient, low-cost manufacturing base with an abundant network of suppliers that have helped cement Apple's profitability.\n\nApple Chief Executive Tim Cook continues to play down the need to significantly change Apple's supply chain. During an interview Thursday with Fox Business Network, he said unpredictable events are a facet of modern business and noted that Apple's operations team has previously navigated earthquakes, tsunamis and other challenges.\n\n\"The question for us is: Was the resilience there or not? And do we need to make some changes?\" Mr. Cook said. \"My perspective sitting here today is that if there are changes, you're talking about adjusting some knobs, not some sort of wholesale fundamental change.\"\n\nApple has recently started to experiment with small production moves out of China. These attempts, including plans to assemble wireless earbuds in Vietnam and produce iPhones in India and Mac Pro computers in the U. S., have laid bare a number of difficulties.\n\nA clean break with China is impossible. Apple relies on a workforce of more than three million indirect workers in China. Its top manufacturer, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group, hires hundreds of thousands of seasonal employees in China, many of whom manually insert tiny screws and thin printed circuit boards during the iPhone assembly process, people familiar with the process said. Tens of thousands of experienced manufacturing engineers oversee the process.\n\nFinding a comparable amount of unskilled and skilled labor is impossible, said Dan Panzica, a former Foxconn executive. The population in China has allowed suppliers to build factories with a capacity for more than 250,000 people. The number of migrant workers in China, who do much of Apple's production, exceed Vietnam's total population of 100 million. India is the closest comparison, but its roads, ports and infrastructure lag far behind those in China.\n\n\"You're not going to be able to have mega-factories anywhere else,\" Mr. Panzica said. \"You're going to have to break them up.\"\n\nMoving out could also jeopardize Apple sales in China, which counts for nearly a fifth of its total revenue. Employing so many local workers helped the company gain access to the market and any reduction might weaken its standing with the government, which wields tremendous influence over how global brands are perceived, according to Neil Mawston, a technology researcher with the firm Strategy Analytics.\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nShould Apple be doing more to diversify its manufacturing base away from China? Join the conversation below.\n\nThough Apple's brand remains strong in China, its share of the smartphone market has declined to 7.5% from a peak of 12.5% in 2015 because of pressure from homegrown rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co., according to Canalys, a market research firm.\n\nMr. Cook, who joined the company in 1998, is the architect of Apple's China business. As head of operations, he assumed responsibility for a company saddled with extra inventory and reliant on its own U.S. manufacturing plants. Following the practices of Dell, Compaq and other computer brands, he started outsourcing to contract manufacturers in Asia.\n\nAround 2000, he met Foxconn founder Terry Gou, who would become the dominant contract manufacturer in Asia. Foxconn struck deals to be one of the few manufacturers of iPods, which made its debut in 2001, and an early maker of the iPhone, which launched in 2007. Beijing was supporting tech manufacturing because it wanted its factories to make more-sophisticated products rather than plastic toys and clothes. In 2001, Apple officially entered China with a Shanghai-based trading company.\n\nAs iPhone sales surged, Apple, Foxconn and China scrambled to meet the demand. In 2010, China took over farmland in Zhengzhou, and within months, a Foxconn factory complex was built for 250,000 workers. The government also has helped funnel workers to Foxconn, posting notices online.\n\nConditions in China challenged Apple. Suicides at Foxconn factories and reports of employees exceeding a 60-hour workweek led to criticism of the company, which publishes an annual supplier responsibility report evaluating workplace conditions. Apple says it holds suppliers to the strictest standards in the industry.\n\nOver time, Apple, Foxconn and China formed a triangle of interdependency. Apple grew to depend on Foxconn to make devices and Chinese consumers to buy them. Foxconn built its business by leaning on China's vast workforce and control over land to construct factories. And China became beholden to Foxconn as the nation's largest private-sector employer and Apple as a trainer of new technology suppliers.\n\nThe entanglement unnerved some Apple executives, who encouraged company leaders to look outside China to minimize the risks of labor unrest or a change in Beijing's position on Apple.\n\nPresident Trump's policies rocked the relationship. After winning the election, Mr. Trump said in Time magazine that he told Mr. Cook that he wanted Apple \"to build a great plant, your biggest and your best, even if it's only a foot bigger than some place in China.\" The administration later started levying tariffs on imports of goods made in China.\n\nMr. Cook managed to avert tariffs on Apple's bestselling product, the iPhone, telling President Trump it would put the company at a competitive disadvantage to its biggest rival, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. But Apple wasn't able to avoid tariffs on headphones and other devices.\n\nSamsung isn't subject to the tariffs because it moved most of its smartphone manufacturing out of China in recent years. It is now assembling its signature phones in Vietnam, India and South Korea.\n\nThe shift out of the country came after Samsung's share of China's smartphone market had already collapsed. It went from selling one in every five phones in 2014 to claiming less than a 1% share of the smartphone market, as homegrown rivals outmaneuvered it, and a plan to install a U.S. missile-defense system in South Korea upset Beijing, triggering a Chinese consumer backlash.\n\nAssembling a Samsung Galaxy in Vietnam is simpler because the company uses larger and more pre-assembled components, such as its display, according to former operations executives. The company also glues the phones together, a process that is easier to automate than inserting the tiny screws on an iPhone, said Kyle Wiens, founder of iFixit, a firm that analyzes smartphones.\n\nApple's design team has long adhered to the philosophy of its former chief designer, Jony Ive, who believed that a well-made product required just as much precision and care on its interior design as its exterior look-and-feel.\n\n\"It's extremely intricate and complicated,\" said Mr. Panzica, formerly of Foxconn.\n\nTariffs imposed on headphones were a catalyst for Apple to shift manufacturing of the AirPods Pro wireless earbuds from China to Vietnam, said Jeff Luo, a supply-chain analyst with Isaiah Research. He said Chinese contract manufacturers Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and GoerTek Inc. were told late last year to set up production by March at plants that should be able to make about 4 million units monthly of AirPods Pro.\n\nLuxshare said it couldn't comment on specific clients or products. GoerTek didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nAirPods are easier to shift out of China because they have about a third as many components as an iPhone, which has about 1,000. They are also glued together rather than screwed, Mr. Luo said.\n\nA Communist country, Vietnam offers some of the same benefits as China. Labor is cheap, and officials have encouraged the development of industrial parks with lower tax rates.\n\nIt also has its drawbacks. Few people speak English and manufacturing lines are typically run by people from China, which creates a communications gap. The manufacturing procedures are slightly more inefficient and the factories are still learning processes such as work orders, operations executives who have visited said.\n\nIn India, Apple set up iPhone manufacturing partly to avoid the country's 20% tax on imports. It also wanted to comply with a law requiring single-brand foreign retailers to buy at least 30% of their manufacturing materials from India.\n\nIn 2017, after several years of planning, it completed its first trial run for an iPhone SE using the contract manufacturer Wistron Corp. It has since begun making iPhones at a Foxconn factory near Chennai.\n\nApple has been cautious as Indian workers gain experience. Last year, it was hurtling ahead with a plan to make the iPhone 11 in India, a manufacturing first for a company that had long relied on China to assemble its newest models.\n\nBut the technology giant halted the effort before setting up a single manufacturing line for that device, a person familiar with the matter said. India wasn't ready to supply skilled labor or the robust infrastructure Apple expects. It opted to make the iPhone 11 in China instead.\n\nApple is unlikely to shift any of the production of its most expensive iPhones to India later this year, a person familiar with Foxconn's overseas operations said. The supply chain isn't in place, and workers in India aren't ready to produce the high-end, organic light-emitting diode models, this person said. Foxconn didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEfforts to restart production in the U.S. have also hit snags. A plant that has made the niche Mac Pro desktop in Austin, Texas, since 2013 ships product only to North and South America. The models sold around the rest of the world are made in China.\n\nAnd when it came time to choose where to make a new model of iPhone analysts expect Apple to launch in the coming weeks, China got the nod.\n\n-- Newley Purnell and Yang Jie contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com and Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The patient likely was exposed to the virus while aboard a Princess Cruises ship that sailed between San Francisco and Ensenada, Mexico, last month, the officials said.\n\nFifteen first responders and medical personnel who treated the person at Kaiser Permanente hospital in Roseville, Calif., have been put in quarantine, but so far aren't exhibiting symptoms, local health officials said.\n\nHealth officials said other passengers on the ship, the Grand Princess, may have been exposed and they are working to contact them.\n\nPrincess Cruises' owner, Carnival Corp., said it is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and following its recommendations. It also is canceling the ship's current voyage to Ensenada and Hawaii, returning the Grand Princess early to San Francisco, where passengers will be screened. All passengers on the previous voyage have been informed of the situation, Carnival said.\n\nPrincess Cruises officials said in a letter to passengers Wednesday that the CDC had notified them it was investigating \"a small cluster\" of cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, in Northern California tied to the ship's voyage last month.\n\nPrincess also owns the Diamond Princess, which saw an outbreak of the coronavirus in Asia in which more than 500 passengers were diagnosed with Covid-19 in one of the largest global outbreaks.\n\n\"This case demonstrates the need for continued local, state and federal partnership to identify and slow the spread of this virus,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said.\n\nOfficials in Washington state said a 10th person died there Wednesday. All but one of the U.S. deaths linked to the coronavirus have occurred in the state, which has emerged as a hot spot in the virus fight. Washington now has at least 39 confirmed infections, according to its health department.\n\nThirty-one of the patients who tested positive reside in King County, which includes Seattle. Officials there on Wednesday recommended more vulnerable residents -- including those 60 and older, with underlying health conditions, weak immune systems or who are pregnant -- stay home. Health officials also recommended that businesses have employees work from home when possible and that organizations postpone or cancel large gatherings.\n\nThe county didn't recommend school closures due to a number of factors, including uncertainty of the role of children in the virus's spread, said Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for the county's public health department.\n\nThe Latest on the Coronavirus\n\nThe U.S. has 153 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University More than 13,000 confirmed cases are outside of China, triple the number a week earlier China reported 119 new cases on Wednesday, the lowest number since Jan. 21\n\n\"We know that this disease is not able to be put back in the box,\" he said. \"It's with us.\"\n\nTexas, meanwhile, reported its first confirmed case of Covid-19 late Wednesday. Officials of the Department of State Health Services said the infected man in Fort Bend County outside Houston recently returned from travel overseas and is currently isolated in a hospital.\n\nOverall, the U.S. has at least 153 cases of the virus, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Globally, the virus has infected 95,120 people and 3,254 have died. Some 54% of those infected have recovered.\n\nNew York state reported nine additional cases Wednesday, all linked to an earlier case in Westchester County north of New York City, said Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The new cases include the man's wife, children and the neighbor who drove him to a hospital.\n\nNew Jersey late Wednesday reported a presumptive case, the state's first.\n\nIn an effort to combat the spreading infection, lawmakers in Washington, D.C., reached a deal on funding a roughly $8 billion response, including more than $3 billion for developing treatments.\n\nCases in the U.S. were expected to rise this week as testing became more widely available. The CDC on Wednesday also again expanded its guidelines on whom can be tested.\n\nThe agency now allows physicians to make the judgment on testing; previously, doctors were required to follow the CDC's relatively strict criteria. The agency still encourages doctors to rule out other respiratory illnesses and consider travel history when making the decision.\n\nIn Washington state, public health officials said the new guidelines will allow anyone with symptoms of the illness to be tested. Due to high demand, the state's health department purchased new equipment, quadrupled laboratory staff and called upon commercial facilities to provide testing.\n\nTo help accommodate a growing number of coronavirus cases, King County officials placed modular quarantine units in one area in the county this week, they said. They also secured two other spots for the units in different parts of the county and purchased a hotel in the city of Kent, which they hope to have operational within several days.\n\nIn California, Los Angeles County announced six new cases as city officials enacted emergency declarations and warned residents to prepare for social and business disruptions.\n\nBarbara Ferrar, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said up to 3,000 people have been monitored to date and fewer than a dozen have developed symptoms. In the six new cases reported Wednesday, health officials said they know how the people came in contact with the virus and it didn't involve community transmission.\n\nElsewhere in California, Orange County announced two new cases and Contra Costa County announced its first. The two people in Orange County had a history of travel to affected countries, while the Contra Costa County patient didn't.\n\nAnd a medical professional contracted by the Department of Homeland Security to screen travelers at Los Angeles International Airport who had recently been to China tested positive for the virus, a DHS spokeswoman said Wednesday.\n\nNow equipped with testing capabilities, officials in Orange County said they expect to find more cases. But as the virus spreads, tension is ratcheting up over access to testing. On social media and elsewhere, people say they suspect they or a loved one has the illness but were unable to get tested.\n\nOfficials at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento said they weren't immediately able to get testing done by the CDC for a patient with a suspected viral infection who was transferred to the facility from another hospital.\n\n\"Since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for Covid-19, a test was not immediately administered,\" the hospital said in a statement issued last week.\n\nThe CDC later ordered testing, after the hospital expressed concern about the patient's condition, and the hospital was informed a few days later that the patient had tested positive for the illness.\n\n-- Alicia A.

It comes after a longstanding partnership between some of the world's largest oil producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, splintered on Friday. The sides failed to reach an agreement on production cuts to support the price of oil in the face of the coronavirus-related economic slowdown.\n\nOil fell sharply to fresh multiyear lows when futures trading opened Sunday evening in New York, with U.S. crude futures sliding 20% to a roughly four-year low of $33.19 a barrel. Brent crude, the global gauge of prices, fell 20% to $36.12 a barrel on the heels of its worst day since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Analysts cautioned that the moves late Sunday were likely to shift due to thin trading volumes and notoriously volatile crude prices. If they held, they would mark some of the biggest one-day swings ever.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nThe declines came after Aramco said in a notice to buyers sent Saturday that it was cutting most of its prices. It slashed its popular medium crude by $7 a barrel to the U.S., by $8 a barrel to Northern Europe and by $6 to the Far East for oil deliveries next month.\n\nThe price cuts are aimed directly at Russia's market share, Saudi officials said, but don't encompass the entirety of the kingdom's strategy, as it is set to boost its crude output as well to 10 million barrels a day, up from about 9.7 million barrels a day in January. The officials said Saudi Arabia would up output next month to above 10 million barrels a day and could increase to its maximum capacity of 12 million barrels a day if needed.\n\nFears of an impending oil-price war sent shares of the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., as the company is formally known, sliding as much as 9% in Sunday trading in Riyadh, dropping below 30 riyals. That takes the stock below the 32 riyals per share level that the company was listed at less than three months ago.\n\nSaudi Arabia flooded the market in 2014 and weakened prices, hoping to undermine U.S. producers. A production hike now would be different because it would come at a time when there is little foreseeable demand for extra Saudi oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia had signaled last week that it was reducing exports by 500,000 barrels a day because of a lack of demand for its oil in China. The Asian powerhouse has reduced its consumption as refineries were forced to shut down and travel became restricted to halt contamination from the deadly coronavirus. Analysts expect the spread of the virus in the rest of Asia as well as Western Europe and the U.S. to further impede appetite for crude.\n\n\"What makes this price war especially dangerous and historic is it breaks out simultaneously with a massive demand shock...from the coronavirus\" said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, a Washington, D.C.-based energy-market consulting firm.\n\n\"We have not seen that toxic combination since the early 1930s when [Texas'] monster Black Giant field started up in the teeth of the Depression, sending crude oil prices down to pennies on the barrel.\"\n\nThe fall in Aramco's shares marks a major blow for the kingdom, which sold a 1.5% stake in the company in December in the world's largest initial public offering. It was billed as a test of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's global standing and a fresh source of funding for his economic reforms.\n\nThe shares have run into a plunge in oil prices and more recently, political upheaval inside the kingdom. Over the weekend, Prince Mohammed launched a broad security crackdown by rounding up royal rivals, government officials and military officers, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday.\n\nThe crown prince had aggressively lobbied Russian President Vladimir Putin to join OPEC in a round of production cuts in recent weeks, fearing the impact of the coronavirus on oil demand -- and on his plans to reform the economy following Aramco's IPO.\n\nFriction between Saudi Arabia and Russia began in early February, when Prince Mohammed asked his father, King Salman, to phone Mr. Putin and to request Russia's cooperation on new output curbs. When the king called, Mr. Putin initially wouldn't make himself available to speak to him. When he did talk to the king, Mr. Putin refused to commit, according to Saudi officials.\n\nMr. Putin didn't seem as concerned about the coronavirus' longer term effects on the oil market, those officials said. Russia's economy is somewhat more diversified than Saudi Arabia's. Also, Russian oil companies have been pressing the Kremlin to boost crude output.\n\nThe world's largest oil producers had met in Vienna, where analysts hoped they would reach an agreement to reduce global supply as worries about the coronavirus weigh on global growth. By the time the gathering began, the Saudis' entreaties had alienated both Mr. Putin and his energy minister Alexander Novak, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMr. Novak has worked closely with his Saudi counterparts in the past but wasn't consulted by them before they reached out to Mr. Putin, the people said.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Novak didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Tadawul stock exchange was closed Friday. But shares in other oil giants tumbled alongside crude prices with Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC both down over 4%.\n\n\"Airlines are cutting back on flights, travel is going right down, traffic is going down, factories are closing, so demand for energy is falling and is going to fall further,\" said Peter Kisler, portfolio manager at London-based North Asset Management.\n\nWrite to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com\n\nRead More", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rory_jones@wsj.com", "name": "Rory Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "avantika_chilkoti@wsj.com", "name": "Avantika Chilkoti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Aramco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_riyal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi riyal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Specialties", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Specialties", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-161975/social", "eventUri": "eng-5586435", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 536}, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 536, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1470566957", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-04", "time": "11:29:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-04T11:29:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-04T11:28:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-is-devastating-the-conference-circuit-11583317802", "title": "Coronavirus Is Devastating the Conference Circuit", "body": "Health risks spur hundreds of cancellations, causing tens of millions of dollars in losses as organizers weigh offering refunds By Collin Eaton, Collin Eaton The Wall Street Journal BiographyCollin Eaton @CollinEatonHC Rebecca Elliott and Rebecca Elliott The Wall Street Journal BiographyRebecca Elliott @rfelliott rebecca.elliott@wsj.com Elizabeth Findell Elizabeth Findell The Wall Street Journal BiographyElizabeth Findell @efindell elizabeth.findell@wsj.com March 4, 2020 5:30 am ET\n\nCoronavirus\n\nLive Updates\n\nWhat We Know\n\nHow to Prepare\n\nYour Questions Answered\n\nLeaders of Austin's South by Southwest festival reassured the public this week that the Texas tech, film and music event would still kick off as planned March 13, despite concerns over the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nBut behind the scenes, Austin politicians, public health officials and others were meeting with organizers to decide whether the show should go on -- and if so, how -- as more than 30,000 people signed an online petition calling for its cancellation and Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. said their employees wouldn't attend.\n\n\"It's a question that is being evaluated and re-evaluated every day,\" Austin Mayor Steve Adler said.\n\nWorld-wide, major conferences and trade shows are getting canceled or postponed at historic rates as the novel coronavirus leads companies to curtail nonessential trips and virus-hit countries restrict travel, leaving organizers with little choice but to call off international gatherings planned for months.\n\nFrom Beijing to San Francisco to Geneva, the cancellations added up to millions of lost visits and tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue for local economies, a tally growing by the hour this week as conferences spanning everything from books and housewares to organic foods shut down.\n\nOrganizers in Asia, Europe and North America have canceled or postponed at least 440 trade shows and exhibitions in response to the coronavirus this year, including scores during the past week, according to German expo trade magazine m+a. The impact was reverberating across everyone from conference sponsors and exhibitors to airport shopkeepers and restaurateurs to hotel clerks and bartenders dependent on tips.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nHave you revised any plans to attend a professional event because of the coronavirus epidemic, or are you considering doing so? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe cancellations raised hard questions for organizers over whether to refund participants for circumstances beyond their control. Some conferences that decided to proceed were also finding that unpopular, as exhibitors demanded refunds amid declining attendance and safety concerns, and at least one major event reversed course and canceled.\n\nStill others that pressed ahead were taking extraordinary measures to minimize risks, such as suggesting that participants avoid handshake greetings.\n\nAlphabet Inc.'s Google said Tuesday it would cancel its splashy annual developer's conference -- its flagship event for the year -- slated for May and held adjacent to the company's Mountain View, Calif., headquarters for roughly 7,000 attendees. A spokeswoman cited concerns around the coronavirus and the health of attendees.\n\nIn Switzerland, the two-week Geneva International Motor Show set to start March 5 was canceled after the government banned public gatherings of more than 1,000 people. The event attracts more than 500,000 visitors annually and was expected to generate between $209 million in $261 million in economic activity.\n\n\"Apart from the first and second world wars, we have never had to cancel the show since 1904,\" said Olivier Rihs, the show's managing director.\n\nIn Spain, cancellation of the Mobile World Congress deprived Barcelona of its busiest annual event, after big companies including AT&T Inc. and Deutsche Telekom AG pulled out. Organizers had forecast it would generate $546 million regionally and create more than 14,000 part-time jobs.\n\n\"It's the best week of the year in economic terms for Barcelona,\" said Roger Pallarols, director of the Barcelona restaurants association, who estimated that the relatively well-heeled clientele typically shells out between 70 and 100 euros per meal.\n\nSeveral conferences decided to postpone until later this year. In San Francisco, the Game Developers Conference set to start March 16 was pushed to summer after major participants including \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games Inc. withdrew. It attracted 29,000 people last year, and the postponement inspired a relief fund for independent game developers and others who suffered losses as a result.\n\nNatural Products Expo West, the world's largest natural and organic foods and products trade show, initially chose to go forward in Anaheim, Calif., this week, even as it estimated that as many as 60% of the expected 87,000 attendees wouldn't come.\n\nBut late Monday, organizer New Hope Network called it off, planning to reschedule it sometime before summer. Some of the world's largest food companies including Nestl\u00e9 SA and Unilever PLC had pulled their exhibits, and retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp. and Whole Foods said they wouldn't have buyers walking the show floor. That spurred dozens of brands to petition the organizers to reschedule and offer credits or refunds.\n\nSome organizers were hiring disease experts and other unusual advisers as they weighed what to do. Dan Kohn, executive director of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which expects 7,000 attendees to its Kubecon conference in Amsterdam at the end of March, said it had opted to go forward for now, with advice from Dr. Joel Selanikio, who helped create a colorful flowchart for expected guests to determine whether they should even show up, based on their recent travels and symptoms.\n\n\"I never thought we'd have a consulting epidemiologist we'd be working with,\" Mr. Kohn said.\n\nFor those dependent on the annual conferences for a chunk of their business, the sudden cancellations were devastating.\n\nJody Fiess, general manager of The Grove, a downtown Houston restaurant, was doing yard work Sunday when an associate texted him: CERAWeek, an energy conference that is one of The Grove's top events of the year, had been canceled for the first time since it was started in 1983.\n\nGone was five days' worth of private event bookings at the restaurant, which can accommodate up to about 700 people in its private dining halls and relies on such events for a large share of its business.\n\n\"It's one of our staples,\" Mr. Fiess said. \"At this time, it's a scrambled state.\"\n\nIHS Markit, the organizer of CERAWeek, estimated it will lose $50 million in nonrecurring revenue because of the event and others it has canceled because of the coronavirus, including a shipping conference scheduled for March 1-2 in Long Beach, Calif. It will fully refund CERAWeek participants, whose standard attendance costs average $8,500.\n\n\"I'm still having a little trouble believing we're not actually doing the event,\" said Daniel Yergin, the conference organizer.\n\nIn Austin, officials and organizers were having daily meetings over whether to proceed with South by Southwest, a premier tourist draw. One option being considered was capping indoor event attendance in line with health authorities' guidelines to reduce close contact, said city public-health spokeswoman Jen Samp.\n\nOrganizers promoted the eclectic list of top speakers and keynote acts at the event, which included NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, musician St. Vincent and filmmaker Lulu Wang. But the list of companies pulling out grew to include Mashable Inc. and Intel Corp.\n\nStill, with the event still on as of Tuesday, some tech industry professionals were thinking of creative ways to greet fellow SXSW attendees, short of a potential germ-transferring handshake. Options discussed included a bow, a foot tap or a fist bump, said Joshua Baer, founder of Austin-based startup accelerator Capital Factory.\n\n\"There's also the Spock live-long-and-prosper,\" Mr. Baer said, referring to the finger-parting hand gesture made famous by \"Star Trek.\"\n\n-- Annie Gasparro, Xavier Fontdegloria, Rolfe Winkler and Jessica Sier contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Elliott at rebecca.elliott@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

give consistent guidance on disease's severity and how the sick can help prevent its spread By Catherine Lucey Catherine Lucey The Wall Street Journal BiographyCatherine Lucey @catherine_lucey catherine.lucey@wsj.com Updated March 5, 2020 7:43 pm ET\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Trump is trying to ease anxieties about coronavirus. Public-health experts say he may be sowing confusion in the process.\n\nMr. Trump drew fresh scrutiny after an interview on Fox News Wednesday in which he questioned the death rate associated with the virus and the severity of its impact on the public.\n\n\"A lot of people will have this, and it's very mild,\" Mr. Trump said to host Sean Hannity. \"They will get better very rapidly. They don't even see a doctor. They don't even call a doctor.\"\n\nHe added: \"So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work -- some of them go to work, but they get better.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that people who are \"mildly ill\" with Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, \"should restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care. Do not go to work, school, or public areas.\"\n\nAmid criticism from Democrats that he wasn't fully explaining the risks of the disease spreading, Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday: \"I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.\"\n\nAs infections have escalated in the U.S, Mr. Trump has urged calm amid tumult in the financial markets and rising public anxiety. He has put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the anti-virus effort, seeking to streamline messaging. He repeatedly stressed that the number of documented cases has been low and that the U.S. government response has been robust.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall sponsored by Fox News on Thursday night, Mr. Trump again sought to calm nerves, saying the economy remained strong and that he liked that people may travel more domestically due to restrictions.\n\n\"It's all going to work out. Everybody has to be calm,\" he said.\n\nBut he has at times seemed to obscure the administration's message by minimizing risks and dispensing information that was incorrect or contradicted by other officials. He has also given varying accounts of the severity of the crisis.\n\nJ. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said there was a \"certain level of inconsistency\" in Mr. Trump's remarks.\n\n\"What is needed right now from the White House is a consistent, coherent message that is based on public health science but also tells the public what we know and don't know and what lies ahead,\" he said.\n\nCrystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the government can diminish credibility when it appears to be issuing mixed messages.\n\n\"It results in a loss of trust in government and authorities,\" said Ms. Watson, who works on public-health emergencies, including infectious diseases.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said that \"the Left and some in the media\" are focused on \"fearful rhetoric and palace intrigue,\" adding that Mr. Pence was leading a \"whole-of-government response in partnership with state and local leaders that includes the best experts on infectious diseases.\"\n\nOn Fox Wednesday, the president also questioned the fatality rate of the virus. The World Health Organization this week stated a mortality rate of 3.4% based on deaths in confirmed cases so far, but experts have cautioned the actual death rate is lower. Other estimates have put it around 2%. The death rate for seasonal flu is typically around 0.1%.\n\nMr. Trump said he had a \"hunch\" it was lower than 3.4%, noting that there could be many undiagnosed cases.\n\n\"You never hear about those people. So, you can't put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu and -- or virus,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nFederal health officials estimated Thursday that the mortality rate for the novel coronavirus is between 0.1% and 1%, lower than estimates of other health organizations. \"The WHO numbers that you see do not take into account the people who don't come into contact with the medical facility,\" said Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nVice President Mike Pence headed to Washington state Thursday to meet with the state's governor to review the virus response. He also stopped in Minnesota, where he met with the CEO of 3M, a company that makes protective masks.\n\nOfficials in Washington state said a 10th person died there Wednesday. All but one of the U.S. deaths linked to the coronavirus have occurred in the state, which has emerged as a hot spot in the virus fight. Washington now has at least 39 confirmed infections, according to its health department.\n\n-- Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

As of Thursday, officials said 18 people in Westchester had been diagnosed with Covid-19, including the man to whom these cases are connected.\n\nHow a Quarantine Grows Since a New Rochelle, N.Y., man fell ill Feb. 22, residents across the region are under quarantine.\n\nPatient's movements\n\n5\n\n5\n\nSecondary effects\n\nWhite Plains\n\n5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nNew Rochelle\n\n6\n\n8\n\nBronx\n\n4\n\nManhattan\n\n7\n\nQueens\n\n5 miles\n\n5 km\n\nPatient returned to his home in New Rochelle, N.Y., after a trip to Miami the weekend of Feb. 15.\n\n1\n\nPatient attended services at Young Israel of New Rochelle Feb. 22 and 23. Attendees are now required to self-quarantine until at least March 8.\n\n2\n\nA neighbor drove the patient to a Bronxville hospital Feb. 27. The neighbor later tested positive, and his children are being tested.\n\n3\n\nThe patient was transferred to a Manhattan hospital March 2.\n\n4\n\nOne New Rochelle resident went to a bat mitzvah in White Plains on March 1, and later tested positive for the virus. Three sisters who also attended were sent home from their Baltimore school March 4 and are now in quarantine.\n\n5\n\nSAR High School in the Bronx, where the patient's 14-year-old daughter attends, closed March 3.\n\n6\n\nOfficials announced that colleagues at the patient's Manhattan law firm are being tested.\n\n7\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo announced on March 4 the patient's wife and children tested positive and are quarantined at home. Yeshiva University, where the patient's 20-year-old son attends, cancelled classes.\n\n8\n\nSources: state and school officials (case details); ESRI (roads); Google (locations)\n\nRabbis said the connectedness of their community is a great strength, but when a contagious illness strikes, the vast network of links among families can make it especially hard to control infection.\n\n\"When you're in a tightknit kind of society, there's lots of opportunities for interaction,\" said Rabbi Yonah Berman at YCT Rabbinical School, in the Bronx's Riverdale section, which has been affected. \"When people are told to step back from that interaction, that's harder than it would be in communities where individuals keep more to themselves.\"\n\nRabbis throughout the New York City area are adjusting the customs of a traditional Jewish culture as they tried to halt the escalation of illness.\n\nThey sent congregations a range of warnings: Please don't kiss the Torah or mezuzah, a small scroll in a case attached to the doorway of many homes. Please don't come to services or ritual baths if you feel any symptoms. And please don't reach out to shake hands lest someone feel obliged to reciprocate.\n\nA Westchester attorney became the second person in New York to test positive for the novel coronavirus on Tuesday. His wife, son and daughter were diagnosed with it as well, state officials said. Only the attorney is hospitalized in serious condition. His family is in quarantine at home in New Rochelle. A neighbor and friends -- five people in a local family -- also tested positive for the virus, officials said.\n\nAs of Thursday, a total of 22 people in New York had the virus, according to state officials.\n\nAfter the attorney was diagnosed, his synagogue, Young Israel of New Rochelle, said it was halting services through Sunday because of potential exposure tied to him. Further, county health officials said people who attended services there on Feb. 22, and a funeral and a bat mitzvah on Feb. 23, must self-quarantine until at least Sunday.\n\nSamuel Heilman, a Queens College professor of sociology quarantined after going to the Feb. 23 funeral, said hundreds of mourners attended the funeral because it was for a founder of the synagogue.\n\nMany congregants \"are neighbors and friends, and live within walking distance,\" he said, and after weekly religious services they have a reception. \"Everyone is eating at the same time, talking and touching each other,\" he said. \"All of those things can increase the likelihood of transfer.\"\n\nWestchester County officials alerted residents about these quarantine rules quickly through email blasts, social media, rabbis and school leaders.\n\nState and county officials said they were working together to identify the universe of people who might have been exposed to individuals known to have coronavirus.\n\nThis is the first instance of community spread in New York. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that such a case could have happened anywhere -- \"and it will.\"\n\nThe governor called the case \"one of the more complicated situations that we've come across because of the number of interconnections that this family has presented.\"\n\nEach infected person is being investigated in an attempt to limit the number of additional infections. The governor said people in self-isolation are being contacted by the county, state, schools or other private organizations.\n\nThe school attended by the daughter of the attorney, SAR High School, said it would remain closed until Wednesday, and its lower school, SAR Academy, will reopen Monday. Some classes were held online.\n\nYeshiva University, where the attorney's son is a student, has canceled classes and events until after March 10.\n\nRabbi Reuven Fink of Young Israel of New Rochelle said in an email to his congregation that obeying the quarantine order is a \"sacred obligation.\"\n\nThe rabbi explained practices that could shift. For example, he said people who need to say Kaddish, a mourner's prayer by a quorum of 10 men, could do it after the quarantine is lifted.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Orthodox Jews lived in New York City, Westchester and Long Island's Suffolk and Nassau counties, according to experts.\n\nMany travel for events. The Jewish Educational Center in Elizabeth, N.J., alerted families Wednesday night that some members of the Elizabeth Jewish community who attended the New Rochelle bat mitzvah last month were in self-quarantine, and none had shown signs of illness.\n\nThree sisters were sent home Wednesday from Bnos Yisroel of Baltimore, a private school, because they went to a March 1 bat mitzvah in White Plains, N.Y., attended by one of the New Rochelle residents who tested positive, school officials said. They said the girls showed no symptoms and are in quarantine.\n\nThe virus hit shortly before Purim, a holiday commemorating the salvation of the Jewish people in ancient Persia. It will be celebrated next week, on Monday night and Tuesday, when families often visit dozens of homes to drop off gifts of food. Several rabbis suggested families scale back such plans.\n\nHigh-Speed Trains, International Flights: How the Coronavirus Spread\n\nRabbi Mark Dratch, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America, the umbrella group for modern Orthodox rabbis, said rabbis planned a conference call Thursday to discuss how congregants who might still be under quarantine could hear the traditional Purim reading of the scroll of Esther on Monday, perhaps by telephone or video hookup.\n\n\"People may be uncomfortable because it's not typical, but because of the emergency nature of the situation, they may have to take advantage of it,\" Mr. Dratch said. Such high-tech alternatives wouldn't work, however, for services on the Sabbath from dusk Friday through Saturday, when Orthodox Jews are barred from using technology, he said.\n\nThe Mikvah of New Rochelle, a facility offering ritual baths, closed Tuesday night and remained shut Wednesday. In New Jersey's Bergen County, the Teaneck Mikvah Association asked clients feeling flulike symptoms to get clearance from their doctors before coming.
