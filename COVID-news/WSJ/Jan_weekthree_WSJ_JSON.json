The virus has already spread outside China, and appeared in South Korea for the first time, officials said Monday.\n\nRelated\n\nVirus in China Is Part of a Growing Threat Coronavirus Prompts Change of Plan for Chinese Holiday: Stay Home\n\nThe World Health Organization said that Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus plans to convene an emergency committee Wednesday to determine whether to declare the outbreak a public-health emergency of international concern. The designation helps the WHO mobilize resources to prevent and combat the spread to other countries.\n\nThe WHO said Monday the spread of the disease was likely the product of \"some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts.\"\n\nThe outbreak is believed to have started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where a number of infected patients were exposed to a large seafood and livestock wholesale market. Coronaviruses most commonly infect mammals, including pigs and cats, but can jump from animals to humans.\n\nThey can also then jump from one human to another. Some patients have said they didn't visit the market and only came into contact with people in Wuhan. The Wuhan market is close to the city's main railway station, an important travel hub in the center of the country.\n\nZhong Nanshan, one of China's most highly regarded epidemiology experts who is leading an expert committee on the outbreak for China's cabinet-level National Health Commission, urged heightened vigilance in a live interview on state broadcaster China Central Television Monday, citing the risk of human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"Right now is the time when we should increase alert,\" said Dr. Zhong, who rose to national prominence nearly two decades ago as an authoritative voice during China's fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. In that outbreak, a similar coronavirus killed 774 people after its emergence in southern China beginning in late 2002.\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nHow worried are you about the new virus spreading from central China? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe new warnings came on a day when the number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus more than tripled to 218, according to Chinese state media and health authorities, including in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern metropolis of Shenzhen -- three of the country's biggest and most affluent cities.\n\nFifteen medical staff involved in treating the new coronavirus have themselves been infected with the disease, authorities in Wuhan said. It is unclear whether these medical staff members were included in the reported patient figures.\n\nOne reason for the rapid increase in reported cases is that a diagnostic test for the virus is now available. That means infections that would otherwise have gone unnoticed are being identified. U.S. health officials said last week that they expect more cases to be diagnosed in China and other countries as testing for the virus expands.\n\nYang Gonghuan, the former deputy head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a separate interview with the China Business Journal newspaper Monday that human-to-human transmission of the disease had occurred.\n\nThe sudden increase in cases is likely to spark questions over the transparency of disclosures by Chinese health authorities.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping earlier Monday urged authorities to make efforts to prevent and control the spreading infection, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. Officials should \"release outbreak information in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation,\" he said.\n\nChina is working with other countries to prevent and control the outbreak, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular media briefing in Beijing on Monday. \"We've formulated prevention and control plans, treated patients, monitored their close contacts, conducted epidemiological research and released information in a timely manner,\" he said.\n\nSouth Korean authorities said Monday that a 35-year-old Chinese woman who had flown into the country from Wuhan had contracted the coronavirus.\n\nSpread of the Virus\n\nSince it first appeared in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last month, a newly identified coronavirus has spread across China and into neighboring countries.\n\nNew coronavirus cases\n\nConfirmed cases\n\nDeaths\n\nWuhan\n\n1\n\n3\n\nJapan\n\n7\n\nsouth\n\nKorea\n\nChina\n\n6\n\n5\n\n1\n\nGuangdong province\n\nBeijing\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\nThailand\n\nBangkok\n\nShanghai\n\n4\n\n5\n\n500 miles\n\n4\n\nIncheon, South Korea\n\nKanagawa, Japan\n\n500 km\n\n7\n\n6\n\nConfirmed cases\n\nDeaths\n\nWuhan\n\n1\n\n3\n\nJapan\n\n7\n\nsouth\n\nKorea\n\nChina\n\n6\n\n5\n\n1\n\nGuangdong province\n\nBeijing\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\nThailand\n\nBangkok\n\nShanghai\n\n4\n\n5\n\n500 miles\n\n4\n\n500 km\n\nKanagawa, Japan\n\nIncheon, S.

The statement said 35 of those cases were severe, while nine were critical.\n\nThe fourth infected person to die was an 89-year-old man who suffered high blood pressure and diabetes, Wuhan authorities said. A third infected patient died over the weekend, authorities said without offering details. In the case of the two earlier fatalities, authorities previously said the men suffered from existing illnesses.\n\nOn top of confirmed cases, suspected cases have sprung up in a number of Chinese provinces, including Shandong on the east coast, Sichuan in the interior and Yunnan and Guangxi on the southwestern border with Vietnam, according to CCTV's report Monday. Separately, five suspected cases were reported by health authorities in coastal Zhejiang province, just south of Shanghai on the country's east coast. Shanghai health authorities on Tuesday reported four suspected cases.\n\nRelated\n\nVirus Is Part of a Growing Threat Chinese Drugmakers' Shares Surge, Travel Stocks Fall Chinese Stick Closer to Home Over Holiday as Virus Spreads\n\nThe newly discovered coronavirus so far is significantly less deadly than SARS. However, it is in the same class of pathogens, and this outbreak is clearly larger than scientists and officials initially believed.\n\nThe availability of detection kits at more Chinese hospitals will likely lead to more confirmed cases, said David Hui, an infectious disease specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nDr. Zhong, the Chinese epidemiologist, told CCTV on Monday that transmission from wild animals to humans was a \"big possibility.\"\n\nHis frank acknowledgment of human-to-human transmission was a notable break from earlier statements by Chinese authorities who rated the risk of human-to-human transmission as being relatively low. Chinese health authorities are urging people to wear face masks and to report quickly to a hospital if they have a fever.\n\nIn an exchange with state media, Dr. Zhong cited two cases in Guangdong where the patients hadn't traveled to Wuhan but were in contact with family members returning from there.\n\nIn many cases, patients did travel to Wuhan and showed symptoms of fever and fatigue.\n\nThe Chinese patient in South Korea had flown into Incheon International Airport from Wuhan and was quarantined by airport authorities before being transferred to a medical center for treatment, according to South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn Shanghai, two confirmed cases were patients who traveled from Wuhan, according to the city's health authorities.\n\nBeijing has five confirmed cases, according to state media; a district authority has said that two patients had returned from Wuhan.\n\nOne of the confirmed cases in southern Guangdong province is 10 years old, according to local authorities. Most of the other infected patients who have been identified by authorities were elderly.\n\n-- Betsy McKay, Xiao Xiao, Natasha Khan, Wenxin Fan and Eun-Young Jeong contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com and Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nThe fourth infected person to die from the coronavirus was an 89-year-old man who suffered high blood pressure and diabetes, Wuhan authorities said. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that he was 86 years old. (Jan. 20, 2019)\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

a city of about 7.5 million people, is about 35 miles east of Wuhan By Stephanie Yang and Yoko Kubota Updated Jan. 23, 2020 6:54 pm ET\n\nBEIJING -- Two more Chinese cities were put on lockdown by the government on Thursday, as authorities in the Chinese gambling center of Macau said they were weighing closures of its casinos, expanding an unprecedented experiment to try to contain a fast-spreading virus that has killed 18 people and infected more than 600.\n\nThe World Health Organization on Thursday declined to declare the outbreak a global public health emergency, citing a limited number of cases abroad and efforts under way to bring it under control.\n\nOn Thursday, authorities in Huanggang -- a Chinese city of 7.5 million people -- said they wouldn't let long-distance trains and buses run from the urban center and would shut its public transportation system in the lockdown zone, effective midnight Friday local time. Ezhou, another neighboring city with just over a million residents, said it would enact similar restrictions, bringing the total number of cities with travel restrictions to three.\n\nHuanggang is about 35 miles east of Wuhan, a city of 11 million and a major hub for travel, where the new pneumonia-causing coronavirus originated. Wuhan just hours earlier halted outbound trains and flights and shut down its public-transportation system.\n\nThe Huanggang local government also said movie theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment and cultural facilities in the city center would temporarily halt operations and a central market would be shut down for an indefinite period. Starting Thursday, the local government said it would inspect every person and car entering and exiting the urban center.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nHow do you think Chinese cities are handling the spread of the coronavirus? Do you agree with the lockdown measures? Join the conversation below.\n\nBesides Wuhan, Huangguang and Ezhou, which collectively hold more than 20 million people, five other cities in the province of Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital, enacted travel restrictions late Thursday.\n\nSeparately, the chief executive of Macau, the Chinese special administrative region that is the world's biggest gambling market, said Thursday he was considering closing all of the territory's 40-some casinos, following the confirmation of a second coronavirus infection case there, government-run broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong reported.\n\nThe Hong Kong government confirmed its first two cases of the new coronavirus Thursday evening and said some people who had been in close contact with them were quarantined at one of the centers the government has set up at campsites. One close contact was suspected of being infected, the government said.\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Health also confirmed its first case of the coronavirus Thursday evening. A 66-year-old Chinese tourist from Wuhan became the city-state's first case of the virus. the tourist developed a sore throat on the flight to Singapore, then a fever and cough, the ministry said in a statement. One of his travel companions, a 37-year-old male, is suspected to carry the virus, the ministry added.\n\nThe WHO, in explaining its decision not to declare a global public health emergency, said it was still too early for such a move, although the emergency committee that studied the outbreak was divided on the matter, according to the committee chairman, Didier Houssin.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhamom Ghebreyesus said he would reconvene the committee if the situation changes -- even if that happens in the next couple of days.\n\n\"This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency,\" he said. \"It may yet become one.\"\n\nBy imposing blanket restrictions on people's movement, Chinese authorities are doubling down on a high-stakes strategy that experts say is an untested approach to dealing with infectious diseases.\n\n\"To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science. It has not been tried before as a public-health measure, so we cannot at this stage say it will or will not work,\" Gauden Galea, the WHO's country representative for China, said in an interview Thursday with the Associated Press, referring to the Wuhan lockdown.\n\nMr. Galea added that while such a radical measure \"obviously has social and economic impacts that are considerable,\" it also \"demonstrates a very strong public health commitment and a willingness to take dramatic action.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nRelief and Panic in the Rush to Catch Last Trains From Wuhan China Locks Down City at Center of Outbreak Heard on the Street: Wuhan Coronavirus Could Hit China's Economy Harder Than SARS What We Know About the Coronavirus\n\nTom Inglesby, an expert on epidemics who is director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said \"large-scale quarantine efforts in the past have not been successful in changing the outcome of disease outbreaks.\"\n\nChinese authorities have suggested the coronavirus is spreading between people primarily through coughing, kissing or contact with saliva. It emerged from a seafood and livestock market in Wuhan and has spread across China and into the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Thailand.\n\nOn Thursday, Chinese health authorities said the coronavirus had reached the northeastern and northwestern corners of China, including the provinces of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia, and Xinjiang, the majority Muslim region that borders Kazakhstan. Jilin province, in the country's northeast, and Jiangsu province, just north of Shanghai, also reported their first cases. The total confirmed cases in China rose to more than 600, according to state media.\n\nThe decision to ban people from leaving or entering Wuhan rippled across China and beyond its borders, sparking confusion and elevating fears about a growing contagion ahead of the Lunar New Year, the busiest travel period of the year in China and many other parts of Asia.\n\nCoronavirus Cases A newly identified virus that originated in a livestock market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has spread across China and into the U.S.\n\nNote: Totals as of midnight Beijing time, Jan. 23\n\nSources: China Central Television; local governments\n\nIn Tokyo and Seoul, face masks and hand sanitizer disappeared from some store shelves, while across China, seven movie openings were scrapped as film studios and theaters worried about moviegoers fearful of setting foot outside. In Wuhan, a boxing qualifier for this year's Olympic Games in Tokyo slated to take place starting Feb. 3 was canceled by the local organizing committee.\n\nPrimary and secondary schools in Hubei have postponed reopening after Lunar New Year to an undetermined date, according to the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily. In Beijing, major events over the holiday were canceled.\n\nJapan and the U.S. each raised their alert levels for travel to Wuhan. Tokyo advised its citizens not to travel to the city unless necessary, while Washington recommended exercising caution but stopped short of advising travelers to avoid the city.\n\nIn Wuhan, local authorities urged calm, calling on citizens not to panic or hoard supplies. \"With the close care of General Secretary Xi Jinping, \" a government notice read, \"Wuhan has sufficient reserves and smooth supplies of commodities, food and medical protection products.\"\n\nOperators from the transportation-service hotline in Wuhan said more than 8,000 buses in the city and all nine subway lines had stopped running as of 10 a.m. Thursday. Many entrances to the highway from the Wuhan area were closed, while vehicles could still get off the highway and enter the city, according to the local highway information service early Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, a few flights continued to depart Wuhan's Tianhe International Airport even after the 10 a.m. lockdown began, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware. Most of the flights were transiting through Wuhan from other cities, though some direct flights -- including to Beijing and Paris -- were among those allowed to take off after the lockdown deadline.\n\nWithin Wuhan's city limits, people expressed frustrations online over a lack of transportation services and dwindling resources at hospitals. The Wuhan Health Commission acknowledged long lines outside fever clinics and a shortage of hospital beds. It said the city was designating more hospitals as centers for fever patients.\n\nThe central government is shipping 10,000 sets of protective clothing and 50,000 sets of gloves to Wuhan from its reserve medical supplies, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information, which posted the information through its account on the Twitter -like Weibo service.\n\nThe Finance Ministry said late Thursday that it is giving out 1 billion yuan ($144 million) in emergency subsidies to Hubei province to fight the coronavirus.\n\n-- Lekai Liu, Yin Yijun, Bingyan Wang, Betsy McKay and Liza Lin contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com and Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com\n\nThe What's News Briefing In Your Inbox\n\nGet What's News, a daily digest of the day's most important news to watch, delivered to your inbox.

@betswrites Betsy.McKay@wsj.com Updated Jan. 20, 2020 3:32 pm ET\n\nThe virus implicated in a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia in central China is in a class of pathogens that are a growing player in global infectious-disease epidemics.\n\nA leading Chinese health official said this week that the virus has spread between humans, confirming a chief concern of authorities as the disease is transmitted around the country and across Asia.\n\nThe outbreak, which originated in the city of Wuhan, has sickened more than 200 people, and three have died, according to Chinese state media and health officials.\n\nWuhan has all the ingredients for a coronavirus outbreak, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and other experts say: a big, densely populated city with live animal markets where people and possibly infected pigs, bats or other mammals mingle.\n\nEpidemic Potential\n\nCoronaviruses are jumping increasingly from animals to humans, creating new threats\n\nNL63 (1100s)\n\nSARS (2003)\n\n229E (1800s)\n\nMERS (2012)\n\nOC43 (1800s)\n\nWuhan CoV (2020)\n\nHKU1 (unknown)\n\nSource: Timothy Sheahan, University of North Carolina\n\nCoronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect mostly pigs, cats and other animals. They can also jump from animals to humans, and from one human to another. Outbreaks in recent years have killed thousands of pigs in China.\n\nSeven strains are known to infect humans, including the virus in Wuhan, causing illnesses in the respiratory tract. Four of those strains cause common colds. Two others, by contrast, rank among the deadliest of human infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.\n\nNamed for crown-like spikes on their surfaces, coronaviruses mutate rapidly, essentially making mistakes easily as they copy their genome to produce offspring. \"They can recombine with incredibly high efficiency,\" said Ralph Baric, a coronavirus expert and professor of epidemiology at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina. Two or three coronaviruses in the same cell can mix and produce new offspring viruses quickly, he said.\n\nRelated\n\nCoronavirus Is Spreading Quickly Across China as Confirmed Cases Triple New Virus Discovered by Chinese Scientists Investigating Pneumonia Outbreak Health Officials Work to Solve China's Mystery Virus Outbreak Predicting the Next Pandemic China's Leaders Are Penned In as Citizens Stomach High Pork Prices\n\nThe reservoir, or natural home, of the coronavirus is believed to be in bats. But the virus jumps easily from one host to another, evolving as it moves. Investigators searching for the source of the SARS virus first found it in civet cats, an animal often eaten in the region of southern China where humans first were infected. Later, they traced it to bats found at the same markets where the civet cats were sold.\n\nNew, more severe human coronaviruses are emerging at an accelerating pace. Since 2002, three new types of coronavirus have emerged: SARS, MERS, and now this new one in Wuhan.\n\nSARS changed the game for virologists as the first coronavirus that was deadly to humans. Before that, it was known as a virus causing common colds. MERS is even deadlier. It also infects people on a continuing basis, unlike SARS, which disappeared after causing one epidemic that shook up global public health.\n\nThe new Wuhan virus appears milder, though some people have been severely ill and three have died.\n\nMore new human coronaviruses are likely to emerge, said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. organization that identifies and researches emerging viruses around the world, including tracing SARS and MERS to bats. \"Our ecology is changing,\" he said. \"We're exposed more to animal pathogens.\"\n\nCoronaviruses are \"well poised to take advantage of a more densely populated planet with integrated farm methods that bring large numbers of animals together to feed populations,\" said Dr. Baric.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nHow has the outbreak in China affected your travel plans? Join the conversation below.\n\nPopulations are aging, too, and coronavirus causes more severe illnesses in people over age 65.\n\nResearchers have traced about 100 or more SARS-related coronaviruses circulating in bats in China, Dr. Daszak said. Some can infect humans, lab experiments show, he said. The Wuhan strain is similar to bat coronaviruses that led to SARS, scientists say.\n\nOne question is whether the Wuhan strain will recede, like SARS, or continue to cause outbreaks, like MERS, Dr. Osterholm said.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe Wuhan outbreak demonstrates how urgent the need is for drugs to treat emerging coronaviruses, said Timothy Sheahan, an assistant professor of epidemiology at UNC's Gillings School of Global Public Health. In a paper published Friday in Nature Communications, he and colleagues showed that an antiviral drug by Gilead Sciences Inc., remdesivir, lessened lung disease from MERS in mice. He hopes to study the effects of the drug on the new Wuhan strain.

It has now killed at least 56 people and infected more than 2,000 others.\n\nThe developments reflect heightened vigilance and fear over a newly identified coronavirus. Little about the virus is understood, including its origin, how easily it transmits from person to person and how long it takes for an infected individual to display symptoms.\n\nLoad Error\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nAfter staying largely silent in public about the outbreak since it first emerged in central China last month, Mr. Xi on Saturday convened a special meeting of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, calling for a more centralized response to the epidemic and asserting personal responsibility in addressing the crisis.\n\n\"When an epidemic breaks out, a command is issued. It is our responsibility to prevent and control it,\" Mr. Xi said, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.\n\nHe called for the new high-level committee to \"address concerns within and outside the country,\" indirectly referencing mounting global concern about the epidemic, which Mr. Xi described as a \"grave situation\" that was accelerating.\n\n\"We definitely can win the battle to contain the epidemic,\" he said.\n\nAt the center of the epidemic, Liang Wudong, a doctor who had worked for many years at one of the Wuhan hospitals where coronavirus patients are being treated, died on Saturday morning.\n\nThe Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the People's Daily, said on its English-language Twitter account that Dr. Liang had died of the coronavirus, and portrayed him as a hero for having been \"at the front line fighting against\" the coronavirus. It is not clear if Dr. Liang -- an ear, nose and throat specialist who had retired last year -- was involved in the treatment of other patients.\n\nOn Saturday, China announced further restrictions on the movement of its people, banning private vehicles from the streets of central Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the outbreak began, and blocking the departure of all overseas group tours beginning Monday for an indefinite period of time.\n\nTravel agencies also were ordered to stop selling air tickets and hotel services for travel within China. And Beijing authorities said all road transportation leaving Beijing for other provinces, such as on buses, would be halted starting Sunday.\n\nSanya, a city on the southern tourist island of Hainan, said it would close all of its tourist sites starting Saturday, after Beijing shut the Forbidden City and sections of the Great Wall indefinitely.\n\nThe restrictions came after days in which Wuhan and more than a dozen surrounding cities put residents on lockdown, halting almost all inbound and outbound travel in an extraordinary attempt to prevent the virus from spreading further.\n\nIn Hong Kong, authorities raised the Chinese territory's epidemic alert level to the highest level of emergency and suspended school classes for two extra weeks. The measures were a response to three new coronavirus cases that were confirmed there on Saturday, all Wuhan natives who had arrived in Hong Kong over the past week. All three are in their early 60s with a previous history of good health and hadn't visited the Wuhan livestock market believed to be the source of the coronavirus.\n\nMalaysia, meanwhile, reported its first three cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, as Japan confirmed a third case of its own. Canada said the country has its first \"presumptive positive\" case of the virus.\n\nIn Taiwan, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday the island would refuse entry to tour groups from Hubei, Wuhan's home province, and immediately send back any such tour groups that were already in Taiwan. A day earlier, Taiwan had reported its third coronavirus case.\n\nWithin China, the cabinet-level National Health Commission said Saturday it is sending 1,230 medical experts to Wuhan, and the People's Liberation Army said it had sent 450 medical personnel from the country's military medical universities to assist in caring for pneumonia patients at Wuhan's hospitals.\n\nThe Wuhan Health Commission said it would requisition 24 general hospitals and turn them into designated hospitals for coronavirus patients, adding 6,000 more beds by the end of the month. Two other hospitals are now being built in hopes of adding thousands of beds to Wuhan's health system in a matter of days.\n\nThe central government said it would send three million face masks, 114,000 protective suits and 110,000 pairs of medical gloves to Wuhan, according to state broadcaster China Central Television.\n\nDr. Liang, who was 62 years old, had worked at one of Wuhan's top hospitals, the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese & Western Medicine, also known as Hubei Xinhua Hospital, according to an official account run by Hubei health authorities. Dr. Liang fell ill last week and was transferred to the Wuhan Medical Treatment Center, also known as Jinyintan Hospital, the account read. Both hospitals have been among the main institutions treating coronavirus patients.\n\nAlso on Saturday, a 2-year-old Chinese girl became the youngest patient confirmed to date. She is a native of Wuhan who traveled earlier this past week to the southwestern Chinese region of Guangxi, which borders Vietnam. She began sneezing and developing a fever, and was transferred to a nearby hospital for care, officials said.\n\nWrite to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com and Yoko Kubota at

days before Beijing locked down Wuhan, thousands gathered for a Lunar New Year banquet By Lingling Wei and Lingling Wei The Wall Street Journal BiographyLingling Wei Lingling.Wei@wsj.com Chao Deng Chao Deng The Wall Street Journal BiographyChao Deng @chao_deng chao.deng@wsj.com Updated Jan. 24, 2020 1:55 am ET\n\nOn Sunday, more than 10,000 families gathered in Wuhan for a banquet, sharing dishes including spicy duck necks and braised prawns, in a tradition the government had held for years to mark the Lunar New Year.\n\nDays later, Beijing made the unprecedented decision to lock down the city of 11 million people, shutting public transportation, movie theaters, internet cafes and other cultural centers, in an effort to contain the spread of a virus that has killed at least 18 people.\n\nSome medical professionals questioned the timing of the mass gathering.\n\n\"Having a big event like this at a time of an epidemic amounts to a lack of basic common sense,\" said Li Xinzhou, a respiratory specialist in Shanghai.\n\nAs China tries to control a coronavirus outbreak that has spread halfway around the world since it was first disclosed in December, it is also facing questions about the pace at which the outbreak was confronted.\n\nWuhan and the nearby cities of Huanggang and Ezhou, which collectively hold more than 20 million people, have been put on lockdown, while authorities in the Chinese gambling center of Macau said they were weighing closures of its casinos. Five other cities in the province of Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital, also enacted travel restrictions late Thursday.\n\nGlobal Coronavirus Cases\n\nDeath\n\nConfirmed\n\nNORTH AMERICA\n\nU.S.: 1\n\nASIA\n\nMainland China:\n\n830 cases, 25 deaths\n\nJapan: 2\n\nSouth Korea: 1\n\nTaiwan: 1\n\nHong Kong: 2\n\nMacau: 2\n\nVietnam: 2\n\nThailand: 3\n\nSingapore: 1\n\nNote: As of early Beijing time, Jan. 24.\n\nSources: Local health authorities\n\nSuch drastic measures indicate that the virus, for which no cure has yet been found, is spreading faster than previously anticipated.\n\nMany international health experts have credited Chinese officials with responding more quickly, and with greater transparency, than they did during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, 17 years ago, which claimed nearly 800 lives and infected more than 8,000 people world-wide.\n\nBut people close to the Wuhan government, including advisers and business executives with which it consults, said officials remained overly optimistic that the outbreak would be contained while they focused on other priorities, including annual Communist Party meetings there.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday with China's state broadcaster China Central Television, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang said local authorities \"weren't on alert enough\" when they organized Sunday's banquet. Wuhan authorities didn't respond to requests from The Wall Street Journal for further comment.\n\nThe same day as the banquet, Beijing dispatched a group of the nation's prominent epidemiologists to Wuhan. They determined the virus -- initially spread from animals -- had been transferred between people for some time, but didn't say for how long, before authorities publicly acknowledged such human-to-human contact was likely, increasing its potential danger.\n\nThe group's leader, Zhong Nanshan, said in a state-television interview that it had found that more than a dozen medical staff in Wuhan had contracted the virus from one patient, though he didn't say when that had occurred.\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 600 people in mainland China and a handful in countries including Thailand, South Korea and the U.S. It is fast becoming one of the biggest crises and political tests for President Xi Jinping, who has portrayed China as a responsible world power amid heightened tensions with the U.S. and other Western countries.\n\nTo contain the surge in infections, Mr. Xi this week ordered the travel bans for cities hit hard by the virus, an official familiar with the president's role in the decision said.\n\nThe World Health Organization says the scale of such a shutdown is without precedent and it remains to be seen how effective the measures will be. The WHO declined on Thursday to declare the outbreak a global public-health emergency, citing a limited number of cases abroad and efforts under way to bring it under control.\n\nChinese officials said Mr. Xi is determined to avoid a repeat of SARS. But some privately say his top-down style of leadership has also made lower-level bureaucrats wary of acting decisively on their own.\n\n\"Xi's leadership style has effectively instilled a 'wait and see' attitude within the bureaucracy,\" said Jude Blanchette, a China specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank. That, he said, \"is leading to slow and hesitant responses from government officials as they wait for pronouncements from Beijing before taking action.\"\n\nChinese social media in December made the first references to the virus, prompting health authorities in Wuhan to confirm on Dec. 31 that 27 people had been sickened and to close a wholesale wild-animal market where the virus was suspected to have originated. Within a week, reported infections surged to 44.\n\nChina informed the WHO of the initial outbreak soon after it was discovered. By early January, Chinese health authorities identified the genome of the virus and determined it was in the same family of pathogens as SARS, a notable breakthrough for the domestic scientific community.\n\nWuhan authorities didn't step up public warnings about the virus, but around the start of the year temporarily detained eight people they alleged had spread false information about the virus, without giving any evidence. For weeks, local officials insisted there was a low risk the virus could be passed from human to human.\n\nWhen the city's top leaders met over several days this month for annual policy meetings -- typically held to summarize the government's accomplishments for the year and lay out goals for the next -- the virus wasn't on the official agenda, even though some officials privately questioned the city's response.\n\n\"Everyone was blindly optimistic,\" an adviser to the Wuhan government said. The focus at the time, the adviser said, was to maintain the facade of stability.\n\n\"This is where they truly messed up,\" potentially missing an opportunity to more easily contain the outbreak while the sessions were under way, said Dali Yang, a Chinese politics expert at the University of Chicago.\n\nSoon, hospitals throughout Wuhan and nearby cities were reporting more cases to the National Health Commission in Beijing, a cabinet-level group. The surge was serious enough that the committee sent the epidemiologists to Wuhan on Sunday.\n\nThe group, led by Mr. Zhong, a prominent veteran of the SARS epidemic, concluded that the situation was more severe than local authorities had publicly acknowledged, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe group decided authorities should shut the city, but provincial and municipal officials had no authority to do so, so the team had to return to Beijing, where Mr. Xi eventually signed off on the measure.\n\nHe issued a directive on Monday urging authorities to \"take effective measures to resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic\" and instructed the central government to set up a task force to tackle the outbreak.\n\nThe Wuhan lockdown was announced Thursday morning, less than a day after the senior-most Hubei province officials spent the evening at a Wuhan concert hall enjoying a gala. Some people flashed resentment when the lockdown became public.\n\n\"If measures had been taken in advance, there would be no need to lock down the city,\" one user on the Weibo microblogging site wrote. \"With the city being blocked now, it shows the situation is already out of control.\"\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nChina's National Health Commission was incorrectly referred to as the National Health Committee in an earlier version of this article.

Osipovich Alexander Osipovich The Wall Street Journal BiographyAlexander Osipovich @aosipovich alexander.osipovich@wsj.com Updated Jan. 24, 2020 4:37 pm ET\n\nU.S. stocks dropped Friday, ending the week lower, on worries the deadly coronavirus outbreak is spreading.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 170.36 points, or 0.6%, to 28989.73, declining below the 29000 level that it crossed for the first time earlier this month.\n\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 30.07 points, or 0.9% to 3295.47 in its steepest one-day drop since October. The Nasdaq Composite lost 87.57 points, or 0.9%, to close at 9314.91.\n\nAll three indexes opened higher Friday morning, but pulled back after health officials confirmed a second U.S. case of the coronavirus. It has killed more than two dozen people in Asia, sickened hundreds more and led to a quarantine of the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\nAll three indexes posted losses for the week, ending two-week winning streaks for the Dow and S&P and snapping a six-week winning streak for the Nasdaq.\n\nThe benchmarks are still within 1.3% of the record highs set in recent days before jitters over the Wuhan virus spooked investors.\n\nThe crude oil market had its worst week since July as the widening outbreak threatened to disrupt travel. U.S. oil futures fell 2.5% to $54.19 on Friday, in their fourth consecutive day of losses.\n\nInvestors bought assets seen as havens. Gold futures gained 0.4% to settle at $1571.10 a troy ounce. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.680%, from 1.739% on Thursday, as investors snapped up government bonds. Bond yields move in the opposite direction from prices.\n\nUtilities were the only one of the S&P 500's 11 sectors to rise on the day.\n\nIn corporate news, shares of Intel surged $5.15, or 8.1%, to $68.47. The chip maker late Thursday reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations following an upswing in personal-computer shipments and robust demand for chips to power data centers.\n\nAmerican Express gained $3.74 a share, or 2.8%, to $135.11 after the credit-card company's earnings beat analysts' expectations and it gave an optimistic earnings outlook for 2020.\n\nOverseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index climbed 0.9% on fresh economic data that signaled a halt to the slowdown in the German manufacturing sector.\n\nPreliminary data on purchasing managers' indexes, closely watched measures of business activity, suggested that the manufacturing sector in the eurozone -- and Germany, in particular -- fared better than the market had expected in January. Factories in the region saw export orders begin to stabilize after a long and deep decline, and while the manufacturing sector continued to contract, it did so at a slower pace than previous months.\n\n\"The markets are reacting to the signs of bottoming in German manufacturing,\" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"It's pretty key because the big question on everyone's mind has been: Is there recession risk? And the most obvious risk there was a downturn in European manufacturing.\"\n\nU.K. stocks rose, with the FTSE 100 index climbing 1% after the latest purchasing managers index data was better than analysts expected.\n\nThe readings are \"the surest sign yet that the economy has turned a corner since the election,\" analysts at Capital Economics said in a note.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark closed up 0.1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng finished the day up almost 0.2%. Chinese and Korean markets were closed for public holidays.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com and Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Yangtze and Hanshui rivers is a major trade hub in central China By Costas Paris Costas Paris The Wall Street Journal BiographyCostas Paris @CostasParis costas.paris@wsj.com Jan. 23, 2020 11:58 am ET\n\nChina has started holding back some ships from calling at the city of Wuhan, a major trade hub on the Yangtze River, as the country seeks to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus\n\n\"There isn't a central order to stop ships, but more than a dozen that were supposed to call [at Wuhan] over the past two days are held down river,\" said Zhang Yong, a tug captain at the city's port. \"There are health warnings to wash hands, don't touch your mouth and go to a doctor if you feel sick. I wear a mask, people are getting scared and I hope it's sorted out soon because it will hurt business a lot,\" he said.\n\nBarge operators in Wuhan confirmed that fewer ships have been coming into the port and leaving it, causing delays to cargo.\n\nThe disruption at the commercial trade center come as authorities expand a expand a lockdown in central China. Beijing halted outbound trains and flights from Wuhan, where the virus originated, on Thursday and announced similar actions in the nearby cities of Huanggang and Ezhou.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe attempts to isolate a virus that has killed at least 17 people and infected more than 500 have primarily involved limiting the movement of people. The port precautions show how they could hit China's industrial economy.\n\nWuhan, an industrial city of 11 million people, is an important river port that handles close to 1.5 million containers a year, along with thousands of tons of coal, steel, crude and fertilizer cargoes. The port also handles tens of thousands of passengers and tourists.\n\nCalls to Wuhan Port Affairs Group, the state entity that runs the port, weren't answered, but a port official at Huanggang, about 35 miles east of Wuhan, said barge traffic at that part of the Yangtze had slowed down\n\nThey are spraying some containers before they go on ships and there is some congestion up the river as ships stay anchored. Big liners keep on coming in, but crews are asked to stay onboard and captains ask customs to wear protective gear before entering the ships,\" the official, who asked not to be named, said.\n\nShip insurers said that ports could be quarantined if the virus spreads.\n\nMore on logistics\n\nReport Puts $1 Trillion Price Tag on Cutting Ship Carbon Emissions January 21, 2020 Djibouti Rejects Court Ruling to Hand Back Container Terminal January 17, 2020\n\n\"Apart from the obvious danger to crew members of contracting the illness at a port in an infected area, port authorities may institute reporting and quarantine measures to guard against the spread of the disease from vessels that have previously called at infected ports, and in the most severe cases of outbreak ports may be closed altogether,\" said Rohan Bray, chief executive of insurance major Steamship Mutual in Hong Kong.\n\nMr. Bray added that the epidemic \"would have to escalate substantially before owners could consider legitimately refusing to call at scheduled or ordered ports on account of the safety of the crew.\"\n\nBig European liners and China's Cosco Shipping Holdings Co. said they hadn't altered their Chinese services, but brokers said they have seen delays in services between Yokohama, Japan, and Wuhan. Some gas carriers were also held back Thursday from calling at Wuhan, brokers said.\n\nPorts in China and elsewhere have remained open in previous disease outbreaks. Asian seaports operated without major disruptions during the 2002-2003 crisis over severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed around 800 people, mostly in China and Hong Kong. Ports in West Africa continued to handle cargo and passengers during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak which killed more than 11,000 people.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Wuhan, the center of the epidemic, is a transit hub with high-speed rail connections to some of China's most populated cities.\n\nBeijing\n\n100 miles\n\n100 km\n\nWuhan\n\nOfficials canceled all outbound trains, ferries, buses and flights and closed down local bus and metro service beginning at 10 a.m. local time on Jan. 23.\n\nShanghai\n\nXiantao\n\nCHINA\n\nHuanggang\n\nJingmen\n\nHuangshi\n\nDangyang\n\nEzhou\n\nChengdu\n\nZhijiang\n\nXianning\n\nQianjiang\n\nChibi\n\nChongqing\n\nGuangzhou\n\nHONG\n\nKONG\n\nHigh-speed rail\n\nCities on full or partial lockdown\n\nPopulation density\n\nHigh\n\nCities on full or partial lockdown, population: 30M\n\nU.S.'s three largest cities,\n\npopulation: 15M\n\nEzhou\n\nDangyang\n\nHuanggang\n\n6 million\n\nNew York City\n\nLos Angeles\n\n4 million\n\n8 million\n\nQianjiang\n\nZhijiang\n\nHuangshi\n\nXiantao\n\nWuhan\n\n11 million\n\nXianning\n\nChicago\n\nJingmen\n\nBeijing\n\n100 miles\n\n100 km\n\nWuhan\n\nOfficials canceled all outbound trains, ferries, buses and flights and closed down local bus and metro service beginning at 10 a.m. local time on Jan. 23.\n\nShanghai\n\nXiantao\n\nCHINA\n\nHuanggang\n\nJingmen\n\nHuangshi\n\nDangyang\n\nEzhou\n\nChengdu\n\nZhijiang\n\nXianning\n\nQianjiang\n\nChongqing\n\nGuangzhou\n\nHONG\n\nKONG\n\nHigh-speed rail\n\nCities on full or partial lockdown\n\nPopulation density\n\nHigh\n\nCities on full or partial lockdown, population: 30M\n\nU.S.'s three largest cities,\n\npopulation: 15M\n\nEzhou\n\nDangyang\n\nHuanggang\n\n6 million\n\nNew York City\n\nLos\n\nAngeles\n\nQianjiang\n\nZhijiang\n\n8 million\n\n4 million\n\nHuangshi\n\nXiantao\n\nWuhan\n\n11 million\n\nXianning\n\nChicago\n\nJingmen\n\nBeijing\n\n100 miles\n\n100 km\n\nWuhan\n\nOfficials canceled all outbound trains, ferries, buses and flights and closed down local bus and metro service beginning at 10 a.m. local time on Jan. 23.\n\nShanghai\n\nXiantao\n\nCHINA\n\nHuanggang\n\nJingmen\n\nHuangshi\n\nDangyang\n\nEzhou\n\nChengdu\n\nZhijiang\n\nXianning\n\nQianjiang\n\nChongqing\n\nGuangzhou\n\nHONG\n\nKONG\n\nHigh-speed rail\n\nCities on full or partial lockdown\n\nPopulation density\n\nHigh\n\nCities on full or partial lockdown, population: 30M\n\nHuanggang\n\nDangyang\n\nEzhou\n\n6 million\n\nZhijiang\n\nQianjiang\n\nHuangshi\n\nXiantao\n\nWuhan\n\n11 million\n\nXianning\n\nJingmen\n\nU.S.'s three largest cities, population: 15M\n\nLos Angeles\n\nNew York City\n\n4 million\n\n8 million\n\nChicago\n\n100 miles\n\nCHINA\n\n100 km\n\nBeijing\n\nWuhan\n\nOfficials canceled all outbound trains, ferries, buses and flights and closed down local bus and metro service beginning at 10 a.m. local time on Jan. 23.\n\nShanghai\n\nXiantao\n\nJingmen\n\nHuanggang\n\nDangyang\n\nHuangshi\n\nChengdu\n\nEzhou\n\nZhijiang\n\nXianning\n\nQianjiang\n\nChongqing\n\nGuangzhou\n\nHONG\n\nKONG\n\nHigh-speed rail\n\nCities on full or partial lockdown\n\nPopulation density\n\nHigh\n\nCities on full or partial lockdown, population: 30M\n\nEzhou\n\nDangyang\n\nHuanggang\n\n6 million\n\nQianjiang\n\nZhijiang\n\nHuangshi\n\nXiantao\n\nWuhan\n\n11 million\n\nXianning\n\nJingmen\n\nU.S.'s three largest cities,\n\npopulation: 15M\n\nNew York City\n\nLos\n\nAngeles\n\n8 million\n\n4 million\n\nChicago\n\nNote: 2018 population data.

Those evacuated will be responsible for the cost.\n\nThe U.S. government won approval to conduct such an operation from China's Foreign Ministry and other government agencies following negotiations in recent days, one of these people said. Scheduling issues for the charter may scuttle initial plans to fly on Sunday, but the operation is expected to go ahead, this person said.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Beijing didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. China's Foreign Ministry couldn't immediately be reached for comment on the first day of the country's Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nThe Boeing 767 jet will have U.S. medical personnel aboard to ensure that anyone affected by the newly identified and little-understood coronavirus is cared for and doesn't spread it, one of these people said.\n\nIn addition to U.S. diplomatic officers based in Wuhan, any available seats may be offered to non-U.S. citizens, including diplomats of other nations, this person said, adding that plans are still being formulated and could change. The U.S. plans to temporarily shut its Wuhan consulate, this person added.\n\nIt couldn't be learned exactly when the flight, to be flown by a private charter company, would take place or where in the U.S. the plane would go.\n\nLilly Alice Yuan, a 27-year-old Baltimore resident who is in Wuhan visiting relatives, is among the U.S. citizens hoping to get on a plane out of the locked-down city -- \"the sooner the better,\" said Ms. Yuan, who said she was caught off-guard as the outbreak intensified. \"There are a lot of unknowns,\" she said.\n\nU.S. evacuation operations of this nature have become relatively routine in some parts of the world after natural disasters and political disturbances, but the one being planned now would likely be the first in decades from China. The personsaid U.S. officials considered busing Americans from Wuhan to another city such as Shanghai if a flight couldn't be arranged.\n\nChinese authorities in recent days have halted almost all transit, including commercial flights, in and out of Wuhan as they attempt to cut off the city and much of Hubei province from the rest of the country, in an extraordinary attempt to prevent the virus from spreading further.\n\nThat has left many foreign residents with few options for leaving Wuhan, an important transit hub and manufacturing powerhouse sometimes compared to Chicago or Pittsburgh.\n\nWuhan hosts business operations of a number of major U.S. corporations, including auto maker General Motors Co. It is also home to Chinese state-owned Dongfeng Motor Corp., which is joint venture partners with Japan's Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co., as well as France's Renault SA and PSA Group's Peugeot. Many foreign employees from these companies as well as their suppliers are based in Wuhan.\n\nThe multinational Anheuser-Busch InBev SA brews beer in the city, and We Co.'s WeWork operates co-working spaces there.\n\nOther governments are negotiating with Chinese authorities to arrange flights modeled on China's agreement with the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn addition to the U.S., other countries with consulates in Wuhan include France, the U.K. and South Korea.\n\nFrance, which has several hundred citizens living in Wuhan, said on the website of its China embassy that it is arranging a bus service for citizens in Wuhan who wanted to leave the city. Other European countries are considering similar arrangements, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nSouth Korea is considering chartering a plane for its citizens, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThough Tokyo doesn't have a consulate in Wuhan, the Japanese business community there has asked embassy officials for an evacuation plan, according to another person familiar with the matter.\n\nAt least three Southeast Asian nations are also mulling an evacuation of their citizens, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nOne reason U.S. diplomats were keen to organize such an operation was a concern that anyone suspected of coming down with the illness could find themselves in a quarantine of indefinite length, likely with no access to consular assistance, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Many foreigners who live in China use Western doctors at private clinics instead of the country's government-run hospitals, but their services may not be available during the outbreak.\n\nPermission for the American evacuation operation might have hinged on the U.S. government's pledge to its Chinese counterpart that responsibility for the risks of flying out potentially infected people would be borne by the U.S., this person said.\n\nPassengers will be asked to sign a promissory note for the cost of the flight, which is expected to be many times the price of a commercial flight from China to the U.S., this person said.\n\nAmerican citizens can choose to stay, but the charter flight ensures that \"Americans who want out can leave,\" this person said.\n\nThe State Department relies in large part on American citizens abroad joining its Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, or STEP -- a program that is being used for the Wuhan evacuation plans.\n\nThe State Department this week ordered the departure of all non-emergency U.S. personnel and their family members from the Wuhan area and posted an alert on its website advising against travel to Hubei province on Thursday, the same day that Wuhan municipal authorities announced the citywide lockdown.\n\n\"The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Hubei province,\" read the advisory.\n\nRelated\n\nChina's Vast Ambition in Medicine Gets Reality Check From Coronavirus Relatives Wonder Why Pneumonia Deaths Not in Coronavirus Tally Doctor at Wuhan Hospital Dies as Coronavirus Outbreak Spreads\n\n-- Chun Han Wong, Caitlin Ostroff, Yoko Kubota and Jonathan Cheng contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to James T.

A spokeswoman for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH, confirmed it was working with Moderna to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus strain.\n\nModerna, which is developing genetic treatments that seek to instruct a patient's own cells to produce disease-fighting proteins, went public on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2018 in one of that year's most closely watched biotech initial public offerings.\n\nDespite Wednesday's jump, the company's shares are still trading below their IPO price of $23. A spokeswoman for Moderna declined to comment.\n\nFederal and state health officials said Tuesday that a man in Washington state was the first confirmed U.S. case of the new coronavirus outbreak. The virus, which is believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has sickened hundreds of people in China and has been linked to more than a dozen deaths.\n\nModerna wasn't the only biotech stock facing volatility this week as investors have speculated on which firms might profit from the outbreak.\n\nNanoViricides Inc., which works on nanotechnology-based antiviral treatments, sank 55% to $3.82 a share on Wednesday, while vaccine developer Novavax Inc. fell 28% to $7.09 a share.\n\nThat reversed gains in the stocks on Tuesday, when NanoViricides rallied 153% and Novavax surged 71% on news of the widening outbreak.\n\nNanoViricides President and Chairman Anil Diwan declined to comment on moves in the company's stock price, but he said in an email to The Wall Street Journal that his company had previously developed agents that were worth testing against the Wuhan virus. Novavax is working on a vaccine candidate to respond to the outbreak, a spokeswoman for the company said in a statement.\n\nBoth companies are relatively small compared with Moderna, and both have seen better times. Shares of Shelton, Conn.-based NanoViricides have lost 98% of their value from their peak of $245 in 2006, while shares of Gaithersburg, Md.-based Novavax have lost nearly as much from their high of $300.60 in 2001.\n\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

of Homes for Sale Is at a Record Low", "body": "U.S. home sales picked up in December. Photo: David Crane/Zuma Press By Jeffrey Sparshott Jeffrey Sparshott The Wall Street Journal BiographyJeffrey Sparshott @jeffsparshott Jeffrey.Sparshott@wsj.com Jan 23, 2020 6:40 am ET\n\nThis is the web version of the WSJ's newsletter on the economy. You can sign up for daily delivery here.\n\nBuild Me Up Buttercup\n\nU.S. home sales hit their high mark for the year in December, a sign that favorable mortgage rates and low unemployment are starting to lure more house hunters back into the market. After a slow start, the second half of 2019 showed a pickup in activity that brought total sales of previously owned homes to 5.34 million for the year, the same pace as in 2018. That is giving the housing market fresh momentum going into 2020, especially with the economy continuing to grow and borrowing rates remaining attractive, Will Parker and Sarah Chaney report.\n\nThe catch: There aren't enough homes on the market. The inventory of existing homes for sale last month fell to the lowest level in records dating back to 1982, a potential stumbling block for homebuyers and catalyst for accelerating price gains. \"Low inventory remains a problem, with first-time buyers affected the most,\" said National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun. There are, however, some encouraging signs that home building is picking up. Housing starts hit a 13-year high in December.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH TODAY\n\nThe World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, runs from Jan. 21-24. You can follow the WSJ's coverage here.\n\nThe European Central Bank releases a policy statement at 7:45 a.m. ET, and ECB President Christine Lagarde holds a press conference at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nU.S. jobless claims are expected to rise to 215,000 from 204,000 a week earlier. (8:30 a.m. ET)\n\nThe Conference Board's leading economic index for December is expected to fall 0.2% from the prior month. (10 a.m. ET)\n\nThe Kansas City Fed's manufacturing survey for January is out at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nJapan's consumer-price index for December is out at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nEurope Girds for Battle\n\nEuropean politicians said they would retaliate against any American tariffs after President Trump set his sights on the continent as the next front in his global fight over trade. With a first-phase China deal in his pocket, Mr. Trump said he wants to reach an agreement with the European Union before the U.S. presidential election, and threatened to levy tariffs if talks failed. France's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire quickly shot back: \"If we were to be hit by American tariffs, we would have no choice but to retaliate.\" One way Europe is less vulnerable to U.S. levies than China: The U.S. exports three times more to the EU than it does to China, giving Europe plenty of targets, Stephen Fidler and Greg Ip report.\n\nResetting the Clock\n\nThe \"phase one\" China-U.S. trade deal may turn out to be a watershed -- the most forceful effort yet by the U.S. to reset the engagement clock and correct the flaws of China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001. There are two plausible outcomes following the deal. The optimistic case is that China finally changes in the way American officials had hoped when it joined the WTO and takes a more Western-style approach to the economy and markets. The pessimistic case is that the integration of the Chinese and U.S. economies that followed accession comes undone, Greg Ip writes.\n\nNext up: The U.S. is preparing for a longer and broader campaign to banish China's Huawei Technologies from next-generation 5G cellular networks around the world amid pushback from allies. The Trump administration sees Britain and Germany as bellwethers that could prompt other nations to welcome Huawei, a giant maker of cellular equipment that the U.S. considers a spying threat, Stu Woo reports.\n\nLabour of Love\n\nThe share of American workers in labor unions fell to a fresh record low last year. The fall in union membership reflects both the declining power of organized labor in the U.S. and slower employment growth in traditionally more unionized industries, such as manufacturing, transportation and utilities, compared with health care and other services. Economists point to the decline as a reason why wage growth has been relatively soft in recent years despite low unemployment and steady hiring. Median weekly pay for full-time union members was $1,095 last year versus $892 for nonmembers, Eric Morath reports.\n\nLockdown\n\nGlobal stocks slumped Thursday as China grappled with a worsening viral outbreak, leading investors to reassess the potential economic fallout. The Chinese government on Thursday locked down Wuhan, where the new coronavirus originated, and two other cities in a dramatic escalation of efforts to contain the outbreak that has killed at least 17 people and infected more than 500 so far. Heard on the Street's Nathaniel Taplin writes that the latest outbreak could hit China's economy harder than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -- a similar virus that ultimately killed more than 700 people in the early 2000s. Why? China's transport infrastructure -- particularly high-speed rail -- is far better than it was during the 2003 SARS epidemic, so the virus appears to be spreading quickly. China's economy is also far more dependent on services and consumer spending than in the early 2000s. China's economy is therefore more exposed now than when SARS hit.\n\nWHAT ELSE WE'RE READING\n\nBuild more housing. \"The case for increasing construction becomes more solid by the day. A new paper by economists Brian Asquith, Evan Mast and Davin Reed finds that building one large new market-rate apartment building in a low-income, gentrifying urban neighborhood tends to reduce rents within a 250-meter (800 feet) radius by 5% to 7%. This stands in sharp contrast to the theory that building new apartment buildings raises nearby rents by drawing high-income residents to the area.
