By Robert B. Zoellick March 18, 2020 1:13 pm ET\n\nWhy would the U.S. increase the cost and difficulty of supplying protective gear to doctors and nurses? Why would Washington obstruct the acquisition of lifesaving equipment? Because the sclerosis of trade protectionism, once it takes hold, constricts economic health and adaptation.\n\nChad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculates that the Trump administration has imposed new taxes on almost $5 billion of medical exports from China, totaling about 26% of U.S. health-care imports. With tariffs, the U.S. government is making it harder for first responders to procure masks, sterile gloves, goggles, hospital gowns, surgical drapes, thermometers and breathing masks. America also imports about $22 billion of medical technology from countries all over the world, including CT systems, patient monitors and X-ray devices.\n\nU.S. medical distributors are busy hunting for alternative producers and testing their equipment for interoperability when they should be concentrating on getting supplies to those in need. China, in turn, has diverted its sales to other markets. After President Trump hit Chinese medical suppliers with a 25% tariff in 2018, China's exports to the U.S. dropped by 16%. In some cases, American users had no good alternatives because suppliers must get certified by the Food and Drug Administration, which can take more than two years. U.S. medical-equipment producers have also been plagued by the president's new tariffs on imported components.\n\nMexico ranks second to China in supplying protective medical equipment to the U.S. But Mr. Trump's erratic threats have helped undermine confidence in building that country's industries for export.\n\nThe administration recently offered an indictment of its own economic isolationism. It quietly -- and only temporarily -- reduced tariffs on a smattering of Chinese medical products. Such half-measures fall far short. If Chinese exporters face multiple demands, they will prioritize countries without tariffs or time-limited tariff suspensions.\n\nTwo researchers at the World Bank, Aaditya Mattoo and Michele Ruta, have identified another trade problem the U.S. has overlooked. By March 11, two dozen economies had restricted exports of medical supplies, including Germany, France, South Korea and Taiwan. Mr. Trump's misstatement about shutting down trade with Europe caused anxiety among U.S. providers because the European Union is now the primary foreign supplier of America's CT systems, hand sanitizer, patient monitors and pulse oximeters, X-ray machines and breathing masks. A mere seven countries account for 70% of the exports of artificial respirators, vital tools for the seriously ill; if one of them banned exports, prices could increase by up to 10%.\n\nThere's a lesson in the world-wide surge of food prices from 2008-11 -- overlooked in nearly every retrospective analysis of the financial crisis. As president of the World Bank at that time, I worked with the World Trade Organization to limit restrictions on agricultural exports. Nevertheless, recent World Bank research shows that export limits pushed up global food prices by an average of 13% over that period, and 45% for rice.\n\nCrises cry out for international leadership. In the postwar era, American officials reconciled global good sense with U.S. self-interest. The Trump administration should eliminate all U.S. tariffs on medical products to reduce the cost of the pandemic response, and it should urge other countries to do the same. Forty-six developing economies impose tariffs of 5% to 25% on respirators. The U.S. should rally partners in the Group of 20 to ban restrictions on exports of medical products related to Covid-19 so that the world avoids price spikes, prevents panics, gains benefits of scale and specialized production, preserves variety of sourcing -- and saves lives.\n\nIn addition to coping with a pandemic, Americans face a new debate about the country's role in the world. Some are using the pandemic to argue for greater isolation. That counsel of retreat failed miserably to counter the Great Depression in the 1930s and the security threats of 1941. As recently as the 2008 crisis, Americans learned again that they couldn't wall themselves off from the world.\n\nThe U.S. will need to diversify sources of key supplies, and companies will need to build supply chains that are more flexible and resilient. Nations and businesses should consider prudent inventories and stockpiles. But precautions shouldn't degrade into costly, self-defeating illusions of autarky. Export bans and tariffs on medical goods increase costs, create shortages and make Americans less safe. If other countries embrace these sorts of trade restrictions, major U.S. exporters, including farmers, will be devastated.\n\nModern challenges -- viruses, economic disruptions, the environment, cybersecurity, food supplies and more -- require economic powers to act in concert, even as they pursue their own national interests. Last year the Health Industry Distributors Association warned presciently that Mr. Trump's medical tariffs \"put a risk to our nation's public health preparedness.\" Americans are now paying the price for the president's failure to recognize that his trade wars and walls would backfire.\n\nMr. Zoellick is a former World Bank president, U.S. trade representative and deputy secretary of state.\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Data released last week by the National Health Institute in Italy, currently the world's worst-hit country, shows mortality rates starting at 0% for patients aged 0 to 29 and edging up to peak at 19% for those over 90.\n\nYet scientists say tests have shown children and young adults are no less likely than older people to get infected and transmit the virus. Epidemiologists are growing concerned that the millennial pushback against social-distancing measures -- and an emerging generational divide about how the disease is perceived -- could undo all efforts to slow the spread of the virus and put vulnerable people at high risk.\n\nPresident Trump on Monday stressed that young people can spread the virus even if they only have mild symptoms and recommended that Americans avoid restaurants and gatherings of more than 10 people. French President Emmanuel Macron went further, announcing a nationwide lockdown and punishment for those who violate the rules.\n\nSo far, the young don't seem to be listening.\n\nAfter social media became filled with reports of packed bars and restaurants in New York, 30-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) tweeted to her millions of followers on Saturday.\n\n\"To everyone in NYC but ESPECIALLY healthy people & people under 40, (bc from what I'm observing that's who needs to hear this again), PLEASE stop crowding bars, restaurants, and public spaces right now. Eat your meals at home.\"\n\nAfter Princeton University said last week it would move classroom instruction on-line on March 19 and send most of its students home, the campus saw an explosion in gatherings and parties, according to students and staff.\n\n\"People were not ready to give up their lifestyle without one last hurrah,\" said Ben Weissenbach, a Princeton undergraduate English major who was critical of some of the partying. \"At a really privileged place like Princeton, we don't tend to even consider the possibility that our bubble could be popped.\"\n\nIn an email to all students on Friday, the university announced stricter measures and penalties for offenders, saying \"we are disheartened to see that so many students are failing to heed these protective measures and engaging in disruptive behavior.\"\n\nIn a display of juvenile gallows humor, the hashtag #BoomerRemover, a nickname for the novel coronavirus, briefly trended on Twitter last weekend.\n\nAcross Europe, where social life is shutting down faster than in the U.S., a divide is spreading between the young, many of whom say they don't fear the virus, and their elders, including politicians and scientists, whose alarm about the illness is growing by the day.\n\nIn Berlin, a European clubbing hot spot, authorities ordered the closure of all bars and clubs on Saturday. Yet many establishments ignored the decree, forcing police to forcibly shut down some 63 establishments across the city.\n\nThat night, the Ernst basement bar in the trendy district of Kreuzberg was packed with patrons enjoying loud electronica. \"Beware: Coronavirus\" was sprayed on a bench near the entrance.\n\nInside the stylish Wagemut cocktail bar, a young woman pretended to sneeze in someone's face, unleashing thunderous laughter.\n\nOn Sunday, Berlin health officials said 42 people were thought to have infected themselves in Berlin clubs. Some of those were club-hopping, spreading the virus as they went.\n\n\"This is the attitude of people who are part of this nightlife,\" said Lutz Leichsenring, a director of the association of Berlin club owners. \"So what? You get the flu, you're not going to die.\"\n\nLast week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel herself, in her first press conference on the epidemic, urged young people to respect the new social restrictions for their grandparents' sake.\n\nDespite the pointed fingers and occasional excesses, many young people bristle at the accusation of selfishness, saying the new social constraints are disproportionate and unfairly target their generation.\n\n\"They're preventing us from living,\" said Timoth\u00e9e Thierry, a 30-year-old statistician at France's health ministry. He spoke on Sunday, after the government shut down bars but before it locked down the entire country.\n\nIn Italy, which has been on lockdown for days, young people, especially students, face a choice between returning to their parents' homes or remaining cooped up in small apartments, desperate for a social outlet.\n\nOne student in the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy said she sneaked out of her apartment to attend a dinner party because she was feeling depressed from days of isolation. The party was only a 10-minute walk away. Once there she joined four other people, drinking wine and eating around the dinner table.\n\nJust before midnight, the police knocked on the door and asked for the identification cards and phone numbers of everyone in the group. They ordered the revelers to return home, warning them that their information was being kept on file. Each person was subject to a hefty fine or jail-time for attending the party, the police said, according to the student.\n\nSome say they are less frustrated by the prospect of extreme confinement than they are doubtful it could ever work in the West, which prizes individualism and freedom.\n\n\"If I get sick, I will spend some days at home to avoid spreading it to others,\" said Monica Rubio, 19, who was having a late breakfast with three friends late last week in Barcelona, Spain, one of Europe's most heavily affected countries.\n\n\"Otherwise I won't change my life because of it. I can't imagine people would stop shaking hands, kissing or hugging. It is deeply entrenched in our society.\"\n\nIn Asia, there have been fewer complaints from authorities about younger people flouting social-distancing rules, but with the epicenter of the pandemic now shifting to Europe, the sense of urgency, palpable at the peak of the Chinese epidemic, has begun to recede in the East.\n\nMong Kok, a busy shopping hub in Hong Kong's Kowloon district, has been noticeably busier than in previous weeks, with many young people tentatively returning to their pre-coronavirus weekend routines. Despite the greater crowds, many youthful bystanders still wear surgical masks and keep hand sanitizer close to hand, even attached to rucksacks.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nWhat should localities do to keep socially active teens and young adults from spreading the virus? Join the conversation below.\n\n\"I think it's quite boring staying inside. Teens and young people you see, they're stuck at home and out of the office. It's quite hard,\" said Hailey Cheng, 27, as a street performer tried to fire up a lackluster audience nearby.\n\nOn a recent night in the semiautonomous city, Peel Street, a thoroughfare lined with bars and popular with expats, thronged with hundreds of maskless drinkers. A band played in the lower half of the street, where people stood shoulder to shoulder.\n\n\"I stayed at home for two months. I'm not staying any more,\" said Ryan, 26, who was walking with his friends down the main strip of nearby Lan Kwai Fong, a series of streets filled with bars and clubs. \"Life goes on.\"\n\n\"We worry,\" said Nicole, 25. \"But either you worry yourself to death or you drink yourself to death.\"\n\n-- William Boston and Mike Bird contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Bojan Pancevski at bojan.pancevski@wsj.com and Stacy Meichtry at stacy.meichtry@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

As anxious consumers stockpile goods, grocers have turned to rationing, imposing purchase limits on disinfectant wipes, cleaning supplies and other high-demand products.\n\nThe move is the first time the FMCSA has issued nationwide-wide relief from hours-of-service regulations, although regional declarations have waived those rules in response to disasters such as hurricanes.\n\nFederal regulations limit most commercial truck drivers to 11 hours of driving time in a 14-hour workday, restrictions intended to reduce accidents caused by highway fatigue.\n\nThe national emergency declaration applies to carriers providing direct assistance to relief efforts tied to the coronavirus pandemic, such as moving medical supplies and equipment to test, diagnose and treat Covid-19. It also applies to those hauling goods to help prevent its spread, including masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfectants.\n\nDrivers transporting \"food for emergency restocking of stores\" are also covered by the declaration.\n\nIt also applies to motor carriers moving medical and emergency services providers, people needed to set up and manage temporary housing and quarantine facilities, and people being moved for medical, isolation or quarantine purposes, the agency said.\n\nThe declaration doesn't apply to routine commercial deliveries or truckers hauling mixed loads that include essential supplies. Drivers that inform motor carriers they need immediate rest must be permitted at least 10 consecutive hours off duty.\n\nCoronavirus Free to Read\n\nLive Updates\n\nWhat We Know\n\nYou Ask, We Answer\n\nWhat's Open?\n\nHow to Navigate the Crisis\n\nArtboard 1\n\nVideo Updates\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

He didn't have to remind himself to breathe in fresh air. He couldn't wait.\n\n\"Not only was it every day, but there was almost nothing that could stop us,\" said Mike Goldrich, the NIAID's former chief operating officer who also happened to be Fauci's running buddy. \"Ice. Snow. Rain. Heat. We were big fans of Gore-Tex.\"\n\nNow there is something that's slowing him down. The greatest challenge of Fauci's distinguished career is now so demanding that he can't pause in his 20-hour workdays to run at lunch. It took a pandemic for this 79-year-old workaholic to resign himself to walking several miles on weekends.\n\nIt's not that running itself is unsafe right now. The nation's public health officials have reassured the public that running alone outside remains safe, healthy and perfectly acceptable at a time of social distancing. Even for Tony Fauci. Especially for Tony Fauci.\n\n\"I support any healthy activity that helps Dr. Fauci to find the strength, resolve, and calm that he needs to do the job he does,\" said Joshua Sharfstein, a vice dean at Johns Hopkins' public health school.\n\nFauci refers to himself as a power walker these days. But he used to be a marathoner. His personal record was 3:37 in the 1984 Marine Corps Marathon, and he completed New York in 4:07 the next year and another Marine Corps in 3:52 in 1990. And he was always a lunchtime jogger.\n\n\"I think the benefit for me is a stress reliever -- because I have a pretty high-stress job, Fauci told the National Institute on Aging in 2016. \"Getting outside in the day and hearing the birds and smelling the grass is kind of a very pleasing thing for me.\"\n\nEven at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Fauci was fastidious about his noontime run. He powered through five miles at roughly eight minutes per mile, and he even stuck to the same route: left from Building 31 on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Md., across Rockville Pike and into Rock Creek Park.\n\nHis runs were a convenient way for Fauci to squeeze more work into his lunch break. \"It was a means to do business,\" Goldrich said. They made it their habit to meet first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Their run was essentially another meeting in the middle of the day.\n\nIt was a meeting far from the halls of Congress, the White House or the Department of Health and Human Services, the entities in downtown Washington, D.C. that controlled NIH's funding, priorities and research. Runners from those buildings typically take to Capitol Hill or the National Mall. They didn't get to run with Fauci.\n\nFauci's admirers rave about his work ethic and leadership. But there is one compliment that only someone who knows him as intimately as his running buddy would offer.\n\n\"He had the best knees of anybody I knew at our age,\" Goldrich said.\n\nFauci, a youth basketball, football and baseball player who was the diminutive captain of his high school's basketball team, says that other parts of his body haven't fared as well.\n\n\"When I run and pound, it sort of hurts my back,\" he said on the Pardon My Take podcast this week. \"So I walk that distance. It takes a little longer.\"\n\nDr. Vincent DeVita, a professor at Yale and the former director of the National Cancer Institute, was a longtime colleague. DeVita was a runner, too, until his knees made him an ex-runner. Those runs were crucial to his productivity. He used his time in sneakers to clear his mind and contemplate the road ahead.\n\n\"I'm sure Tony is doing the same,\" he said, \"trying to think about what he should say to the American people and the president.\"\n\nThere were lots of scientists and doctors at the NIH in those days who were lunchtime runners. They even had a name for themselves: the Health's Angels Running Club.\n\nIn the 1970s, they would meet by the NIH clinical hospital and head to Rock Creek Park, the best loop in the city for biking, rollerblading and especially running. The people in Health's Angels were serious runners. And they had to have a serious conversation with Fauci.\n\n\"Tony, if you're going to run with us, you're going to need to pick up the pace,\" one of the Health's Angels told him in the locker room. \"Otherwise we're going to leave you in the dust.\"\n\nBut smart pacing is Fauci's specialty. An immunologist who became the nation's point man on infectious diseases, Fauci has served under six U.S. presidents, leading the NIAID since 1984 and earning the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2008. He's seen every problem in public health over several decades. He met, sparred and worked with the same HIV activists who at one point staged a demonstration outside Building 31. He bolstered the country's biodefense after the Sept. 11 attacks. He spearheaded the agency's response to Ebola under Barack Obama. And he kept running.\n\nThe legend of Fauci went something like this: He woke before dawn, arrived at his office around 6:30 a.m. and protected time in his day to run at noon. \"Or as close to noon as we could make it,\" Goldrich said. Their daily routine -- change, run, shower -- would take an hour. They ate back at their desks afterward. \"I remember everyone being worried about being as thin as we were,\" Goldrich said. \"On the other hand, if you run every day for five miles, you can basically eat a cow.\"\n\nFauci had ditched the Health's Angels by then to run with a partner instead of the pack, and he spent his lunch break talking with Goldrich about work. But there was one exception: Fauci liked to predict when they would see birds in the spring.\n\n\"He came pretty close to when that first robin would come out,\" Goldrich said.\n\nEven though Fauci has said that he's not running during this particular crisis, Goldrich says he suspects he's sneaking in some exercise at \"ungodly hours,\" while others who worked closely with him find themselves oddly uplifted that all those hours of exercise have kept him in shape for perhaps the battle of his life.\n\n\"I'm comforted that Tony is there,\" DeVita said, \"and fit and functional.\"\n\nWrite to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Government Failed.", "body": "\u00a9 chandan khanna/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nWhen cases of the new coronavirus began emerging several weeks ago in California, Washington state and other pockets of the country, U.S. public-health officials worried this might be The Big One, emails and interviews show.\n\nThe testing program they rolled out to combat it, though, was a small one.\n\nLimited testing has blinded Americans to the scale of the outbreak so far, impeding the nation's ability to fight the virus through isolating the sick and their contacts, public-health officials say. As of early Wednesday, about 6,500 people in the U.S. had tested positive, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University show, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported only about 32,000 tests conducted at its facilities and other public-health labs.\n\nLimited testing is also keeping patients like Justin LaBor in the dark, despite recent improvements. Mr. LaBor, 36 years old, said he went to the emergency room at AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Pomona, N.J., Monday with a fever and dry cough, symptoms typical in a coronavirus infection. Doctors admitted him, but he hasn't been tested for the virus, he said Tuesday, gasping for breath over the phone.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\n\"Everyone just told me there were no tests and I didn't check all the boxes for the state,\" said Mr. LaBor, a social-media marketer from Elwood, N.J., referring to the criteria that state labs require patients to meet before running tests. A New Jersey health-department spokeswoman said the state \"has sufficient lab capacity to test those who meet the testing criteria.\" An AtlantiCare spokeswoman said the hospital system \"is not testing patients in a widespread manner for coronavirus.\"\n\nWhile the virus was quietly spreading within the U.S., the CDC had told state and local officials its \"testing capacity is more than adequate to meet current testing demands,\" according to a Feb. 26 agency email viewed by The Wall Street Journal, part of a cache of agency communications reviewed by the Journal that sheds light on the early response. The agency's data show it tested fewer than 100 patients that day.\n\nWhen the CDC first dispersed test kits in early February, it shipped them to a network of state and local government labs and restricted testing to people with virus symptoms who had recently traveled to China, where the virus first emerged, or had been exposed to a known case. Federal officials hoped the virus could be contained -- even as they disputed alarms from those on the front lines that the CDC's guidelines weren't keeping up with the outbreak's spread, emails between the U.S. agency and local officials show. The government left other laboratories on the sidelines for crucial weeks.\n\nThe narrow effort is \"a failing,\" said Anthony Fauci , a government doctor who has become the de facto face of the Trump administration's coronavirus response, in congressional testimony last week that for many in Washington was a wake-up call.\n\nWhile problems still clearly persist, more labs are beginning to do tests and manufacturers are ramping up production. \"We can expect to see a marked acceleration of the availability and implementation of testing,\" Dr. Fauci said in an interview Friday.\n\nCDC officials botched an initial test kit developed in an agency lab, retracting many tests. They resisted calls from state officials and medical providers to broaden testing, and health officials failed to coordinate with outside companies to ensure needed test-kit supplies, such as nasal swabs and chemical reagents, would be available, according to suppliers and health officials.\n\nWhen the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also involved in the response, finally opened testing to more outside labs, a run on limited stocks of some supplies needed for the CDC-developed test quickly depleted stores, lab operators and suppliers said. Hospital and commercial lab operators said the government didn't reach out to enlist their help until it was too late.\n\n\"This was kind of a perfect storm of three separate failures,\" said Tom Frieden, who directed the CDC from 2009 to 2017, citing the botched test, overstrict FDA rules and sidelined private labs. He cautioned he didn't have direct knowledge of details.\n\nNow, the U.S. is testing far fewer patients than public-health and infectious-disease experts say is necessary and just a fraction as many as other countries that rolled out wide-reaching diagnostic programs. South Korea as of Tuesday was testing up to 20,000 patients a day, more than half the total of U.S. patients who have been tested since the outbreak began.\n\nThe test shortage hurt U.S. efforts to contain the virus, said Neil Fishman, chief medical officer at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and an infectious-disease specialist.\n\nNews to stay informed. Advice to stay safe.\n\nClick here for complete coronavirus coverage from Microsoft News\n\n\"If we would have had a true understanding of the extent of disease several weeks ago, implementation of social-distancing measures could have prevented the escalation of the disease,\" Dr. Fishman said, and demand for the test is now huge.\n\nHealth-care officials say the current state of testing reflects both technical and planning failures, as well as a broader failure of imagination. Leaders including President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar early in the outbreak appeared unable or unwilling to envision a crisis of the scale that has now emerged, and no one stepped up to effectively coordinate among federal agencies or the private-sector labs, medical providers and manufacturers needed for a large-scale testing push, they say.\n\nAn HHS spokeswoman said Brett Giroir, a deputy Mr. Azar put in charge of testing last week, would assume that role. She said the FDA began working with private test developers in January by sharing information about the process for approving tests.\n\nThe CDC said in an email to the Journal on Monday that its work with public-health labs is meant to fill \"the short-term gap until experienced commercial diagnostic manufacturers come to market.\"\n\nMr. Trump repeatedly dismissed the threat of a broad U.S. outbreak, saying in late February, \"One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear.\" The next day, the first reported American death tied to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, occurred in Washington state.\n\nSome White House aides learned of complaints about the availability of testing from the media, not the public-health officials in their own government, an administration official familiar with the matter said. Only in the first week of March did discussions in a White House coronavirus task force about the testing shortfall take on a sense of urgency, the person said.\n\nEven then, Mr. Azar, defended the testing program in television interviews including twice on ABC News that week, citing the low number of confirmed cases -- at a time when almost no tests were available to detect them.\n\nThe White House didn't respond to requests for comment. The HHS spokeswoman said health officials are focused on efforts to increase test accessibility and pointed to a series of recent statements on the topic.\n\nAt the CDC, the tone was more dire. \"While leaning forward aggressively with the hope that we will be able to prevent community spread, we also are preparing for the worst,\" the agency told state public-health officials in a Feb. 20 email.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office had warned federal officials in early January that its readiness for something like a pandemic fell short, a GAO official said. GAO investigators found crisis plans didn't fully account for the huge role the private sector would have to play, documents show.\n\nThe HHS spokeswoman said the agency's coronavirus response was guided by other \"well-practiced\" operational plans, and not the strategic one the GAO reviewed. An HHS official told the GAO, in a letter dated Jan. 31, that the agency had addressed their concerns and put in place policies that would \"prevent early implementation challenges from becoming institutionalized.\"\n\nIn the weeks ahead, however, those very challenges did become institutionalized. The FDA first announced labs seeking to perform testing would have to submit a special application to get permission to start on Feb. 4. That initially deterred some hospitals and other lab operators -- which normally aren't required to submit any application -- from developing tests, experts say.\n\n\"We had considered developing a test but had been in communication with the CDC and FDA and had been told that the federal and state authorities would be able to handle everything,\" Alan Wells, the medical director for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's clinical laboratories, told reporters over the weekend. He said in an interview on Monday that it later became clear the CDC and states were overwhelmed.\n\nOnce the CDC launched its initial test in the first week of February, the response was quickly stymied by setbacks, including flaws that forced the CDC to claw back many of the kits it had already sent out to state public-health laboratories, according to the agency and public-health officials.\n\nAn email to state public-health-lab officials later in February gives the fullest account from the CDC to emerge yet of what happened: The agency said some labs had encountered \"sporadic reactivity in the negative control of one of the three assay components.\" That means the test in some cases wrongly indicated it had detected coronavirus in samples of laboratory-grade water.\n\n\"It is unclear why quality control did not detect this issue before the kits were sent out to states,\" said the email.\n\nThe CDC on Monday said it \"has not yet determined if the problem involves the assay design or contamination. It could have been either.\"\n\nAt one critical juncture, just before the CDC opened up testing to more state laboratories in February, its officials clashed with state epidemiologists on the front lines of the response to the epidemic over the scale of testing.\n\nDespite news and official reports heralding the rapid spread of the virus in Japan and Hong Kong, on Feb. 22 CDC officials told state officials to refer for testing only patients showing symptoms who had travel histories in mainland China.\n\nWhen a top Minnesota epidemiologist pointed out in an email to CDC officials that agency director Robert Redfield had recently tweeted that doctors treating patients who had visited Hong Kong and Japan should consider \"#COVID19,\" the CDC's deputy incident commander responded: \"This tweet is being taken down.\" And, in fact, it was.\n\nThe CDC hasn't responded to requests for comment on why the tweet was deleted.\n\nHawaii's top epidemiologist, Sarah Park, chimed in on the thread, saying the bar for testing should be lowered. Dr. Park pointed out that the CDC's own travel website said travelers from Japan with symptoms should be considered for coronavirus even though the guidelines precluded testing.\n\nRather than expand testing, the CDC replied that it was considering changes to its travel notices.\n\nThe epidemiologists, too, recognized the current testing program wouldn't meet the widening need. As they debated expanding testing to more people, Marcelle Layton, a top official with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, expressed the worry that too many returning travelers would expect to be screened as the list of affected countries expanded.\n\n\"We all know this is not sustainable,\" Dr. Layton said in a Feb. 25 email to other public-health officials. She and Dr. Park didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs the CDC sought to get the network of state labs up and running, it finally turned to an outside manufacturer, Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., to order a run of custom reagents -- substances used in a chemical reaction -- needed to identify the genetic imprint of coronavirus in late February, according to the company and a timeline provided by the CDC. IDT said in a statement that it shipped the CDC's first order on Feb. 26.\n\nThe CDC said it signed a contract with IDT to supply reagents on Feb. 20. Contracting records show one IDT order from that day, for only about $90,000 of testing supplies. The CDC said that contract was for coronavirus-test material. IDT denied that contract was related to the coronavirus tests.\n\nWith IDT creating special coronavirus test kits, the federal government abruptly began to make moves that would open the door to more and broader testing, including expanding its criteria for whom to test. On Feb. 26, Nancy Messonnier, a top CDC official, promised in a call with reporters that commercial labs would \"be coming online soon,\" and a couple of days later, the FDA allowed some labs seeking to use the CDC's testing method or developing their own to jump through fewer hoops.\n\nIDT would produce millions of tests worth of its coronavirus-detecting reagent over the next couple of weeks, according to the company's statement.\n\nEven still, the wave of private labs joining the fight against the virus didn't arrive on schedule. One reason was that many of the off-the-shelf supplies used in the CDC's testing method weren't readily available on the scale needed, the Journal found. That included both the simple products like synthetic swabs -- cotton interferes with readings -- used to collect mucus samples, and complex ones. Because labs copying the CDC's test method have to use its exact chemical recipe, there has been a run on manufacturer Qiagen NV's reagent for separating viral RNA from human mucus, one of the products used by the agency.\n\n\"We have heard concerns from labs who have questions about the availability of certain supplies,\" said the HHS spokeswoman. The agency was providing labs with \"information on alternative sources of reagents, extraction kits, swabs and more,\" she said.\n\n\"Everyone in the world is going to want to get swabbed at one point or another,\" said Iyda Antony a lab director at UC Davis Health, a large California health system that is ramping up its own testing program and worries its stores of swabs might not be sufficient.\n\nA small lab owned by lab-manager Clinical Lab Consulting, in Dayton, Ohio, paid $2 per unit -- six times its usual rate -- for swabs from a Pittsburgh-based vendor on Sunday, email records show. On Tuesday, the vendor told the lab's owners it was actually out of stock.\n\nThe U.S. government \"could have just got out in front of it,\" said Greg Ingle, one of the Dayton lab's owners and an industry consultant. Rather, \"we watched it play out in the rest of the world before getting into the market.\"\n\nThrough mid-March, Qiagen spokesman Thomas Theuringer said the Dutch biotech has shipped more than twice as many units of the product in question as in the whole of 2019 to U.S. clients.\n\n\"It's like queuing up in line to buy toilet paper at the grocery store,\" said Richard Scanlan, the medical director of the Oregon Health and Sciences University Hospital laboratory, comparing the lab's predicament to the empty shelves consumers are facing around the country. \"Everyone is trying to buy it at the same time,\" he said.\n\nQiagen said it was rationing test kits to its \"most critical customers\" and acknowledged the company was struggling to meet demand. Dr. Theuringer said the factories producing the kits had ramped up to \"three shifts working seven days a week.\"\n\nVirus researcher Scott Weaver, at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, said a group he directs has sent out coronavirus RNA samples needed to do the validation studies to around 50 labs. Nonetheless, he said, some of those labs, including one at his own institution, were delayed as they waited for Qiagen to fill orders in order to begin testing. The Galveston lab is now able to perform tests, he said, but supplies remain limited.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump said in a briefing that, \"in case we need it,\" he would invoke a Korean War-era law called the Defense Production Act that allows the federal government to force U.S. companies to produce needed supplies.\n\nIn recent days, the FDA has tried to confront the testing shortage by approving new test designs by manufacturers such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and testing firms like Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Inc., and relaxing requirements for labs to prove their tests actually work and stick strictly to the CDC recipe. Thermo said Tuesday it has 1.5 million tests ready to ship.\n\nFDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn maintained the agency's insistence on test accuracy has been vital. \"If you don't have that check on the test findings,\" he said, \"you run the risk of inaccurate test results which means you aren't truly assessing the full scope of the outbreak.\"\n\nNow, in a concession to demand, the agency is letting labs run tests first and prove they are accurate later -- within about two weeks.\n\nAfter hearing news reports saying more tests had become available, Nathan Conder, a 30-year-old in Salt Lake City, called Utah's coronavirus hotline Monday to ask about getting tested. He'd been sick with a fever, dry cough and fatigue for a week -- all coronavirus symptoms, although also of other maladies.\n\n\"They told me all my symptoms match, but they don't have enough tests so they're only testing people who were in contact with someone who already tested positive,\" said Mr. Conder, a regulatory specialist at a microbiology lab. Public-health officials said \"that I should act like I had it, but they can't test,\" he recalled.\n\nOn Tuesday, a doctor prescribed a coronavirus test for Mr. Conder after extensive screening and sent him to a nearby hospital lab. From there, he said, he was diverted to a new drive-in testing facility, where workers requested an additional form that took hours to obtain. After an ordeal of nearly six hours in total, he said, he got the test and was told he would get results within three days.\n\nWrite to Christopher Weaver at christopher.weaver@wsj.com, Betsy McKay at betsy.mckay@wsj.com and Brianna Abbott at brianna.abbott@wsj.com\n\nRead More", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "betsy_mckay@wsj.com", "name": "Betsy McKay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "christopher_weaver@wsj.com", "name": "Christopher Weaver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brianna_abbott@wsj.com", "name": "Brianna Abbott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Azar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Azar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Accountability_Office", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government Accountability Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

On Tuesday, Pennsylvania closed its state-run rest stops, cutting back significant parking space along key logistics corridors.\n\nSome customers are asking drivers to stay in their trucks or switch from paper to electronic methods to document pickups and deliveries, trucking companies and freight brokers said. Additionally, some trucking companies said their drivers are facing new restrictions at receiving docks if they have been in states considered coronavirus hot zones.\n\n\"Some of the shippers and receivers are asking drivers to sign affidavits that they are not sick,\" said Linda Allen, owner of Hardcore Trucking, a trucking company based in Spring Hill, Fla., that hauls refrigerated loads.\n\n\"They are not allowed to use the restroom, not allowed to use the building,\" Ms. Allen said. \"They don't want drivers in the facilities.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStranded Trucker Becomes Unlikely Hero of Coronavirus Lockdown\n\nThe American Trucking Associations industry group has asked the Trump administration to exempt truckers delivering essential goods from travel and other restrictions aimed at containing the pandemic.\n\nIn a letter Tuesday, the group also asked for rest stops to be kept open and for guidance on driver health, including possible testing for Covid-19. \"Absent policies like these, it will be more difficult to ensure that the shelves are stocked and emergency supplies reach first responders and medical personnel,\" ATA Chief Executive Chris Spear said in the letter.\n\nTrucking capacity is getting tighter as demand surges from retailers and manufacturers hustling to replenish stores and distribution centers cleaned out by shoppers stockpiling food and sanitizing supplies. On Tuesday, the average rate to hire a truck on the spot market, where businesses book last-minute transportation, had increased 6.1% since Feb. 29 to $1.89 per mile including fuel, according to online freight marketplace DAT Solutions LLC.\n\nShipments of items such as electronics and health and beauty products are being delayed as retailers make more room in distribution centers and stores for food, paper products and diapers, according to Mac Pinkerton, president of freight broker C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc.'s North American Surface Transportation division.\n\n\"Given the amount of foodstuffs and consumables being purchased, it has created a tremendous amount of disruption across those supply chains,\" said Mr. Pinkerton.\n\nMore\n\nChina Shipping Exports Rebound, Just as Western Ports Cope With Coronavirus Downturn March 19, 2020 Commentary: It's Not Premature to Set Supply Chains for a Coronavirus Recovery March 19, 2020 U.S. Suspends Truck-Driving Limits to Speed Coronavirus Shipments March 14, 2020\n\nSome drivers aren't willing to haul loads to states such as New York or Washington where the numbers of coronavirus cases are highest \"because when they go to other states, they are stopped at the gate and asked where they have been,\" said Libby O'Hara, U.S. operations director for Logistics Plus Inc., an Erie, Pa.-based logistics and trucking provider.\n\nPennsylvania is home to large clusters of warehouses and distribution centers, and serves as a major lane for freight moving through the East Coast and the Midwest. News that Pennsylvania was shutting down its state-run rest stops raised alarms among truckers.\n\nThe Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association asked the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the main U.S. regulator of trucking operations, to direct states to ensure truck stops would remain open. \"For professional drivers, rest areas aren't simply places to purchase snacks and beverages from vending machines -- they are invaluable locations to rest when fatigued,\" the group said in a letter Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said it would reopen 13 rest areas by Thursday for truck parking with portable toilets that would be cleaned once a day.\n\nFMCSA recently lifted hourly driving restrictions for truckers hauling critical medical goods and food for emergency restocking of stores in response to the pandemic. On Wednesday, the agency expanded its national emergency declaration to include fuel, paper products and other groceries as well as raw materials such as paper, plastic and alcohol used to manufacture essential items.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nMost major truck-stop chains and many independent truck stops remain open, although some have closed sit-down restaurants and are preparing food for pickup or takeout, said Lisa Mullings, chief executive of NATSO, a trade group for the travel plaza and truck stop industry.\n\nOn Tuesday, FMSCA acting administrator Jim Mullen said in a letter to NATSO that \"in the coming weeks and months, it will be critical that these businesses remain open, 24 hours a day, providing America's truck drivers with fuel, food, showers, repair services and opportunities to rest.\"\n\nTruck-stop chains Pilot Flying J and TravelCenters of America, which operates TA and Petro Stopping Centers, said in online updates that their showers are open and employees are stepping up cleaning and disinfecting restrooms and commonly used areas. Both chains have posted state-by-state updates on changes in dining service.\n\nPilot Flying J said in its update that \"we strongly encourage drivers [to] use social distancing while in our stores.\"\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
