Shaw group, ahead of Thursday's announcement.\n\nThe cash injections don't represent a full-on return to the type of long-term asset purchases, called quantitative easing, that the Fed deployed in successive campaigns during and after the 2008 financial crisis. That is because the Fed is only lending money for one to three months at a time.\n\nA separate move by the Fed marked a much clearer step in that direction.\n\nThe central bank said that beginning Friday it would shift purchases of $60 billion in short-term Treasury bills, which have maturities of one year or less, toward a broader range of maturities that reflect overall issuance by the Treasury Department.\n\nThe Fed didn't say how long those purchases will last, likely kicking that decision to next week's two-day rate-setting meeting. Analysts on Wall Street are increasingly expecting the Fed to cut interest rates to zero. It last week approved an emergency half-point reduction in the benchmark federal-funds rate, to a range between 1% and 1.25%.\n\nAsset managers and investors viewed Thursday's intervention as a first step that quells short-term balance sheet issues that have become acute over the last week as companies tapped credit lines and drew down on revolving loans. But they say it isn't the ultimate fix.\n\n\"The first point of action is the Fed needs to supply liquidity to the banks so they can meet credit drawdowns and relieve initial balance-sheet strain, but it doesn't fix the fundamental problem of consumer spending,\" said Keith DeCarlucci, chief investment officer and founder of hedge fund KEAL Capital.\n\n\"Flights are getting canceled and restaurants are emptying rapidly, which is not fixed by liquidity. Businesses need to be supported through fiscal measures in order to weather the collapse in turnover,\" said Mr. DeCarlucci.\n\nSome investors said the Fed's actions wouldn't be successful until markets had confidence that Washington was taking a more aggressive response to the public-health emergency.\n\n\"The U.S. policy response to the virus has been an utter shambles that is quickly getting even worse,\" said Mark Bathgate, an investment strategist at Tweeddale Advisors in London. As an example, he cited the Trump administration's early efforts to play down the virus before installing a ban on travel from most of Europe after the virus was already spreading in the U.S.\n\nThe Fed's intervention didn't address funding problems in mortgage-bond markets, where trading conditions were little improved after the announcement. On Wednesday, spreads between the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage and the 10-year Treasury widened dramatically because of little demand at any price from buyers of mortgage securities, undoing a large drop in mortgage rates last week.\n\n\"Our market is now completely closed. There is no offer to buy any agency mortgage product of any type,\" said Lou Barnes, a mortgage banker in Boulder, Colo.\n\nThe Fed has been buying $60 billion a month in bills since October, and it has also been reinvesting $20 billion a month in Treasury securities to replace maturing mortgage bonds.\n\nFed officials for months said that their purchases of Treasury bills didn't represent a return to quantitative easing because they are purely technical and concentrated in short-term bonds, which officials believed provided much less stimulus.\n\nStock-market declines are normally accompanied by rising prices and falling yields in Treasury markets as investors switch from risky assets to safe ones. But on Wednesday, both sold off together in a sign that big banks were looking to raise cash and pulling back from their role as middlemen in financial markets.\n\nThe Fed took initial steps earlier this week to boost the volume of lending for overnight repurchase agreement operations, or repo. It had announced plans Wednesday to increase lending to more than $500 billion, from less than $200 billion, before announcing the additional expansion on Thursday.\n\nThe New York Fed conducted an additional $500 billion, three-month offering on Thursday and will offer $1 trillion in short-term funding Friday, split between a three-month and one-month offering. Until Thursday, all of the Fed's recent repo offerings had maturities of two weeks or less.\n\nThe Fed said it would offer another $1 trillion on a weekly basis.\n\nThe total size of the overnight repo market is about $1.3 trillion and the Fed's total asset portfolio stood at $4.2 trillion last week, \"so the Fed has unloaded some real fire power to alleviate one source of strain,\" said Jim Vogel, interest-rate strategist at FHN Financial.\n\nThursday's offering for up to $500 billion in three-month loans resulted in financial institutions taking $78.4 billion, bringing total repo lending from the Fed to $361.5 billion.\n\nA rout has deepened this week on Wall Street because investors are unsure how long or deep any economic downturn from the pandemic will last, forcing a broad rethink of their willingness to own riskier assets such as stocks and corporate bonds.\n\nUntil Wednesday, market selloffs had been sharp but orderly, said investors and analysts. That changed on Wednesday, when the decline in the price of U.S. Treasury securities, which until this week had consistently risen significantly on days when U.S. stocks were falling, offered a sign of potential stresses in market functioning.\n\nThe price declines sent yields higher and were fueled in part by banks selling government securities to reduce inventories and raise cash.\n\nAnother area of worry has been certain trades by hedge funds that have faced large losses in recent days as prices rise on the spread between a Treasury bond and the equivalent future, known as the \"cash-future basis.\" Analysts and portfolio managers scrutinize the basis because signs of stress there can foretell lending pullbacks.\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com and Julia-Ambra Verlaine at Julia.Verlaine@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

move comes as hospitals report shortages and retailers and manufacturers strain under surging demand By Jennifer Smith Jennifer Smith The Wall Street Journal BiographyJennifer Smith @jensmithWSJ Jennifer.Smith@wsj.com March 14, 2020 11:34 am ET\n\nU.S. highway-safety regulators are suspending rules that limit daily driving hours for truck drivers moving emergency supplies such as medical equipment, hand sanitizer and food in response to the nationwide coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Transportation Department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration announced the nationwide exemption late Friday, following President Trump's declaration of a national emergency over the pandemic.\n\nThe move \"will help America's commercial drivers get these critical goods to impacted areas faster and more efficiently,\" FMCSA Acting Administrator Jim Mullen said.\n\nIt comes as hospitals report shortages of medical masks and as retailers and manufacturers are straining under surging demand for everything from hand sanitizer to staples such as toilet paper and rice. As anxious consumers stockpile goods, grocers have turned to rationing, imposing purchase limits on disinfectant wipes, cleaning supplies and other high-demand products.\n\nThe move is the first time the FMCSA has issued nationwide-wide relief from hours-of-service regulations, although regional declarations have waived those rules in response to disasters such as hurricanes.\n\nFederal regulations limit most commercial truck drivers to 11 hours of driving time in a 14-hour workday, restrictions intended to reduce accidents caused by highway fatigue.\n\nThe national emergency declaration applies to carriers providing direct assistance to relief efforts tied to the coronavirus pandemic, such as moving medical supplies and equipment to test, diagnose and treat Covid-19. It also applies to those hauling goods to help prevent its spread, including masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfectants.\n\nDrivers transporting \"food for emergency restocking of stores\" are also covered by the declaration.\n\nIt also applies to motor carriers moving medical and emergency services providers, people needed to set up and manage temporary housing and quarantine facilities, and people being moved for medical, isolation or quarantine purposes, the agency said.\n\nThe declaration doesn't apply to routine commercial deliveries or truckers hauling mixed loads that include essential supplies. Drivers that inform motor carriers they need immediate rest must be permitted at least 10 consecutive hours off duty.\n\nCoronavirus Free to Read\n\nLive Updates\n\nWhat We Know\n\nYou Ask, We Answer\n\nHow to Navigate the Crisis\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The futures contracts earlier hit the 5% maximum allowed in a single session, breaching the limit for the first time since shortly after President Trump's 2016 election victory.\n\nSaudi Arabia's decision over the weekend to instigate a price war as it escalates a clash with Russia sent oil prices to their lowest levels since 2016 and raised fresh concerns about the risks tied to heavily indebted energy companies in the high-yield credit market. The kingdom cut most of its oil prices and plans to boost output, despite existing threats to demand from the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nThe move added to two weeks of turmoil in equity and credit markets as investors have grown increasingly concerned about economic growth stalling as public-health authorities escalate efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, leading to a drop in business activity and curtailing global trade.\n\nThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases exceeded 105,000 on Sunday, as infections spread to new parts of the US and Italy quarantined some 17 million people. At least eight American states including New York have declared states of emergency.\n\n\"The fear today is about a global recession,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital, a hedge fund-management firm based in New York. He said lower oil prices make it more likely some companies would default on their debts.\n\nUS government bonds, which have already rallied to unprecedented highs, extended gains. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which moves inversely to bond prices, dropped to 0.481%. The 30-year yield fell below 1%, reaching 0.881%.\n\nIf Russia doesn't come back to the negotiation table soon, investors worry that companies will default, making banks less willing to lend, and causing the economy to stutter, he said. Stocks in the European energy sector led markets lower Monday, with BP plummeting over 17% in London, while Norway's Equinor, Italy's Eni and the U.K.'s BHP Group dropped over 14%. Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell and France's Total were also among the big decliners.\n\nThe price war between major oil producers is \"throwing petrol on the fire\" at a time when investors are struggling to understand how deeply the outbreak will impact global supply chains and consumer spending, according to Lyn Graham-Taylor, a rates strategist at Rabobank.\n\n\"We have got a massive demand decline brought about by the virus and now you've got headline inflation going through the floor: all combinations that say we need to do more easing,\" Mr. Graham-Taylor said.\n\nOver in Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped almost 5% with key equity benchmarks in the U.K. and France entering bear-market territory.\n\nForeign-exchange markets also faced renewed volatility on Monday, as steep drops in oil sparked a flight from commodity-linked currencies. The Russian ruble lost 7.3%, while the Norwegian Krone dropped 2.6%.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, the S&P/ASX 200 index in Australia dropped 7.3%, suffering its worst day since October 2008, during the depths of the global financial crisis. That puts the gauge close to bear-market territory, which is typically defined as a peak-to-trough decline of more than 20%. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed down 5.1%, its biggest daily drop since 2016, while the benchmark stock index in Shanghai dropped more than 3%.\n\nThe Japanese yen, which often rallies in times of market stress, surged to trade below 103 to the dollar, at its strongest levels since 2016. Gold, which is also normally considered a haven asset during times of turmoil, edged down 0.3%.\n\n\"We are in uncharted territory now,\" according to Hubert de Barochez, markets economist at Capital Economics. \"Up until last week, what we were seeing was bond yields lower, stocks hurt and riskier currencies getting hit, but the idea was that if good news were to come all these moves would revert.\"\n\nWrite to David Winning at david.winning@wsj.com, Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com and Xie Yu at Yu.Xie@wsj.com", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

They do it for too little time, or they don't do it at all.\n\nProper handwashing means scrubbing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nYet just 5% of people spent more than 15 seconds washing their hands after using the restroom, and 10% didn't wash their hands at all, in a study of 3,749 college students published in the Journal of Environmental Health in 2013.\n\nHow to Wash Your Hands\n\nHands are villages to thousands of germs -- including bacteria and viruses. All it takes is a friendly handshake to spread respiratory diseases like Covid-19, the disease caused by the new virus. Respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes can also spread these germs, as can touching surfaces like doorknobs and phones where those droplets may have landed.\n\n\"I don't think we need to panic,\" says Elaine Larson, professor emerita of nursing research at the Columbia School of Nursing, who has helped the World Health Organization develop handwashing guidelines. \"But we do need to be reminded about basic hygiene.\"\n\nThe virus's fate is in your hands -- literally -- so experts say it's time to start practicing what science is preaching.\n\n-- Use soap. Before applying soap to your hands, run water over them. Soap and water together, with rubbing, is what helps rinse organisms off your hands and down the drain. Don't worry about removing hand jewelry, Dr. Larson says. Those need to be washed, too.\n\nSoap acts as a surfactant: a substance that helps release bacteria's grip from your hand when water is added. The study of college students, however, showed only two in three people used soap. The rest just rinsed their hands.\n\nDr. Larson suggests half a teaspoon of liquid soap is enough, or a glob about the size of a quarter, although bigger hands might need more. Health experts say that too much soap can remove your skin's natural oils, which have helpful antibacterial properties.\n\nThe CDC says studies haven't shown that soaps with antibacterial ingredients provide any health benefits or remove more germs than plain soaps. All soaps, however, can deactivate a coronavirus so it can no longer infect you.\n\nThe new coronavirus, coined SARS-CoV-2, is a spherical structure with spiky proteins attached to a membrane, or envelope, that protects the pathogen's genetic material. Once it comes into contact with soap, this envelope dissolves, leaving behind a dysfunctional virus.\n\n\"The envelope is a machine that allows the virus to sneak into human cells,\" says Jonathan Abraham, an assistant professor of microbiology at Harvard Medical School. \"Without it, the virus cannot infect you.\"\n\n-- Scrub all surfaces of your hands. People on average wash their hands for only about six seconds, according to several studies. Twenty seconds is what's recommended -- or, the length of the \"Happy Birthday\" song sung twice -- though it depends on what you touched and how often.\n\nAnd even 20 seconds \"is not helpful if you're not washing the right places,\" Dr. Larson says. \"It's about quality, not quantity.\"\n\nThe most vulnerable parts of your hands are your fingertips, between your fingers, the backs of your hands and under your nails. Rubbing these surfaces with enough force is critical, health experts say. People who have longer nails should be extra cautious, they add.\n\nScrubbing too hard or too frequently can damage your skin by making it dry and more susceptible to cracking, Dr. Larson says. Cuts and cracks give germs the perfect spot to set up shop. To avoid skin damage, Dr. Larson recommends using a moisturizer after washing.\n\nStudies have shown that water temperature doesn't affect how many germs are removed. The CDC says warm or cold water will do, but some experts warn that when water is too hot, it can also damage skin.\n\nAfter a thorough scrub with soap, remove all suds by rubbing every surface of your hands under running, clean water to ensure that pathogens get washed away, Dr. Abraham says. Leaving some soap behind may also soak up moisture from your hands, leaving them dry and more likely to crack.\n\n-- Dry your hands completely. Now it's time to dry your hands as thoroughly as you can, because moist hands give living organisms a better chance of surviving and spreading to others, Dr. Abraham says.\n\nThe CDC says there is not enough data to confirm whether a significant amount of germs are transferred from the faucet knob to your hands. Some experts suggest using a paper towel to turn the water off, while others discourage it because it wastes paper towels.\n\nAutomatic blowers and paper towels both dry hands well.\n\n-- Use alcohol-based sanitizers in a pinch. If you're on the go, alcohol-based sanitizers are great alternatives to soap and water. They cannot kill all viruses, like the norovirus, which lacks a dissolvable envelope. But a sanitizer can kill any coronavirus on your hands as long as it's made up of at least 60% alcohol, health experts say. Plain rubbing alcohol also works, but sanitizers maintain a balance of alcohol and other ingredients to help keep skin healthy and moisturized.\n\nIt's important to use enough sanitizer to cover the entire hand. Dr. Larson suggests half to one teaspoon.\n\nSanitizer also works only when it's still wet, so health experts advise against using paper towels to dab your hands. Give the product at least 10 seconds to complete its job, then rub your hands together or let them air-dry.\n\nGet an early-morning coronavirus briefing each weekday, plus a health-news update Fridays: Sign up.\n\nCoronavirus Free to Read\n\nLive Updates\n\nWhat We Know\n\nYou Ask, We Answer\n\nMs. Camero is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Doctors said there is no risk to those who have had recent contact with Mr. Trudeau because he hasn't had symptoms, the prime minister's office said.\n\n\"The Prime Minister will continue to fully assume his duties and will address Canadians tomorrow,\" the statement said.\n\nMs. Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau was tested for the new coronavirus after she began having mild flulike symptoms including a low fever late Wednesday night. Ms. Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau's symptoms remain mild and she is feeling well, the prime minister's office said. She had recently returned from a speaking engagement in London.\n\n\"We will get through this situation together,\" Ms. Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau said in a statement. \"Please share the facts and take your health seriously.\"\n\nMr. Trudeau's possible exposure to the virus first came under scrutiny this week after health authorities said a man tested positive after attending a major mining conference early this month where the Canadian leader delivered a keynote address.\n\nMore than 100 Canadians have tested positive for the coronavirus and one person has died.\n\nRegional authorities on Thursday stepped up their containment efforts, with new measures in parts of the country including bans on large gatherings and school closures. Some provinces also advised people not to travel outside the country -- including to the U.S. -- and told those who do travel to isolate themselves for 14 days after returning to Canada.\n\nWrite to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Private companies, including JD.com Inc. JD 3.79% and Walmart Inc., WMT 9.66% rerouted trucks and located supplies that otherwise might not have made it to market.\n\nAfter Beijing called for an increase in face mask production, manufacturers canceled holidays for workers and jacked up wages to increase production of basic medical supplies. When Beijing issued orders against price gouging, companies looked for sudden price spikes and cut off guilty shopkeepers, or found ways to make more products available.\n\nShopping app Pinduoduo Inc. got more farmers to use their online marketplaces, enabling them to sell more widely. By targeting soon-to-expire foods that might ordinarily have been thrown away by suppliers, Walmart was able to locate a massive batch of cucumbers in Yunnan province. Staff members worked through the night at a distribution center to test and sort the cucumbers for delivery to stores the next morning.\n\n\"The only element of physical commerce that really stayed close to normal is the supermarket,\" said Michael Norris, a Shanghai-based research and strategy manager at Agency China, a market research firm. \"The supermarket has really been the lifeblood of the community during this event.\"\n\nOther countries, including the U.S. and Japan, are grappling with how to keep supplies available as the coronavirus spreads. In the U.S., supermarkets have rationed some items and are considering cutting operating hours and tapping volunteers to deliver food.\n\nIt isn't clear if other countries will want to go as far as China, whose central government intervenes often in commerce. China has also had problems of its own making to deal with -- including navigating the rigid quarantine restrictions enacted by Beijing.\n\nPanic buying did appear in some parts of the country and some products have remained in short supply. There was also some luck in the epidemic's timing, since many households were stocked up for the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nFood inflation countrywide rose 21.9% in February from a year earlier. But much of the increase was due to pork prices, which have been battered by African swine fever.\n\nIt could have been worse. Lu Jie, who runs a small shop in Beijing selling everything from Twix bars to dried fruits, said she initially had to rely on supplies left over from the prior season. Many products couldn't get into Beijing because of quarantine restrictions.\n\nThis week, she said, more of her old suppliers were reappearing, as trucks found more ways to get through roadblocks. With business still slow, she said she already had most of what she needed.\n\nA few weeks earlier, it seemed likely that China would endure crippling goods shortages.\n\nSo many people in rural areas were forbidden to enter and exit their communities that vegetables couldn't be shipped out. Some places disallowed harvesting of certain foods outright, including green onions and cauliflower, citing a need to contain the epidemic.\n\nRoads became nearly impassable due to government blockades. Many truck drivers were forced into quarantine because they had been in exposed areas. Food shipments dropped dramatically at ports, with international deliveries canceled.\n\nIn response, China's government released more than 300,000 tons of pork from central and local strategic reserves, adding more meat to the market.\n\nRelying on a Ministry of Commerce emergency commodity database, authorities reached out to hundreds of businesses to gather information about supplies of rice, vegetables and other products, and began connecting buyers with available sellers.\n\nTo make sure goods got through roadblocks, the government established a \"green channel\" system that allowed truck drivers to travel between cities with special passes. Some local governments hired truck drivers to keep supplies flowing.\n\nHigh-Speed Trains, International Flights: How the Coronavirus Spread\n\nThe city of Chongqing, in central China, hired a local trucking firm called Circle Logistics Co. that normally serves factories operated by Foxconn Technology Group 2317 -0.13% and Corning Inc. to deliver vegetables, drugs and face masks, said Robin Zheng, its owner.\n\n\"Moving vegetables isn't our usual work,\" said Mr. Zheng. \"But this is the job right now: delivering food.\"\n\nTo ensure buyers didn't hoard and store owners didn't engage in price-gouging, Beijing announced strict prohibitions on such activities, while some local governments punished outlets that jacked up prices. Costco Wholesale Corp. and other grocery chains agreed to limit the number of customers allowed into stores and to stop selling some popular products to lower store visits.\n\nJingkelong Supermarket in Beijing set up lines for customers to enter, with each person standing one meter apart. Customers were given cards to return upon exit, allowing another person to enter.\n\nPinduoduo, which is especially popular among consumers in smaller cities, promoted a recently-created platform that helps farmers find alternative buyers. Ning Qiang, a 32-year-old businessman from Sichuan province, used the service after figs he sourced from farms -- which can only survive for 10 days after they are picked -- went unsold during the Lunar New Year. He eventually found buyers.\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nAre you concerned about whether your supermarket will remain stocked in the coming weeks? Join the conversation below.\n\nJD.com said when inventories in its warehouses for products like rice, flour and oil started getting tight, it was able to source additional supplies from offline businesses -- including mom and pop stores -- that were open and closest to customers. In many cases, an order on JD.com was supplied by a courier coming directly from the customer's local convenience store.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA 4.81% said its various food-delivery platforms hired thousands of people who were unable to return to their usual jobs and put them to work delivering supplies to people. At one point when all roads were blocked in an area where a father who was desperate for baby formula lived, sorting station manager Ning Yang carried the baby formula herself, walking more than two kilometers to deliver it to the buyer's door.\n\nMore on the Coronavirus Coronavirus Forces New Travel Curbs, Bans on Large Gatherings U.S. to Ban Travel From Europe for 30 Days Coronavirus Declared a Pandemic by World Health Organization What Happened When One Student Got Coronavirus on a Trip to Barcelona How China Slowed Coronavirus: Lockdowns, Surveillance, Enforcers\n\n-- Xiao Xiao and Trefor Moss contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Julie Wernau at Julie.Wernau@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The CDC says it has since remedied those issues.\n\nSince then, the FDA has given permission to hundreds of U.S. academic hospital labs to immediately begin using their own tests for the new coronavirus without first obtaining emergency authorization. The labs are supposed to follow certain steps to validate their own tests, and to ultimately seek FDA authorization.\n\nCurrently, all testing is based on identifying unique portions of the new coronavirus's genetic sequence. But Roche's tests can be conducted faster than manual laboratory tests. Its machines provide results in three and a half hours and can run many tests in parallel -- though as they are located in laboratories, it will take additional time for samples to be sent for testing. Its most advanced machine can process around 4,128 samples every 24 hours.\n\nSo far, over 13,000 patient specimens have been tested by CDC and state public-health labs in the U.S., according to figures CDC posted online.\n\nWhile capacity has increased, the rollout has been in a patchwork fashion that still isn't meeting demand for tests.\n\nThe spotty rollout of testing in the U.S. has become a contentious political issue, with members of Congress criticizing the Trump administration for not having better testing capacity. The Trump administration has said that sufficient test kits are available.\n\nAn \"emergency team\" of Roche scientists started work on a new test as soon as China shared the genetic sequence of the virus in January. It normally takes years for a new test to be developed and approved, according to Roche Diagnostics Chief Executive Thomas Schinecker.\n\nThe company has also been working closely with the CDC in the past few weeks to install more machines across the U.S., said Mr. Schinecker.\n\nOther diagnostic equipment makers also have been developing new coronavirus tests, including Qiagen NV, BioMerieux and Abbott Laboratories. Some hospital systems in the U.S. have developed their own tests, which will have to seek FDA approval.\n\nWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com and Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"Facts (and Myths) About Boosting Your Immune System", "body": "It's crucial to stay healthy as the threat of coronavirus spreads. Here are the best strategies. By Sumathi Reddy Sumathi Reddy The Wall Street Journal BiographySumathi Reddy @rddysum Sumathi.Reddy@wsj.com March 12, 2020 7:56 pm ET\n\nAs the new coronavirus continues to spread across the country, having an optimally functioning immune system is more important than ever.\n\nMedical professionals say it is important not to rush to buy supplements and vitamins that promise to enhance your immune system; there isn't much evidence that such products do any good. Instead, they say, stick with the more mundane, but proven, approaches:\n\n* Keep your stress levels down. It's a bit of a vicious cycle, of course: The more you stress about the virus, the more likely you are to suffer from it. \"Stress can certainly hurt your immune system,\" says Morgan Katz, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University. \"Do not panic, try to minimize stress.\"\n\nAndrew Diamond, chief medical officer of One Medical, a nationwide network of primary-care providers, says the stress hormone cortisol turns off cells in your immune system. He recommends engaging in activities that people find relaxing, such as meditation.\n\n* Exercise. Low- and moderate-intensity exercise naturally lowers cortisol levels and helps with immune-system function, says Dr. Diamond. One Medical recommends 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day. If you're apprehensive about germs in the gym, walk or run outside.\n\nBut it is important not to go overboard. A recent study found high-performance athletes have an increased risk of infection, says Elizabeth Bradley, medical director of the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Functional Medicine. \"Exercise helps boost the immune system, but we have to be careful not to overexercise because it can weaken your immune system,\" she says.\n\n* Get adequate sleep. For adults, that means getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Children should get more, depending on their age.\n\n* Make sure your vaccines are up-to-date, especially the flu vaccine.\n\n* Eat plenty of plain yogurt every day. \"It's really an easy way to boost your probiotics and help support your microbiome,\" Dr. Katz says. \"It helps to support the good bacteria that live in your body, which help to fight bad bacteria or viruses.\"\n\nDr. Katz also suggests avoiding antibiotics unless you must take them because they deplete the good bacteria in the system, leaving you more vulnerable to other infections.\n\nOther foods that can help support the microbiome include garlic, onion, ginger, sauerkraut and fermented foods, says Dr. Bradley.\n\n* Watch your diet. Stick to a healthful, balanced diet filled with lots of colorful fruits and vegetables to ensure you're getting enough zinc and vitamin D and other important vitamins and minerals. Most experts say you should be able to get enough of these vitamins and minerals through your diet, and extra supplementation isn't necessary. But because vitamin D deficiency is relatively common, experts do recommend supplementation if levels are low.\n\nDr. Bradley recommends eating lots of dark green, leafy vegetables and berries, as well as nuts and seeds, and to minimize foods with sugar and trans fats, which aren't as nutrient-dense.\n\nYour immune system needs fuel, so avoid ultralow-carbohydrate diets, experts say. In addition, drink lots of water and reduce alcohol consumption, which can disrupt your sleep.\n\n* Stop smoking or vaping. Smokers and those with respiratory disease have a higher rate of serious illness and complications from coronavirus. \"Anything that is challenging to your lungs is going to work in the wrong direction,\" says Dr. Diamond.\n\nMs. Reddy writes the Your Health column for Personal Journal.
