While discussing the coronavirus during Tuesday's debate, those candidates blamed President Trump for restricting resources for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\n\"There's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. And he's defunded -- he's defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing,\" Bloomberg said.\n\nBiden similarly indicated Trump reversed the Obama-Biden administration's budget increases to those agencies.\n\nCORONAVIRUS GETS POLITICAL: TRUMP, DEMS EXCHANGE BARBS AS US PREPARES FOR POTENTIAL CRISIS\n\n\"We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. ... He's wiped all that out. ... He cut the funding for the entire effort,\" he said.\n\nBut according to the AP, Trump's proposed budget cuts never went into effect. Funding to fight the latest outbreak also came from a congressional fund created for health emergencies.\n\nSome public health experts say a bigger concern than White House budgets is the steady erosion of a CDC grant program for state and local public health emergency preparedness -- the front lines in detecting and battling new disease. But that decline was set in motion by a congressional budget measure that predates Trump.\n\nThe broader point about there being \"nobody here\" to coordinate the response sells short what's in place to handle an outbreak.\n\nBiden's and Bloomberg's campaigns didn't immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.\n\nVARNEY: DEMS 'DRUMMING UP PANIC' ABOUT CORONAVIRUS, DRIVING DOWN MARKETS\n\nThe fact check came as the administration criticized Democrats over their handling of the issue.\n\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, Trump derided House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., over the issue.\n\n\"She wants to do the same thing with cryin' Chuck Schumer. He goes out and he says the president only asked for $2.5 billion, he should have $8.5 billion. This is the first time I've ever been told that we should take more. Usually, it's we have to take less,\" Trump said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe White House is requesting $1.25 billion in new funding and wants to transfer $535 million more from an Ebola preparedness account -- a move opposed by Democrats. The administration anticipates shifting money from other Department of Health and Human Services accounts and other agencies to complete the $2.5 billion response plan.\n\nOn Thursday, Schumer and Pelosi issued a statement calling for additional action in response to the crisis -- warning that \"lives are at stake -- this is not the time for name-calling or playing politics.\"", "source":

task force meeting in the White House situation room.\n\nWATCH LIVE COVERAGE ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL AND FOXNEWS.COM\n\nIt's the second time this week Trump will speak to reporters in a rare White House briefing room press conference, signaling the seriousness the Administration is placing on the coronavirus that has now infected more than 85,000 worldwide and killed 2,900.\n\nThe closures and quarantines around the world have spooked investors and the stock market took a dramatic tumble this week.\n\nShortly before Trump was to address the cameras, Washington state health officials said one person has died from the new virus; the first person to die from the disease in the United States.\n\nNews of the death comes on the heels of three new cases in California, Oregon and Washington in which the patients were infected by unknown means. They had not recently traveled overseas or had come into contact with anyone who had.\n\nAs new cases have popped up in the United States, tensions between Trump and Democrats are bubbling up as well.\n\nAt a rally in South Carolina Friday night, Trump accused his Democratic critics of \"politicizing\" the coronavirus outbreak and dismissed the criticism about his handling of the virus as \"their new hoax\" and insisted \"we are totally prepared.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the House held a bipartisan briefing with health officials Friday morning, leaving Democrats questioning whether Trump has a handle on the response.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who led the impeachment fight, said Friday he has \"profound concerns\" about Trump's response to the coronavirus and cast doubt on whether the White House is telling the truth to the American public about the global outbreak.\n\n\"The president and vice president don't inspire confidence,\" Schiff told Fox News as he left a coronavirus briefing at the Capitol Friday morning. \"And because the president has made so many false statements about so many things, you can't really rely on the White House.\"\n\nSchiff's comments come after Trump blasted Democrats in a tweetstorm for playing politics with the coronavirus threat.\n\n\"I have profound concerns about the management of this at the level of the White House,\" Schiff said, \"but there are some good career people who we got the opportunity to talk to today.\"\n\nAs of Friday, there were 62 confirmed cases in the U.S., including 44 who were repatriated from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship, but it's unclear what the total figure is as of Saturday afternoon.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marisa_schultz@foxnews.com", "name": "Marisa Schultz",

CNN's media newsletter even criticized Trump when covering coronavirus, bashing the president for spending 45 minutes on Thursday meeting with people who aren't involved in fighting the virus.\n\nUS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES MONITORING WORLDWIDE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS, CONCERNS IN INDIA, IRAN: REPORT\n\nHouck said that it's Trump's responsibility to maintain a \"certain level of calm\" and it would be \"irresponsible\" if he ran around and stoked fear - but CNN would have found a way to criticize Trump regardless of what approach he took.\n\nAnderson Cooper has been snarky about Trump's response, Chris Cuomo compared coronavirus to 9/11 and several CNN reporters have dedicated time to politicizing coronavirus on social media.\n\n\"Trump Derangement Syndrome strikes again,\" Houck said. \"It's one thing to talk about disagreements, even with say, a Supreme Court Justice, or tax policy, but it's a completely separate factor when you're talking about things that we cannot control like hurricanes or these viruses that we know very little about.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThursday marked Pence's first day leading the country's coronavirus response after Trump announced he would take on the role in a Wednesday evening press conference. Pence sought to ease Americans' fears by citing the low number of U.S. cases of the virus that originated in China -- calling the current risk it poses to Americans \"low\" -- as he defended Trump's response to the crisis in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Thursday.\n\n\"We continue to prepare for whatever may come, but the reality is that because of the actions that President Trump took ... literally, you know, ending travel, closing our borders to people coming in from China, establishing a quarantine process, setting up a task force,\" Pence said. \"I mean if the president hadn't taken those unprecedented steps we'd be in a very different place today.\"\n\nCoronavirus politics has also infected the presidential campaign trail, with several 2020 candidates panning the president

"Trump says coronavirus vaccine coming along 'rapidly,' appoints Pence to head task force", "body": "As Americans' fears grow of a possible coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., President Trump was addressing the nation in a Wednesday evening news conference at the White House to discuss how his administration was handling the virus threat -- saying that a vaccine is being developed \"rapidly\" and \"coming along very well.\"\n\nHowever, Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said later at the press conference that a vaccine would not be applicable to the epidemic for a \"year to a year-and-a-half,\" due to delays from testing, development, production, and distribution.\n\nTrump also hit back at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, calling her \"incompetent\" after she challenged his response to the virus. \"I think she's not thinking about the country; instead of making a statement like that, where I've been beating her routinely at everything ... she should be saying we should work together.\"\n\nThe president also announced he was putting Vice President Mike Pence \"in charge\" of coronavirus prevention efforts, effective immediately. The White House had reportedly considered naming a virus czar to be the point person on the disease.\n\n\"Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low,\" Trump said. \"We're ready to adapt, and we're ready to do whatever we have to.\"\n\nThe president revealed that of the \"15\" Americans confirmed to have the virus, eight have \"returned to their homes to stay in their homes until fully recovered, one is in the hospital, and five have fully recovered; and one is, uh, we think in pretty good shape, and is in between hospital and going home.\" Trump later said the person was \"pretty sick and hopefully will recover.\"\n\nSo far, there have been 60 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. in total. That figure includes individuals who have been repatriated to the United States, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar later clarified at the podium. 15 people were in the initial set of cases, three came more from evacuation flights, and 42 from the Diamond Princess ship that was quarantined by Japanese health authorities earlier this month.\n\nAzar warned that the \"degree of risk has the potential to change quickly.\"\n\nEven as he reassured Americans that \"great quarantine facilities\" have been set up, Trump noted that the scale of the virus has been somewhat misrepresentated. He said he was \"shocked\" and \"amazed\" when he spoke to medical experts to hear that the flu kills from 25,000 to 69,000 people per year. By contrast, only 2,700 people globally have been confirmed killed by coronavirus, although China and other countries are likely not reporting accurate numbers.\n\n\"We're ready to adapt, and we're ready to do whatever we have to.\"\n\n-- President Trump\n\nThe U.S. is the most prepared country in the world to handle an epidemic, Trump said, citing Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSeparately, Trump said the stock market was foundering \"because of this,\" but also in part because the public is worried one of the Democrats running for president might win and impose socialist policies.\n\nEarlier in the day, after two days of the stock market tumbling, Trump blamed the media and Democrats for causing undue alarm and harming American financial markets. On Twitter, he singled out MSNBC and CNN for \"doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible.\"\n\n\"Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action,\" Trump continued. \"USA in great shape!\n\nIn advance of his primetime address, Trump played down the mortality rate for a pathogen. His top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, echoed Trump's outlook, saying Tuesday that the U.S. had \"contained\" the threat of a domestic outbreak.\n\nTrump's and Kudlow's comments were apparently at odds with warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials who said that American communities need to prepare now for when the disease starts spreading domestically.\n\nBut reports in South Korean media and the Los Angeles Times said a Korean Air cabin crew member who tested positive for the disease may have worked on flights between Seoul and Los Angeles -- a development that could have exposed Americans and people coming into America to the virus that takes up to 14 days after exposure to trigger symptoms, according to the CDC.\n\nCORONAVIRUS FITS CRITERIA FOR 'DISEASE X,' WHO EXPERT SAYS\n\nOn Capitol Hill, senior lawmakers called for a bipartisan spending package that would give federal, state and local officials more resources. Congress in recent years took a similar approach with the opioid epidemic, pumping out federal dollars for treatment and prevention. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York unveiled an $8.5 billion coronavirus proposal.\n\nDemocrats did not mince words on the matter. \"The Trump administration is absolutely bungling the response to coronavirus, putting our public health and our economy at risk,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said earlier this week. \"This is why we need a real plan and an adult in charge.\"\n\n\"Trump is putting American lives at risk every day, ignoring science, claiming the virus will 'miraculously' disappear by April and relying on 'warm weather' to end the spread of the virus,\" presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg's campaign said in a press release. \"It is clearer than ever that the country needs a leader with real experience managing a crisis.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG SLAMS TRUMP'S HANDLING OF CORONAVIRUS\n\nThere have been renewed signs that the economy will continue to be affected internationally. Microsoft on Wednesday its supply chain is being hurt by the virus outbreak in China and the company will return to normal operations at a slower pace than expected.\n\nThe tech giant had predicted it would make between $10.75 billion and $11.15 billion in revenue from its personal computing segment in the January-March quarter. But Microsoft now says the supply chain for its Windows business and Surface devices \"are more negatively impacted than previously anticipated.\"\n\nAnd last week, Apple warned investors that it won't meet its second-quarter financial guidance because the viral outbreak in China has cut production of iPhones. The Cupertino, California-based company said all of its iPhone manufacturing facilities in China have reopened, but production is ramping up slowly. The company said demand for iPhones was also down in China because Apple's retail stores are closed or operating with reduced hours.\n\nBroadly, major U.S. stock indexes gave up early gains and closed mostly lower Wednesday, extending the market's heavy losses for the week. The benchmark S&P 500 fell for the fifth straight day after swinging between a 0.6 percent loss and 1.7 percent gain. Smaller company stocks bore the brunt of the selling. The bond market continued to flash warning signs as long-term Treasury yields fell further below short-term yields.\n\nCORONAVIRUS DISRUPTION TO 'EVERYDAY' LIFE IN US 'MAY BE SEVERE,' CDC OFFICIAL SAYS\n\nWorry about economic fallout from the virus outbreak that originated in China has fueled a sharp sell-off this week that's wiped out the market's gains for the year.\n\n\"The messaging by the White House is unhelpful,\" said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. \"What the White House is doing is conveying a sense of overconfidence. ... Of course, we do want to maintain calm with the public, but it flies in the face of facts. There is strong likelihood that we will see an outbreak in the United States and that we could see community transmission.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST ON CORONAVIRUS\n\nTrump's public efforts to project calm masked a behind-the-scenes focus. During his 36-hour visit to India, Trump received briefings from staff and periodically checked the impact on Wall Street, tweeting at all hours to try to reassure Americans and the markets about the spread of the virus.\n\nTrump reportedly expressed deep concern to aides about the impact on the markets, according to White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing. Trump has tied his fortunes to Wall Street more closely than any of his recent predecessors and has made a strong economy his No. 1 one argument for reelection.\n\nAs the media coverage of the virus has increased, Trump has grown concerned that even fears of an outbreak would stagger Wall Street, leading him to wonder aloud if Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was the right person to lead the administration's response, the officials said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Americans want to see their president taking charge and showing leadership, and that is exactly what President Trump is doing,\" said Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany. \"In restricting travel and implementing quarantines, President Trump has taken unprecedented action to protect American citizens from the coronavirus.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregg_re@foxnews.com", "name": "Gregg Re", "type": "author",

my fellow citizens would be two-fold: be just as vigilant as you always should be -- even during flu season. But, more importantly, this virus does not care what your political ideation is. This virus doesn't care what your nationality is.\"\n\n\"If there's anything that ought to be unifying in this country, it should be a desire for the world and our country specifically to be safe from this virus,\" said Gowdy. \"So, it breaks my heart to see it politicized.\"\n\nKRIS KOBACH WARNS SOUTHERN BORDER COULD BE 'WIDE-OPEN DOORWAY' FOR THOSE INFECTED WITH CORONAVIRUS\n\nThere have been 85,000 cases reported worldwide in nearly 60 countries with new cases reported Saturday. Nearly 3,000 people have died.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, the CDC had reported 62 confirmed cases in the United States and among persons repatriated to the United States. However, since then, new cases were announced in Washington state, Oregon, and California and an interactive COVID-19 map of Global Cases by Johns Hopkins currently shows 66 confirmed U.S. cases.\n\nLater Saturday, health officials in Washington state reported one of those infected had died, the first such death in the United States.\n\nAs the number of cases continually rise, stock markets around the world continue to plunge.\n\nOn Friday, the Dow Jones index took another hit closing down nearly 360 points. The index has dropped more than 14 percent from a recent high, making this the market's worst week since 2008.\n\nEconomists have predicted global growth will slip 2.4 percent this year -- the slowest since the Great Recession in 2009. For the United States, forecasts are falling to as low as 1.7 percent growth this year.\n\n\"I'm way too poor to be an expert on the stock market,\" joked Gowdy.\n\n\"I do think -- you know -- I think [Mick Mulvaney] the other day told folks to turn off their television for 24 hours and [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer criticized him for it. I think that Mickey's point is: there are lots of things to be worried about in the world and when you focus a disproportionate amount of attention on this with the morbidity and mortality rates actually not being any higher than the flu and lower than SARS and MERS, then yes you can create this narrative.\"\n\n\"Everywhere I go, people are talking about the coronavirus...but the flu kills

Fox News' David Spunt reports from the White House.\n\nThe coronavirus has yet again exposed the strong contrast between President Trump - who is working ardently for the American people - and a Democratic Party with little interest in anything besides taking him down.\n\nPresident Trump, for his part, has taken unprecedented action to thwart the spread of the virus.\n\nThe president issued a travel ban to stop the spread of the virus by travelers from affected regions, announcing additional travel restrictions during a Saturday news conference.\n\nPERSON DIES FROM CORONAVIRUS IN WASHINGTON STATE, FIRST IN THE US, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY\n\nTrump announced mandatory quarantines and a public health emergency. And he formed a Coronavirus Task Force and appointed Vice President Mike Pence to lead the effort to orchestrate a coronavirus response.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats and the anti-Trump media have done little more than complain, point fingers, and politicize what should be an issue engendering bipartisan response.\n\nSen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., falsely accused the president of having no plan to deal with the coronavirus, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issuing a 52-page planned response.\n\nSome 60 percent of CNN's questions to coronavirus-related guests invited criticism of the Trump presidency. Further exposing its bias, CNN cut away from President Trump's news conference on the coronavirus to televise flailing Democratic candidate Mike Bloomberg's presidential town hall.\n\nThe New York Times published a column by Gail Collins that dubbed the coronavirus the \"Trumpvirus.\" The newspaper's continually wrong economics columnist Paul Krugman appeared to celebrate fall in the stock market.\n\nRecall that Krugman predicted \"a global recession, with no end in sight\" if Donald Trump was elected president. In reality, Trump's election spurred a period of continued growth and the hottest economy in modern history.\n\nThe left's panic and politicization of the coronavirus is not unusual. It is the typical reaction for a party and a media hoping desperately to see the end of the Trump presidency.\n\nLiberal Democrats peddled an unfounded conspiracy theory alleging Trump-Russia collusion, only to be rebuked by Special Counsel Robert Mueller nearly two years later.\n\nLiberal Democrats then spun a Ukraine quid pro quo theory, which ended in the Senate's exoneration of President Trump.\n\nAnd then, when the yield curve was momentarily inverted at the end of 2019, the media broke into utter and sheer panic, suggesting a recession was on the horizon.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn fact, the Trump economy continued to boom with new home sales reaching the highest level in over 12 years, consumer confidence in the economy continuing to break records, and paychecks rising fastest for low- and middle-income Americans.\n\nRather than politicizing the coronavirus and myriad other situations, Democrats should work on a bipartisan basis with the president to solve them.\n\nAs President Trump aptly noted Saturday: \"We would respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite panic because there's no reason to panic at all. This is something that is being handled professionally.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIndeed, President Trump has proven himself the professional - the adult in the room as Democrats act like small children, incapable of stepping up to the task at hand and certainly incapable of leading the nation.\n\nLet the coronavirus and the Democratic response be a clear sign that America simply cannot afford a Democrat prevailing in the presidential election in November.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

coronavirus patients without gear, training", "body": "Chief Mississippi state health officer and infectious disease expert Dr. Thomas Dobbs weighs in on the coronavirus outbreak on 'Outnumbered Overtime.'\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services \"improperly deployed\" more than a dozen workers to two California military bases receiving Americans evacuated from coronavirus without giving them training or protective gear for handling the possibly high-risk patients, according to a new whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe whistleblower alleged that HHS officials shot down her concerns and on Feb. 15 threatened to fire her if she did not accept a reassignment. The workers who may have been exposed to the coronavirus then were able to travel freely among the public, the complaint reportedly said.\n\n\"We are hopeful that Congress and the OSC [the U.S. Office of the Special Counsel] will investigate this case in a timely and comprehensive manner,\" the whistleblower's attorney, Lauren Naylor, told Fox News, adding that the team could not provide a public copy of the complaint. \"This matter concerns HHS's response to the coronavirus, and its failure to protect its employees and potentially the public. The retaliatory efforts to intimidate and silence our client must be opposed.\"\n\nThe New York Times and The Washington Post first reported the story. Zachary Kurz, the communications director for the U.S. Office of the Special Counsel, confirmed to Fox News that the Office of Special Counsel has received the HHS whistleblower's complaint and the case has been assigned.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST ON CORONAVIRUS\n\nIn a primetime press conference Wednesday, President Trump said a vaccine was coming along well, but officials later clarified it wouldn't be ready for approximately a year and a half. The president and his deputies emphasized that the risk to Americans was \"low\" but could potentially increase quickly. Vice President Mike Pence was appointed to oversee efforts to combat the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, California and federal officials on Thursday were in the midst of an intense effort to retrace the movements of a Northern California woman believed to be the first person in the U.S. to contract the highly contagious coronavirus with no known connection to travel abroad or other known causes.\n\nWATCH THE TRUMP CORONAVIRUS PRESS CONFERENCE\n\nThe woman lives in Solano County, home to Travis Air Force Base, where dozens of people infected in China or on cruise ships have been treated.\n\nHowever, Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health, said there was no evidence the woman had any connection to the base.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declined comment when asked by reporters to name the community in Solano County the woman was from but urged people to take precautions while emphasizing that the risks to public health were low. He said there was no need to declare a public health emergency.\n\n\"Everybody in this country is rightfully anxious about this moment,\" Newsom said. \"I think they should know we are meeting this moment with the kind of urgency that is necessary and I don't want to over extend the anxiety.\"\n\nNewsom said the state only has only received about 200 testing kits for the virus, an amount he called \"simply inadequate.\" But he said federal officials have promised him the state will get many more soon.\n\nCDC DIRECTOR SAYS CORONAVIRUS THREAT IN US REMAINS LOW, BUT WARNS THERE WILL BE NEW CASES\n\nCalifornia Health and Human Services Agency Director Mark Ghaly said health officials would change the way they test for the virus by \"shifting from order and community containment to one where we acknowledge that community spread is possible.\" He did not elaborate.\n\nThe woman from Solano County was transferred from the Vacaville hospital to UC Davis Medical Center on Feb. 19, but it took four days for the Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention to approve a request to test the patient for COVID-19, according to a memo posted to the hospital's website from interm CEO Brad Simmons and David Lubarsky, vice chancellor of human health sciences.\n\nThe patient arrived on a ventilator and special protection orders were issued \"because of an undiagnosed and suspected viral condition,\" according to the memo.\n\nThe hospital asked the CDC to test for the coronavirus but testing was delayed until Sunday \"since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID-19,\" the memo said.\n\nCORONAVIRUS INFECTS WOMAN IN JAPAN FOR SECOND TIME, A FIRST IN THE COUNTRY\n\n\"While this is considered a serious public health threat, the risk to Solano County residents and the general public is low at this time,\" the county health department said.\n\nUC Davis Medical Center, which has treated other coronavirus patients, has been taking infection prevention precautions since the patient arrived. Officials believe there was a small chance that others at the facility were exposed to the virus and they were asked to stay home and monitor their temperatures, the memo said.\n\nAll of the 59 other cases in the U.S. have been for people who had traveled abroad or had close contact with others who traveled. Health officials have been on high alert for so-called community spread.\n\nEarlier U.S. cases included 14 in people who returned from outbreak areas in China or their spouses; three people who were evacuated from the central China city of Wuhan; and 42 American passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were evacuated by the federal government to the U.S. from where the ship was docked in Japan.\n\nThe global count of those sickened by the virus hovered Thursday around 82,000, with 433 new cases reported in China and another 505 in South Korea.\n\nAlthough Trump has projected confidence that the stock market will hold in the long term, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 1,200 points Thursday, deepening a weeklong worldwide rout caused by growing anxiety that the coronavirus will wreak havoc on the global economy. It was the market's worst one-day drop since 2011.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe S&P 500 has now plunged 12 percent from the all-time high it set just a week ago.

Desperate Democrats certainly hope so; they imagine the spreading disease will knock confidence and our robust economy for a loop, undermining President Trump's best argument for reelection.\n\nWho can be surprised? The Democratic primary season has launched Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the aging socialist from Vermont, to a position where he is likely to lead the party in a chorus of \"The Internationale\" while leaping off a cliff in November. Toppling the economy could save them from political oblivion.\n\nNonetheless, even after three years of hateful and harmful \"resistance,\" this is a new low for Democrats.\n\nEven before a single case of the virus erupted organically in our country (as one now apparently has in California), and even as the administration had acted preemptively and effectively to keep virus carriers out of our country, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg and others were eager to stoke fear and blame Donald Trump.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS AND CORONAVIRUS COMBINED DRAGGING DOWN STOCK MARKET: CONNELL MCSHANE\n\nPelosi accused the Trump administration of devaluing \"Americans' health security by ransacking funding from other vital public health needs.\"\n\nThat was in response to the White House attempting to reposition already-approved funds in order to prevent the spread of the virus. Why would the Trump administration do that? Because they fully anticipated that Democrats in the House would play politics with any Trump budget request - even one attempting to save lives. And they were right.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nPelosi's criticisms on this topic are tough to swallow. The House speaker, after all, represents a state where thousands of people live on filthy streets, leading to severe outbreaks of typhoid and bubonic plague, which was known as \"Black Death\" during the Dark Ages. Those were much deadlier diseases than the new virus emanating from China. Her concerns about the health of the nation are apparently episodic.\n\nAttempting to show leadership, Pelosi visited San Francisco's Chinatown and made fortune cookies to demonstrate confidence that the area was safe. However, businesses in that part of her city have suffered a sharp drop of activity. She toured in the dark as Pacific Gas & Electric, the bankrupt utility serving the region was experiencing (routine) power outages. Maybe Pelosi should work on that little issue as well.\n\nSchumer railed about the White House's handling of the virus, saying it showed \"towering and dangerous incompetence.\" He further accused the administration of having \"no plan to deal with the coronavirus ... and seemingly no urgency to develop one.\" Like so many other Schumer claims, this just isn't true.\n\nIn January, Trump convened a task force that included experts such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one of the nation's leading experts on infectious diseases. They immediately restricted incoming visitors from impacted areas, declared a public health emergency and drew down existing funds to put new measures in place.\n\nThe White House is also coordinating a rapid and promising development of vaccines and therapies with the pharmaceutical industry - an industry, by the way, from which Sanders promises to wrest all profits. Someone needs to ask: why would those firms develop new drugs in the future?\n\nDemocratic hopeful Bloomberg charged the president with firing our nation's \"pandemic specialist\" two years ago and said Trump had defunded the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNeither of those charges is true, but when have anti-Trumpers ever let the truth stand in the way of denouncing the president? When has the liberal media, which routinely calls out Trump for misstatements, ever bothered to fact-check their pals on the left?\n\nAs it happens, the \"pandemic expert\" Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, who Trump appointed in 2017 as senior director for Global Health Security and Biodefense at the National Security Council, left as a result of an NSC reorganization undertaken by John Bolton. Today, Ziemer serves as senior deputy assistant administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) at USAID.\n\nAs to defunding the CDC, it is true that the agency's proposed budget has included certain cuts in fiscal 2019 and 2020, as critics have charged. However, in each year the agency has asked for more - not less - funds with which to combat infectious diseases.\n\nAs stated in last year's budget overview: \"The FY 2020 request includes $50.0 million for the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund that was created in FY 2019, bringing the total amount to $100.0 million.\" Another $50 million was added to the funding for \"Global Health Security\" and $50 million more dedicated to the agency's \"Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund.\"\n\nDoes that sound like a group ignoring this issue?\n\nDemocrats and liberal media types have no idea what level of funding will be needed to combat this new virus. Schumer blasted the president for requesting only $2.5 billion in new funds, saying that the correct number was $3.1 billion. A day later, Schumer ratcheted his request up to $8.5 billion with zero explanation.\n\nSchumer's attacks on the Trump White House have become ever more vitriolic and abhorrent. What is most reprehensible is that he and other Democrats appear eager to see this go badly. What does that say about the moral character of these people?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSadly, mistakes will be made, and it may be that some people in the U.S., as elsewhere, will die. But this is a moment for the entire country to come together and work for the public good. Name-calling and blame-shifting are unacceptable.\n\nI am confident that we can beat the virus. I wonder, though, if our political leaders are capable in this era of working for the public good.

More than 95 percent reportedly entered the country over the southwestern border between October 1, 2019 and January 31, 2020.\n\nThis week Acting Chief Patrol Agent of the Rio Grande Vally Sector Austin Skero said that there was a marked increase in the number of Chinese nationals they had apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\n\"During the peak of the humanitarian crisis, we were apprehending around three Chinese nationals per day. This year we are seeing approximately five per day,\" he told KGBT-TV, also promising that there are measures in place to identify individuals with signs of illness who may be potentially infected with a communicable disease.\"\n\nThere are zero cases of coronavirus in the Rio Grande Valley and Northern Mexico to date.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"So, while we have closed and controlled the doorways at our ports of entry, we have got this wide-open doorway on our southern border which leaves us exposed to pandemics like this,\" Kobach warned. \"So, as someone who has been fighting for border control for a long time, I say: 'Hey, don't forget we still have that wide open back door.\"\n\nAlthough the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, coronavirus has not yet been declared a pandemic.\n\nMore than 85,000 have fallen sick -- with most recorded cases in China -- but, thus far, there are only 62 confirmed cases in the
