The campaign has been placing these orders anonymously, but Fox News learned about the effort -- and sources confirmed it.\n\nTRUMP CALLS FOR SENDING VENTILATORS DIRECTLY TO HOSPITALS\n\nOne source told Fox News that the campaign was looking to not only express gratitude for first responders treating patients with COVID-19, but to support local restaurants.\n\n\"They're doing it as a donor who cares,\" one source told Fox News. \"So nothing politically is tied to it. ... We're just trying to, you know, show a thank you.\"\n\n\"They're trying to send things that are like, local restaurants that may need support [and] cool restaurant icons of the area that may need the business,\" one source said.\n\nThe source told Fox News that the campaign has already spent tens of thousands of dollars on the effort, which they plan to expand in the coming days and weeks.\n\nFox News confirmed that as part of the donations, an anonymous individual placed a large order at Giovanni's Italian Deli in Secaucus, N.J., to be delivered to Hudson Regional Hospital.\n\n\"They only told us their first name,\" an employee of Giovanni's told Fox News on Thursday. \"They called us, and they had us donate meals for the nurses and doctors -- an assortment of things, 40 platters of pasta, salads, sandwiches.\"\n\nThe employee added: \"We're happy to do it.

That's great. That's really great, thank you.\"\n\nAnd an Instagram post from the Chit Chat Diner said: \"An anonymous donation providing lunch to some hardworking staff at Hackensack Hospital this afternoon. We are so grateful. #njstrong #prayersforeveryone#wewillgetthroughthis #letsallbewell#stayhome #stayhealthy\"\n\nThe campaign plans to continue placing the orders to feed medical personnel, as the

coronavirus deaths as Trump tells Americans to prepare for 'very painful two weeks'", "body": "Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nThe White House coronavirus task force unveiled on Tuesday the extended guidelines to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States as a somber President Trump told Americans to brace for \"a very painful two weeks.\"\n\nThe extension of the social distancing guidelines comes after Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and other public health officials on the White House coronavirus task force warned that even if the U.S. were to continue to do what it was doing -- keeping the economy closed and most Americans in their homes -- the coronavirus could leave 100,000 to 240,000 people in the United States dead and millions infected.\n\nWithout any measures in place to mitigate the contagion's spread, those projections jump to between 1.5 and 2.2 million deaths from COVID-19.\n\n\"It is absolutely critical for the American people to follow the guidelines,\" Trump said during a daily press briefing. \"It's a matter of life and death.\"\n\nThe new \"30 Days to Slow the Spread\" guidelines are an extension of the strategy the White House implemented just over two weeks ago and include guidance on social distancing, working from home, washing hands frequently, and avoiding any unnecessary travel.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN\n\nWhile Trump sought to reassure Americans that the country would ultimately get through the pandemic, he declined to sugarcoat the severity of the pandemic and said that the battle against the contagion will be worse in the upcoming weeks.\n\n\"This is going to be a rough two week period,\" Trump said. \"As a nation we're going to have a really rough two weeks. Our strength will be tested and our endurance will be tried.\"\n\nAt another point, Trump said: \"This could be a hell of a bad two weeks. This is going to be a very bad two or maybe even three weeks. This is going to be three weeks like we've never seen before.\"\n\nThe change in tone marks an abrupt shift by Trump, who spent much of last week targeting April 12 as the day he wanted to see the country open and \"raring to go\" by Easter Sunday.\n\nFauci and Dr. Deborah Birx the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said that the modeling of 100,000 to 240,000 deaths is still very possible, but Fauci said the federal government is working \"very hard to bring that number down.\" Birx added that the number of deaths could be blunted through proper medical care and social distancing.\n\nThe models predictions have the surge in deaths going into the summer.\n\n\"There's no magic bullet, there's no magic vaccine or therapy. It's just behaviors,\" Birx said, adding that it would be those behaviors that could change \"the course of the viral pandemic.\"\n\nCLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\n\"As sobering a number as that it is, we should be prepared for that,\" Fauci said. \"No one is denying that we are going through a very difficult time right now.\"\n\nMany states and local governments already have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings. One that has not is Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis has held back on implementing lockdown orders in all but the hardest-hit counties.\n\nDeSantis has ordered some statewide measures, such as closing bars, gyms, state parks and limiting restaurants. He is also making anyone arriving from New York, New Jersey or Connecticut within the past three weeks to self-quarantine.\n\nBoth Trump and Vice President Mike Pence said that they are deferring to state and local health officials when it comes to instituting mandatory stay-at-home orders. The president added that DeSantis - a major Trump ally - is doing \"a great job.\"\n\n\"At the president's direction, we will defer to state and local health authorities on any measures they deem necessary,\" Pence said.\n\nThe president also expressed his shock and sadness about the images of bodies being loaded into refrigerated trailers in his hometown of Queens, New York.\n\nA surge in deaths in the epicenter of the crisis in the U.S. has overwhelmed the city's permanent morgues and filled storage spaces in many hospitals to capacity. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is sending 85 refrigerated trucks to serve as temporary morgues, the city said.\n\n\"I watched the doctors and nurses walking into the hospital [in Elmhurst, Queens] this morning and it is like military people going into battle, going into war. The bravery is incredible,\" Trump said of medical workers in the neighborhood where he grew up. \"If I were wearing a hat, I'd rip that hat off so fast and I would say, 'You people are just incredible.'\"\n\nNew York was the nation's deadliest hot spot, with about 1,550 deaths statewide, most of them in New York City, which braced for things to get much worse in the coming weeks. The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus climbed past 3,600 Tuesday, eclipsing China's official count.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, critically ill COVID-19 patients are filling intensive care units, surgical floors and operating rooms and waiting in the emergency room for beds to become available, said Dr. Eric Wei of the city's hospital agency.\n\n\"I've practiced emergency medicine for a long time, and I'm seeing things that I never could have imagined in terms of the things this virus can do to all ages, including people who were previously healthy,\" he said.\n\nA 1,000-bed emergency hospital set up at the mammoth Javits Convention Center began taking non-coronavirus patients to help relieve the city's overwhelmed health system. A Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds that arrived on Monday was expected to begin accepting patients on Tuesday.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

Human Rights Council, where it will help vet candidates for important posts -- despite its decades-long record of systematic human rights abuse that the U.S. has said fueled the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJiang Duan, minister at the Chinese Mission in Geneva, was appointed to the U.N.

Sign up here.\n\nEXCLUSIVE - Multiple patients infected with coronavirus were transferred to the hospital ship Comfort from the Javits Center in New York by mistake, three U.S. officials tell Fox News.\n\nThe number of Covid-19 patients brought on board the hospital ship was estimated to be \"less than five,\" one official said.\n\nThis information has not been previously reported.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe patients were transferred sometime Friday, according to the officials. At the time the patients were transferred to the hospital ship Comfort, the initial screening did not indicate they were positive, officials said.\n\nThe hospital ship is located on Pier 90 on Manhattan's west side and arrived in New York Monday. The vessel has a \"couple dozen\" patients on board right now, according to chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman.\n\nPart of the protocol before receiving patients onboard Comfort is for a coronavirus test to be performed. The swab test came back hours later, but not before the patients had spent a night onboard the vessel, which is only supposed to treat trauma patients, not Covid-19 positive patients.\n\nAbout a dozen patients from the Javits Center in midtown Manhattan were transferred to the hospital ship Comfort Friday after President Trump approved New York Gov. Cuomo's request to have Covid-19 patients treated at the Javits Center Thursday.\n\nAll the patients at Javits Center were then transferred to the hospital ship a short distance away where they were isolated and tested for the novel coronavirus.\n\nUp to the point of embarking aboard the hospital ship, the patients had only filled out a questionnaire and had their temperature taken as part of an initial screening process. It's been reported that half of people infected with coronavirus show no symptoms, according to the latest data.\n\nCUOMO DENIES HE'LL 'SEIZE' VENTILATORS FROM UPSTATE FOR NYC, SAYS ORDER PROMOTES 'SHARING'\n\nThe Covid-19 positive patients have already been delivered back to the Javits center Saturday morning to continue their treatment, one official said.\n\nThe Javits Center has been transformed into a 3,000 bed makeshift hospital by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThe officials called the risk to the hospital ship's crew \"low,\" because of the protocols were already in place.\n\n\"We were prepared with a contingency plan in case we received patients that later tested positive. Immediately upon arrival the patients were isolated while awaiting the test results,\" the official added.\n\nAnother official pointed out this was why the hospital ship did not want to fill all 1,000 beds on board too quickly because the risk of the virus coming on board is so great.\n\nThe Comfort crew is scrubbing the area where the patients were housed on board. All U.S. Navy medical personnel were wearing complete PPE (personal protective equipment), the officials added.\n\n\"We have infectious disease specialists on board as well,\" another official said.\n\nCmdr. Ashley Hockycko, spokeswoman for U.S. Second Fleet, told Fox News: \"While admitting patients who were transferred to USNS Comfort for treatment, a few patients tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"The Comfort has infection control procedures that are followed just like hospitals ashore. Our medical experts on board are well prepared for cases like this, and have taken the appropriate precautionary measures. The patients were isolated and received care aboard the ship while working to transfer the patients as soon as practical to the Javits Federal Medical Station, which is treating COVID-19 patients. The Comfort is capable of continuing its mission.\"\n\nRight now both hospital ships Comfort in New York and Mercy in Los Angeles do not take Covid-19 patients, but top Pentagon leaders are \"reassessing\" that policy, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Mark Milley, told Fox News' Harris Faulkner Friday afternoon.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat decision is \"not imminent,\" a Pentagon spokesman later said in a press conference Friday.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_tomlinson@foxnews.com", "name": "Lucas Tomlinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hospital ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javits_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Javits Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Comfort_(T-AH-20)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USNS Comfort (T-AH-20)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(diplomacy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protocol (diplomacy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_ventilator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical ventilator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Corps of Engineers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_swab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotton swab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal protective equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_A._Milley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark A.

Sign up here.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is pushing for a new stimulus bill that would roll back the state and local tax deduction (SALT), a measure that would predominately help wealthy individuals making more than $100,000 -- including most residents in Pelosi's district and perhaps even Pelosi herself.\n\nThe top Democrat specifically declared this week it might be wise to \"retroactively undo SALT,\" which was enacted as part of the 2017 tax cuts and prevents households from deducting more than $10,000 per year of their state and local tax expenditures from federal tax bills. A Pelosi spokesperson said that a SALT drawdown would be \"tailored to focus on middle-class earners and include limitations on the higher end.\"\n\nIt was unclear exactly what those limitations would be in the proposed SALT shakeup. House Democrats voted last year to largely remove the SALT cap entirely, and haven't hidden their desires to try again should control of the Senate change in November. The cap has been particularly unpopular in high-tax blue states.\n\nRoughly 13 million households nationally would benefit from slashing SALT, with the vast majority of them earning six-figure incomes and located in New York and California, The New York Times reported this week. Even a limited SALT reduction would predominately benefit wealthier Americans.\n\nCalifornia's 12th congressional district, which Pelosi represents, is among the wealthiest in the U.S., with a median income of $113,919, according to census data. The average household income is $168,456 -- meaning most residents would benefit from any significant cut to SALT.\n\nPelosi and her husband have a property tax liability of approximately $198,337.62 considering their two homes, a winery and two commercial properties, public records show, indicating that the couple could reap benefits on roughly $188,000 given a full SALT repeal.\n\nPelosi's 2020 property taxes in Washington, D.C. totaled $13,997.20 given her Georgetown condo and garage, valued at $1,646,730.\n\nHer San Francisco property taxes totaled $51,480.02, plus $47,631.98 from her Napa winery, $64,874.66 from a San Francisco commercial property, and $20,353.76 for another building.\n\nPelosi's idea comes as House and Senate Republicans have sought to claw back the $25 million that the previous stimulus bill allocated to an arts center in Washington, D.C. The payout, which Republicans said was an example of wasteful spending, was at Pelosi's request, and President Trump called it a necessary compromise to win over Democratic support for the coronavirus relief package.\n\nRep. Bryan Steil, R-Wisconsin - who on Tuesday introduced the bill to retract the funding, along with numerous cosponsors, including Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La. - said the bailout was always a \"mistake.\" Recent reports of furloughs and layoffs at the Kennedy Center only made matters worse, the Republicans said.\n\n\"If we determine that another measure is necessary, it should not be the vehicle for Speaker Pelosi's partisan, parochial wish list.\"\n\n-- Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, R-Penn.\n\n\"Families and workers are struggling to pay rent, pay their mortgage and buy groceries,\" Steil said in a statement. \"Americans need relief and assistance now, which is why I supported the CARES Act. However, some in Washington felt it was important to spend $25 million of taxpayer dollars on the Kennedy Center when there are obviously bigger needs right now. This is frivolous spending in the midst of a national emergency.\"\n\nGOP SEEKS TO CLAW BACK $25M ALLOCATED TO KENNEDY CENTER, AS OPERA HOUSE ANNOUNCES LAYOFFS\n\nA 2019 report from the Joint Committee on Taxation projected that of those who would face lower tax liability from elimination of the cap - which only affects those who itemize tax deductions - 94 percent earn at least $100,000. The government would lose out on $77.4 billion in tax dollars, with more than half of that amount being saved by taxpayers earning $1 million or more. Those earning more than $200,000 would reap most of the balance.\n\n\"The ink is hardly dry on a $2 trillion-plus emergency package,\" Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, R-Penn., told the Times. \"It's far too soon to know whether and of what nature additional legislation is needed. If we determine that another measure is necessary, it should not be the vehicle for Speaker Pelosi's partisan, parochial wish list.\"\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has echoed that complaint.\n\n\"This is a nonstarter. Millionaires don't need a new tax break as the federal government spends trillions of dollars to fight a pandemic,\" a spokesperson for Grassley said.\n\nNew York, New Jersey, Maryland and Connecticut even sued to repeal the SALT cap, claiming that it unfairly hit blue states. That lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge, and the states are appealing. The SALT cap is set to expire in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregg_re@foxnews.com", "name": "Gregg Re", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strategic Arms Limitation Talks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Steil", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Steil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California's_12th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California's 12th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Household income in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgetown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Sign up here.\n\nPresident Trump on Friday announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending Americans wear facial coverings made of cloth while out in public to help stop the spread of coronavirus -- though the president repeatedly called it \"voluntary\" and said he wouldn't do it himself.\n\nThe change in guidelines signals a major shift in how officials are looking to combat the spread of COVID-19. The president, during a briefing with the White House coronavirus task force, said the recommendation is being made because of studies indicating asymptomatic people are spreading the virus.\n\n\"In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face coverings as an additional voluntary public health measure,\" Trump said. \"So it's voluntary. You don't have to do it.\"\n\nThe president added: \"I don't think I'm going to be doing it.\" He said he can't imagine himself sitting in the Oval Office of the White House behind \"that beautiful Resolute Desk\" wearing a mask.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nFor weeks, the general public was advised by both the Trump administration and the CDC as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) that only those who were ill or had underlying health issues should wear face masks, and that the surgical masks and N95 protective gear should be reserved for health care workers.\n\nBut Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, said during the briefing they've evolved on the issue because of the number of asymptomatic people who may be spreading coronavirus. He pleaded with Americans who are not sick to leave the N95 and surgical masks for medical professionals and instead make homemade cloth coverings if they decide to use them.\n\nAlso during the press conference, Trump announced that the federal government will reimburse hospitals for treating people who don't have insurance if they become sick from coronavirus. The president opened the briefing by emphasizing how New York City, Louisiana, Michigan and New Jersey are among the hardest-hit places in the United States.\n\nThe announcements came as the White House is taking new steps to protect the president and vice president: it said those who come into close proximity to Trump or Vice President Pence will be required to take a rapid COVID-19 test. The required tests, the White House said, began Friday for anyone working with the president or vice president in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThe new testing guidelines will only apply to people who will be in close contact with the president. This would include some staff members, as well as people who might be sitting beside him at a meeting.\n\nThe CDC move recommending all Americans wear mask when outside comes after some local officials advised their residents to wear either homemade masks or face coverings while out for essential travel.\n\n\"Because of some recent information that the virus can actually be spread even when people just speak as opposed to coughing and sneezing - the better part of valor is that when you're out, when you can't maintain that 6-foot distance, to wear some sort of facial covering,\" task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said while appearing on \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday.\n\nFauci said the new guidelines do not aim to take away the availability of such supplies for frontline workers, who have been making public pleas for more personal protective equipment as governors scramble to secure supplies. He also said that wearing a face covering does not mean Americans should ignore the federal social distancing guidelines that people should stay six feet away from each other when out.\n\n\"The important point to emphasize though is that that should in no way ever take away from the availability of masks that are needed for the health care providers who are in real and present danger of getting infected from the people that they are taking care of,\" Fauci said of the expected guidance. \"This is an addendum and in addition to the physical separation, not as a substitute for it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe debate over face masks has raged for several weeks, with some officials arguing that advising the public to wear coverings would create a false sense of security that would in turn see people abandon social distancing and thorough handwashing.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., for paying attention to the severity of the outbreak at a time when the Senate as a whole was occupied.\n\nMCCONNELL ADMONISHES PELOSI OVER CORONAVIRUS AID BILL: 'I WISH SHE'D TURN OFF THOSE POLITICAL TALKING POINTS'\n\n\"He was first, and I think Tom was right on the mark.

But Tom figured this out early, and he was absolutely right.\"\n\nFormer McConnell aide John Ashbrook also pointed this out Tuesday, stating that the pandemic is believed to have hit the United States the same day that House Democrats marched articles of impeachment to the Senate after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held off on moving forward on impeachment for weeks.\n\nMcConnell also criticized Pelosi for her role during Congress' response to the health and economic problems stemming from the outbreak, particularly the recent $2 trillion stimulus package.\n\n\"The way I thought it would work best would be for those of us in the Senate to try to get started on a bipartisan basis, and we were doing really quite well, as you may recall, until the speaker of the House decided to insert herself into the process, which created a couple of days of unnecessary partisan sniping,\" McConnell said. \"But we got past that. And in the end, I think the best evidence is that there was not a single vote against it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Senate majority leader took another dig at Pelosi for playing partisan politics at a time that both parties had been working together for a common goal, noting how soon this took place after a partisan impeachment process.\n\n\"I think you know, what really is noteworthy about this is we pivoted from the most partisan thing you could possibly be involved in, the impeachment of a president, to a unanimous vote on a $2 trillion dollar package all within a couple of months,\" he said. \"So we did have an outbreak of, you know, kind of the old-fashioned impeachment partisanship, which I think was generated by the speaker trying to, you know, get into the Senate process.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ronn_blitzer@foxnews.com", "name": "Ronn Blitzer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cotton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Ashbrook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John M.

Sign up here.\n\nDr. Stephen Smith, founder of The Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health, said on \"The Ingraham Angle\" on Wednesday night that he is optimistic about the use of antimalarial medications and antibiotics to treat COVID-19 patients, calling it \"a game-changer.\"\n\n\"I think this is the beginning of the end of the pandemic. I'm very serious,\" Smith, an infectious disease specialist, told host Laura Ingraham.\n\nCurrently there is no known cure for the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the globe.\n\nSmith, who is treating 72 COVID-19 patients, said that he has been treating \"everybody with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin [an antibiotic]. We've been doing so for a while.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nHe pointed out that not a single COVID-19 patient of his that has been on the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin regimen for five days or more has had to be intubated.\n\n\"The chance of that occurring by chance, according to my sons Leon and Hunter who did some stats for me, are .000-something,\" he said, adding that \"it's ridiculously low.\"\n\nSmith explained that \"intubation means actually putting a tube down into your trachea and then you're placed on the ventilator for respiratory support.\"\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration recently announced an emergency-use authorization for several drugs, including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, despite a lack of clear evidence of their effectiveness.\n\nA study published earlier this month by French researchers suggested that COVID-19 patients could be treated with antimalarial medication and antibiotics in the battle against the novel coronavirus.\n\nSmith noted on Wednesday that he thinks his data supports the French study.\n\n\"Now you actually have an intra-cohort comparison saying that this regimen works,\" he told Ingraham.\n\nSpeaking on \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday, Dr. Mehmet Oz brought up an \"important randomized study still unpublished from Wuhan, China.\"\n\nHe said that his team spoke to the medical leadership in China and vetted the study.\n\n\"We think it's real,\" Dr. Oz said on Thursday.\n\nHe then went on to explain what the study, which looked at 62 patients, showed. He noted that half of the patients got the traditional therapy being offered in China and the other half got the traditional therapy plus hydroxychloroquine.\n\nCORONAVIRUS CASES STATE BY STATE TOTALS\n\n\"In terms of symptoms, their temperatures, their fevers broke instead of three days, which is the norm over there on this treatment, they got two days,\" Dr. Oz said.\n\nHe added that \"in terms of coughing, the other big symptom you have, again it takes a little over three days oftentimes for that to go away and that was dropped at two days.\"\n\nDr. Oz then pointed out the part that \"really caught my attention.\"\n\n\"They did CT scans of the chest in all the patients. All the patients had pneumonia when they started. Over the course of the five-day treatment with the hydroxychloroquine and 55 percent of the control population where they just got the normal therapy there was resolve and resolution of the pneumonia in 81 percent of the patients on the hydroxychloroquine, there was improvement in the lung's images,\" he pointed out.\n\nDr. Oz noted that these results are \"statistically significant.\"\n\nHe went on to say that even though the study only monitored a small group of people, \"they still got the measures that we like to see.\"\n\nDr. Oz acknowledged that a bigger clinical trial is still needed, adding that the Chinese study \"is an early effort to try to show a lot of people whether this is the right way or the wrong way to go.\"\n\n\"I should point out in the 31 patients that were the control group, four patients had bad outcomes, they got significantly worse. None of the patients in the hydroxychloroquine group got significantly worse,\" he said.\n\n\"So the Chinese are using this as part of their routine treatment. They have a national protocol for measuring COVID-19. I think we ought to consider something like that in this country, but at least physicians and patients should be able to discuss this a bit more comfortably until we have the bigger randomized data from studies done in this country.\"\n\nA new study in the United States, which will be conducted by the University of Washington in conjunction with New York University, looks to enroll 2,000 people who are \"close contacts of persons with confirmed or pending COVID-19 diagnoses,\" according to a statement announcing the study.\n\nNew York State recently said it would start coronavirus drug trials in an attempt to control the pandemic's impact on the state, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who announced the state had acquired 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, 10,000 doses of the antibiotic Zithromax and 750,000 doses of chloroquine, another antimalarial drug.\n\nRecently President Trump has spoken out about the potential promise of hydroxychloroquine to help treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nA New York Times article published on Wednesday also referenced the Chinese study Dr. Oz had referred to on \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\nThe article, which cited doctors in China, titled \"Malaria Drug Helps Virus Patients Improve, in Small Study,\" highlighted the fact that hydroxychloroquine \"helped to speed the recovery of a small number of patients who were mildly ill from the coronavirus.\"\n\n\"Cough, fever and pneumonia went away faster, and the disease seemed less likely to turn severe in people who received hydroxychloroquine than in a comparison group not given the drug,\" the article said. \"The authors of the report said that the medication was promising, but that more research was needed to clarify how it might work in treating coronavirus disease and to determine the best way to use it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSpeaking on \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday Dr. Oz also noted another observation the Chinese made in their study, saying they noticed that people who were already taking hydroxychloroquine, like the people who suffer from the autoimmune disease lupus and are prescribed the drug for that condition, didn't contract COVID-19.\n\n\"So we ought to think about looking at it for doctors and nurses and loved ones

And it's not any time for witch hunts.\"\n\nSpeaking of the virus, Trump said: \"It's time to get this enemy defeated.

And we want to fight for American lives, not waste time and build up my poll numbers, because that's all they're doing, because everyone knows it's ridiculous.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., compared the current pandemic to Pearl Harbor and the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and called for a comprehensive probe.\n\nTRUMP TESTS NEGATIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS A 2ND TIME, WHITE HOUSE SAYS\n\n\"After Pearl Harbor and 9/11, we looked at what went wrong to learn from our mistakes. Once we've recovered, we need a nonpartisan commission to review our response and how we can better prepare for the next pandemic. I'm working on a bill to do that.\"\n\nUnlike the 9/11-style after-action committee that Schiff and others have proposed, Pelosi said the committee she formed Thursday is designed to address the \"here and now\" -- specifically concerning the allocation of the historic amount of federal funds directed to economic recovery.\n\nPelosi compared the new committee to the Senate bipartisan committee chaired by then-Sen. Harry Truman in 1941 to investigate waste, fraud and abuse in defense spending in the early days of World War II.\n\n\"With over $2 trillion in emergency relief, we need to ensure those dollars are spent carefully and effectively,\" Pelosi said of the massive stimulus bill Congress already passed to address the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSCHIFF ALREADY CALLING FOR 9/11-STYLE COMMISSION ON CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE; NUNES DECRIES 'STUNT'\n\nDemocrats' allegation that the White House dawdled in the face of crisis came as Republicans pointed out that in January, when the Trump administration blocked travel from China and formed a coronavirus task force, Democrats were leading his impeachment.\n\nU.S. intelligence reports in January and February warned of a likely pandemic, The Washington Post reported recently.\n\nAccording to the Post: \"Intelligence agencies 'have been warning on this since January,' said a U.S. official who had access to intelligence reporting that was disseminated to members of Congress and their staffs as well as to officials in the Trump administration, and who, along with others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive information.\"\n\nDespite that apparent warning, Schiff's intelligence panel was focused elsewhere. Schiff's Twitter feed did not mention the virus at all until Feb. 24, 2020, and Schiff's House Office press releases didn't mention it until March 15, 2020.\n\nInstead, Schiff was almost exclusively focused on hiring staff to handle impeachment.\n\nFox News' Marisa Schultz contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregg_re@foxnews.com", "name": "Gregg Re", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Permanent_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pearl Harbor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

Devin Nunes accusing him of a \"dumb stunt.\"\n\n\"His Russia collusion hoax failed, his Ukraine scam failed, and his efforts to cover up FISA abuse failed,\" Nunes, R-Calif., told Fox News on Wednesday. \"So, Schiff is launching yet another dumb stunt to justify his never-ending media relations operation.\"\n\nThe intelligence committee chairman has led multiple Trump-focused probes, including the House impeachment inquiry and investigations into whether members of the president's campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election, the president's financial transactions, and more.\n\nSchiff also shared an opinion column written by The Washington Post's David Ignatius, titled \"The U.S. needs to know what went wrong.\"\n\nAccording to the column, Schiff and his staff have \"already started\" working on a commission modeled on the one created after 9/11 and will be \"talking about the possibility with others in Congress.\"\n\nThe column also said that Schiff \"has begun reviewing the committee's intelligence materials on the pandemic.\"\n\n\"We will need to delay the work of the commission until the crisis has abated to ensure that it does not interfere with the agencies that are leading the response,\" Schiff reportedly told Ignatius. \"But that should not prevent us from beginning to identify where we got it wrong and how we can be prepared for the next pandemic.\"\n\nAs of midday Wednesday, the U.S. reported more than 203,000 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 4,360 deaths.\n\nSchiff, in recent days, has slammed Trump, saying: \"You cannot count on Donald Trump to do what's right for this country.\"\n\n\"You can count on him to do what's right for Donald Trump,\" Schiff tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and the White House coronavirus task force have pleaded with Americans to abide by the administration's extended social distancing guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThis week, the president himself told Americans to brace for \"a very painful two weeks and warned of thousands more virus-related deaths.\n\n\"The surge is coming, and it's coming pretty strong,\" Trump said Tuesday night, in a change of tone from previous press briefings.\n\n\"This is going to be a rough two-week period,\" Trump said. \"As a nation, we're going to have a really rough two weeks. Our strength will be tested and our endurance will be tried.\"\n\nThe extension of the social distancing guidelines comes after Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and other public health officials ominously warned that even if the U.S. were to continue to do what it was doing -- keeping the economy closed and most Americans in their homes -- the coronavirus could still leave 100,000 to 240,000 people in the United States dead and millions infected.\n\nWithout any measures in place to mitigate the contagion's spread, those projections jump to between 1.5 and 2.2 million deaths from COVID-19.\n\n\"It is absolutely critical for the American people to follow the guidelines,\" Trump said during the briefing. \"It's a matter of life and death.\"\n\nThe new \"30 Days to Slow the Spread\" guidelines -- unveiled at the press conference -- are an extension of the strategy the White House implemented just over two weeks ago and include guidance on social distancing, working from home, washing hands frequently and avoiding any unnecessary travel.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brooke_singman@foxnews.com", "name": "Brooke Singman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Permanent_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Nunes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Devin Nunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_inquiry_against_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment of Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hoax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pearl Harbor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

approve 'off label' use of Chloroquine medication\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nAfter repeatedly mocking President Trump for suggesting on March 19 that hydroxychloroquine could be an effective treatment for coronavirus, media organizations have begun acknowledging that the drug -- now approved for emergency use to treat coronavirus by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -- may be useful after all.\n\nJournalists and top Democrats have beaten a similarly hasty retreat from their previous claims that Trump's ban on travel from China was both xenophobic and ineffective. But media outlets' misinformation on hydroxychloroquine was unique because it involved not simply policy disagreements but also suggestive medical advice and directives that could have dissuaded some from seeking certain treatments.\n\n\"Malaria Drug Helps Virus Patients Improve, in Small Study,\" The New York Times reported this week, reporting: \"A group of moderately ill people were given hydroxychloroquine, which appeared to ease their symptoms quickly, but more research is needed.\"\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, went from threatening doctors who prescribed the drug with \"administrative action\" to requesting that the federal government ship her state some. Other state leaders have followed suit, including Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat.\n\nIt wasn't always considered acceptable to use that kind of optimistic rhetoric, however.\n\n\"Trump peddles unsubstantiated hope in dark times,\" read a March 20 \"analysis\" by CNN's Stephen Collinson. Saying Trump was \"adopting the audacity of false hope\" and embracing \"premature optimism,\" Collinson charged that \"there's no doubt he overhyped the immediate prospects for the drug\" because the FDA refused to give a timeline on approving the drug to treat coronavirus.\n\n\"Trump is giving people false hope of coronavirus cures. It's all snake oil,\" read one Washington Post headline. Added the Post's editorial board: \"Trump is spreading false hope for a virus cure -- and that's not the only damage.\"\n\n\"The most promising answer to the pandemic will be a vaccine, and researchers are racing to develop one,\" the paper insisted, although it is not staffed with medical experts. \"Mr. Trump's inappropriate hype has already led to hoarding of hydroxychloroquine and diverted supplies from people with other maladies who need it. His comments are raising false hopes. Rather than roll the dice on an unproven therapy, let's deposit our trust in the scientists.\"\n\nUSA Today's editorial board was similarly aggressive and mocking, writing, \"Coronavirus treatment: Dr. Donald Trump peddles snake oil and false hope.\"\n\nFISHY: WOMAN WHO SAID SHE DRANK FISH TANK CLEANER BECAUSE OF TRUMP ACTUALLY HATES TRUMP\n\n\"There are no approved therapies or drugs to treat COVID-19 yet, but the president hypes preliminary chloroquine trials at White House briefing and unproven remedies on Twitter,\" the paper wrote, just days before the FDA would approve the drug.\n\nCommunications strategist Drew Holden flagged these and numerous other examples of media misinformation on the matter in a lengthy Twitter thread.\n\nSalon, Holden noted, called Trump's hope in the new treatment his \"most dangerous flim-flam: False hope and quack advice.\"\n\nThe New Yorker pondered \"The Meaning of Donald Trump's Coronavirus Quackery,\" observing that Trump's \"pronouncements are a reminder, if one was needed, of his scorn for rigorous science, even amid the worst pandemic to hit the U.S. in a century.\"\n\nMichael Cohen, a Boston Globe columnist, urged networks to stop airing Trump's coronavirus press briefings because he was spreading \"misinformation\" about a potential cure.\n\nAnd, NBC News complained, \"Trump, promoting unproven drug treatments, insults NBC reporter at coronavirus briefing.\"\n\nThe New York Times' Kurt Eichenwald reported that a \"Louisiana MD\" on the \"front lines of the COVID-19 fight\" had told him that \"Hydroxychloroquine doesn't work\" and that \"amateurs who dont [sic] understand research\" were driving up demand for the drug. (\"Count me skeptical of your source here, Kurt,\" Holden wrote.)\n\nVox mocked Trump's \"new favorite treatment\" for the drug, and said the evidence is \"lacking\" that it works.\n\nMeanwhile, it has emerged that the Arizona woman who said she and her husband drank fish-tank cleaner to ward off coronavirus has donated heavily to Democrats and acknowledges she's not a Trump supporter -- despite news reports that she ingested the dangerous drug because she trusted what she thought was the president's advice.\n\nThe 61-year-old woman, whose first name is Wanda but has asked for her full identity to be withheld, survived the ordeal. Her 68-year-old husband, Gary, did not. Wanda has said that she and her husband each took a \"teaspoon\" of the fish-tank cleaner; medical toxicology results and a police investigation were pending.\n\n\"I saw it sitting on the back shelf and thought, 'Hey, isn't that the stuff they're talking about on TV?'\" Wanda told NBC News, referring to the chloroquine phosphate in her fish-tank cleaner.\n\nDEMS CALL CHINA TRAVEL BAN XENOPHOBIC, NOW CHANGE THEIR TUNE\n\nOn March 19, Trump had touted anecdotal evidence that the antimalarial drug chloroquine could be used as a treatment for coronavirus during a White House briefing, calling it a possible \"game-changer.\" In fact, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug on an emergency basis, even though various media reports had mocked Trump's suggestion.\n\nHowever, the woman and her husband ingested the additive chloroquine phosphate, which has been used in aquariums to kill microscopic organisms that might harm fish and other aquatic animals.\n\nSeveral media organizations that confused the chloroquine medication with chloroquine phosphate later issued corrections. The New York Times, though, all but accused Trump of recommending the same substance in the fish-tank cleaner.\n\nNevertheless, Wanda drew national attention by claiming that Trump had suggested she consume the fish-tank cleaner with her husband, and that she did so to avoid \"getting sick.\"\n\n\"My advice is don't believe anything that the president says and his people because they don't know what they're talking about,\" Wanda told NBC News' Vaughn Hillyard.\n\nWHAT IS CHLOROQUINE?\n\nFederal Election Commission (FEC) records reviewed by the outlet revealed numerous other recipients of Wanda's cash, including Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the pro-choice EMILY's List.\n\nAdditionally, Fox News has reviewed a Facebook page apparently belonging to Wanda, which was first identified by the Twitter user Techno Fog.\n\n\"Your psycho prez is in [t]own, are you going to see him?\" Wanda wrote on Facebook on Feb. 19, by way of wishing a friend a happy birthday. Trump was in town at a rally in Phoenix, Ariz., on that day.\n\nWanda has not replied to multiple requests for comment by Fox News. She deleted her Facebook page after Fox News attempted to contact her there.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregg_re@foxnews.com",

Gretchen Whitmer's administration has requested an emergency supply of the drugs President Trump touted as having success treating patients with severe symptoms of the novel coronavirus, in a reversal from the state's directive to medical professionals last week to avoid the medication for this purpose.\n\nMichigan, this week, requested hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile for physicians to use to help treat patients with COVID-19, after the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend granted an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs.\n\nFDA OKs EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION OF DRUGS TOUTED BY TRUMP TO FIGHT COVID-19\n\nBut last week, Whitmer's administration threatened physicians prescribing the drugs, saying they were subject to \"administrative action\" should they continue to use the medication.\n\n\"The Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs has received multiple allegations of Michigan physicians inappropriately prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to themselves, family, friends, and/or coworkers without a legitimate medical purpose,\" Deb Gagliardi, the director of the Bureau of Professional Licensing, and Forrest Pasanski, the director of the Enforcement Division, wrote in a letter to \"licensed prescribers and dispensers.\"\n\n\"Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage\" for those patients who need the drug for its approved use, adding that \"reports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action.\n\n\"Again, these drugs have not been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19.\"\n\n\"Michigan pharmacists may see an increased volume of prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and should take special care to evaluate the prescriptions' legitimacy,\" they continued, warning again that \"licensed health professionals are required to report inappropriate prescribing practices.\"\n\nMichigan wasn't the only state last week to threaten physicians using the drugs -- Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak's administration also restricted the prescription of the medication, after a man died and his wife was hospitalized for using a fish tank cleaning additive with a similar name as a substitute.\n\n\"While the two drugs have necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada's own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,\" Sisolak said in a statement last week.\n\nBut Michigan reversed course, requesting a supply of the medications for physicians to use in treating patients of COIVD-19, after the Department of Health and Human Services received and accepted donations of the medications to the national stockpile to be used for coronavirus treatment.\n\n\"President Trump is taking every possible step to protect Americans from the coronavirus and provide them with hope,\" HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. \"Scientists in America and around the world have identified multiple potential therapeutics for COVID-19, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.\"\n\nHe added: \"The President's bold leadership and the hard work of FDA and HHS's Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response have succeeded in securing this large donation of medicine. We'll continue working around the clock to get American patients access to therapeutics that may help them battle COVID-19, while building the evidence to evaluate which options are effective.\"\n\nThe FDA's emergency use authorization allows hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the national stockpile \"to be distributed and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible.\"\n\nWHITMER SAYS STATES ARE IN A BIDDING WAR OVER MEDICAL SUPPLIES AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nHydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate are oral prescription drugs approved to treat malaria and other diseases. HHS says there currently are no approved treatments for COVID-19, but that both drugs have \"shown activity in laboratory studies against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).\"\n\n\"Anecdotal reports suggest that these drugs may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients,\" HHS said in a statement. \"Clinical trials are needed to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are effective.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Whitmer, who has been a fierce critic of the president, said last week that states are being forced to bid with one another for personal protective equipment (PPE) and, in some cases, contracts in place have been set aside, delayed or canceled and the goods are instead going to the federal government.\n\n\"We the states are trying to actively get every piece of PPE that we can. We're bidding against one another and, in some cases, the federal government is taking priority,\" she said.\n\nWhitmer added: \"We've got to keep working to get all of these other pieces of equipment and when we're bidding against one another, it's creating a lot of frustration and concern.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the U.S. reported more than 216,700 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than

delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nThe head of Florida's Division of Emergency Management has accused U.S. mask manufacturer 3M of shipping the critical protective equipment to foreign countries who outbid U.S. buyers -- even as hospitals and state officials desperately scramble to secure N95 protective masks for healthcare workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJared Moskowitz told \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" Thursday that he discovered that 3M distributors were prioritizing foreign buyers after they refused to sell him the essential equipment.\n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK STATE BY STATE\n\n\" The idea that an American company is selling masks away from our hospitals...doctors...the real heroes on the front lines is... really criminal.\"\n\n-- Jared Moskowitz\n\n\"For the last several weeks, we have had a boiler room chasing down 3M authorized distributors [and] brokers representing that they sell the N95 masks, only get to warehouses that are completely empty,\" Moskowitz said. \"[We are] being told that our shipments are on cargo planes and the flights don't even appear. We are chasing ghosts. I just decided to turn up the heat and tell people what is actually happening in the N95 mask space.\"\n\nMoskowitz claimed to have reached out to many 3M authorized distributors in the United States to confirm his suspicions, and said he was shocked to find American companies quietly partnering with foreign buyers at a time of national crisis.\n\n\"They're specifically saying, 'Listen, we are sorry your order got pushed down, but ... there are foreign countries who do business differently and they're showing up with cash.'\"\n\nMoskowitz said he has a hard time grappling with \"the idea that an American company is selling masks away from our hospitals, away from our doctors ... away from the real heroes on the front lines\" and called for investigations into what he described as \"criminal\" activity.\n\n\"I can't... get this life-saving PPE because a company decided to make a globalist decision and not put America first.\"\n\n-- Jared Moskowitz\n\n\"I can't, other emergency management directors, CEOs of hospitals can't get this life-saving PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] because a company decided to make a globalist decision and not put America first.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nMoskowitz voiced his frustrations on Twitter and said he was later contacted by the communications team at Minnesota-based 3M, who admitted to a \"broken system\" but stopped short of taking action.\n\n\"I thought perhaps maybe what 3M would finally say to me is that they have masks to sell me, but what I actually found out is even more frightening,\" he explained. \"... Which is that the system is completely broken. 3M has lost total control. What I asked 3M is, are they aware they're authorized distributors -- U.S. companies -- are telling me the reason why our orders are being pushed down is because foreign countries are showing up with cash to purchase the orders ... not only did they not dispute it, [but] I asked them if they put out any guidance to prevent the behavior and the answer was no,\" Moskowitz added.\n\n3M told Moskowitz that they had no stock to sell him, despite producing close to 10 million masks a day,\n\n\" I said ... 'I have money and I'd like to purchase some of those.' They said I couldn't, they have no masks to sell me. It's criminal what is happening.\"\n\nMoskowitz emphasized that his criticism is not directed towards the \"workers in the factories at 3M who are working 24 hours a day to try to create this life-saving PPE. This is about the executives who decided not to put America first and it's going to have devastating consequences.\"\n\nThe official said he offered to pay \"ten, sometimes twenty\" times of the standard price of the masks, but was denied.\n\n\"3M is an ice cream store that doesn't sell ice cream.\"\n\n-- Jared Moskowitz\n\n\"3M is an ice cream store that doesn't sell ice cream,\" he explained.\n\n\"Since when do we have a U.S. company that sells masks and I try to offer them money and they don't sell them to me? I have to go through their authorized distributors and their only excuse is that they don't have a perfect system.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"I'm relegated to making deals with brokers at costs that are ten and sometimes 20 times the actual costs of these masks, [but] at the end of the day, regardless of the cost of this point, getting the mask is the most important and we can't even get them.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said his state was on the hunt for N95 masks and called the procurement process \"shady as hell,\" adding that despite ordering \"so many,\" they only get a little bit here and a little bit there.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yael_halon@foxnews.com", "name": "Yael Halon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Division_of_Emergency_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Division of Emergency Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Moskowitz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jared Moskowitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal protective equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Globalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Paintball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Paintball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Mardi_Gras", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Mardi Gras", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Halloween", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/1024/512/image-13.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "eventUri": "eng-5655280", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 8515, "pinterest": 16}, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 8531, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "6021060789", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-05", "time": "14:12:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-05T14:12:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-05T14:12:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/surgeon-general-warns-this-week-will-be-our-pearl-harbor-moment-as-coronavirus-death-toll-rises", "title": "Surgeon General warns this week will be 'our Pearl Harbor moment' as coronavirus death toll rises", "body": "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams joins moderator Martha MacCallum on 'America Is Asking: COVID-19 Crisis.'\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.
