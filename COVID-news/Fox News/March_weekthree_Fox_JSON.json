RICHARD BURR, KELLY LOEFFLER SOLD MILLIONS IN STOCK BEFORE CORONAVIRUS CRIPPLED MARKETS, REPORTS FIND\n\nWhen questioned by the newspaper, a spokesman for the Democrat from San Francisco said Feinstein wasn't directly involved in the sale.\n\n\"All of Senator Feinstein's assets are in a blind trust,\" the spokesman, Tom Mentzer, told the Times. \"She has no involvement in her husband's financial decisions.\"\n\n\"All of Senator Feinstein's assets are in a blind trust. She has no involvement in her husband's financial decisions.\"\n\n-- Tom Mentzer, Feinstein spokesman\n\nReports identified the three other senators as Richard Burr of North Carolina, Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, all Republicans.\n\nBurr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, used more than 30 transactions to dump between $628,000 and $1.72 million on Feb. 13, according to ProPublica.\n\nThe report said the transactions involved a significant percentage of the senator's holdings and took place about a week before the impact of the virus outbreak sent stock prices plunging to the point where gains made during President Trump's term in office were largely erased.\n\n\"Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,\" a Burr spokesperson said. \"As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy.\"\n\nBurr was an author of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, a law that helps determine the federal response to situations such as the coronavirus outbreak, ProPublica reported. Burr's office would not comment on what kind of information Burr might have received about coronavirus prior to his stock sales, the outlet reported.\n\nNPR reported that Burr made more ominous comments about coronavirus behind closed doors last month.\n\n\"There's one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,\" Burr said at a Feb. 27 meeting of business leaders in Washington. \"It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.\"\n\nLoeffler was appointed to the Senate in December by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp after incumbent Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned because of health issues - despite allies of President Trump having urged Kemp to select Rep. Doug Collins instead.\n\nLoeffler and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, sold stock Jan. 24, the same day she sat in on a briefing from two members of Trump's Coronavirus Task Force, The Daily Beast reported.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nBetween that day and Feb. 14, the couple sold stock worth a total between $1.2 million and $3.1 million, the report said. In addition to the sales, they also purchased stock in a maker of software that helps people work at home - just before millions of Americans were forced to leave their offices because of the outbreak, the report said.\n\nLoeffler slammed the Daily Beast report as a \"ridiculous and baseless attack\" in a pair of late-night tweets.\n\n\"This is a ridiculous and baseless attack. I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement,\" Loeffler wrote. \"As confirmed in the periodic transaction report to Senate Ethics, I was informed of these purchases and sales on February 16, 2020 -- three weeks after they were made.\"\n\nImhofe sold as much as $400,000 in stock all on Jan. 27, in companies such as PayPal, Apple and real estate company Brookfield Asset Management, The New York Times reported.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I mean now -- in the next few weeks.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE EYES MASSIVE $850B STIMULUS PACKAGE NEXT, AS SENATE MOVES ON LATEST CORONAVIRUS BILL\n\nAs the White House held its press conference Tuesday -- with President Trump, Vice President Pence, Mnuchin and the coronavirus task force present -- the Dow rallied nearly 1,000 points, after sustaining historic losses on Monday.\n\n\"The president has instructed me we have to do this now,\" Mnuchin added, though did not give specifics, except to say that the amount would be significant and that millionaires would not receive it.\n\nFox News has learned, however, that Mnuchin is pressing GOP senators for a package that would send $200 billion-plus of payments to Americans by early April.\n\nMnuchin's comments came as the White House is in negotiations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Congress to approve a sweeping economic stimulus package to help U.S. businesses and taxpayers deal with the economic fallout from the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nCLICK FOR THE CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES RELEASED BY THE WHITE HOUSE\n\nMnuchin, on Tuesday, also announced that the Treasury Department would not extend the deadline to file taxes by the April 15 deadline, as much of the tax filing can be done online.\n\n\"We encourage Americans who can file taxes to continue to file taxes on April 15 because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don't want you to lose out on those tax refunds,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nMnuchin added that if individuals or corporations owe money to the Internal Revenue Service after filing their taxes, those payments now are able to be deferred for up to 90 days interest-free.\n\n\"If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to $1 million as an individual, and $10 million to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days,\" Mnuchin continued. \"File your taxes, you'll automatically not get charged interests or penalties.\"\n\nMnuchin was planning to outline a nearly $850 billion package during a lunch with Senate Republicans Tuesday, which Trump administration officials hope to have approved by the end of this week.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, opening the Senate on Tuesday morning, promised swift action.\n\n\"The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe Trump administration's stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama, and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began.\n\nTrump, during the press briefing Tuesday, said there was \"great spirit\" among lawmakers with regard to the plan. \"I can say that for Republicans and Democrats.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the president and the coronavirus task force, which is led by Vice President Pence, touted the administration's progress on testing for COVID-19, and announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced new policies to increase testing.\n\n\"We have tremendous testing capacity,\" Trump said.\n\nPence said that testing is now available in all 50 states, and announced that \"state health authorities can now authorize labs in their state and expand existing testing capabilities.\"\n\nPence also said the administration has continued to expand its \"public-private partnership\" with \"vast commercial labs around the country,\" which he said is \"increasing access to coronavirus testing.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This is greatly expanding access, even as we speak,\" Pence said Tuesday.\n\n\"It is important that the American people understand that testing is happening all around the country,\" Pence said, adding that experts \"want me to tell the American people that you don't need the testing to know what you should do.\"\n\n\"Experts say that if every American acts on the coronavirus guidelines, we can see a substantial reduction in the spread, but as the president said, it will take all of us to do it,\" Pence said, noting those guidelines rolled out by the White House and CDC Monday which included social distancing, limiting social gatherings to groups of less than 10 individuals, and staying at home.\n\n\"For the American people, as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low,\" Pence said.\n\nThe president weighed in on the guidelines, adding that he \"would recommend that people enjoy their living rooms,\" and urged young people to do their part.\n\nOne guideline, specifically, states that: \"If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.\"\n\nAnother states: \"If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lungs or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.\"\n\n\"We have to fight that invisible enemy, I guess unknown, but we're getting to know it much better,\" Trump said of the virus. \"We are looking to save a maximum number of lives.\"\n\nThe president also announced that he has been having open conversations with governors across the nation, leaders in the fast-food, pharmaceutical and grocery industries; and will meet with leaders of the tourism industry on Tuesday.\n\nThe president was also asked about his tweets, referring to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese Virus,\" and whether he thought his rhetoric could create a stigma. Trump denied that notion, calling it a \"very accurate phrase,\" and said it was his response to China spreading disinformation about the U.S. military spreading COVID-19.\n\n\"Rather than having an argument, I said, I have to call it where it came from,\" Trump said. \"It did come from China.\"\n\nThe outbreak is believed to have originated at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan, China.\n\n\"We're taking aggressive action now as one nation and one family so that America can rebound stronger frankly, stronger than ever,\" he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization designated COVID-19 a global pandemic last week.\n\nTrump announced a national emergency on Friday. The president also announced a temporary halt on air travel to the United States from Europe, now including flights from the United Kingdom, but excluding those carrying cargo.\n\nWhen asked Tuesday whether he would limit domestic travel, the president replied: \"It's possible.\"\n\nThe coronavirus task force also predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in approximately 45-days.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, there were more than 4,660 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, in 49 states, including Washington, D.C.

"Republican Kentucky senator Rand Paul tests positive for COVID-19 and will remain in quarantine, according to his official Twitter account.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Senate on Sunday failed to move forward with considering the $1.4 trillion \"Phase Three\" stimulus package intended to help businesses and families devastated by the downturn over the coronavirus outbreak, as Democrats signaled their opposition to the plan.\n\nThe vote came while at least five GOP senators were in self-quarantine, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who became the first U.S. Senator to test positive for the virus. Senators were asked to practice social distancing and given a list of health guidelines to follow while entering the chamber.\n\n\"Americans don't need to see us haggling endlessly,\" Senate Majority Leader McConnell, R-Ky., warned earlier if the package wasn't passed.\n\nMany Democrats had complained that the draft aid package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and failed to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion \"slush fund\" for corporations, saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs are weak and the limits on executive pay would last only two years.\n\n\"We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"We're here to help workers, we're here to help hospitals.\"\n\nDemocrats also pushed for add-ons including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers -- saying the three months of unemployment insurance offered under the draft plan was insufficient.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the draft package \"significantly cut back our hospitals, our cities, our states, our medical workers and so many others needed in this crisis.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged colleagues to \"take responsibility\" as Democrats prepared their own draft.\n\nThe urgency to act has been mounting, as jobless claims have risen, many businesses shuttered and the financial markets are set to re-open Monday eager for signs that Washington could soften the blow of the health-care crisis and what experts have warned could be a looming recession.\n\nAt issue: how best to keep paychecks flowing for millions of workers abruptly sidelined by the crisis, shore up businesses and aid hospitals.\n\nWhile congressional leaders worked to send help, alarms were being sounded from coast to coast about the wave of coronavirus cases about to crash onto the nation's health system.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing list of lawmakers have cycled in and out of isolation after exposure, and two members of the House have said they tested positive.\n\nACTING DHS SECRETARY WOLF: NO 'IMMEDIATE' PLANS FOR DOMESTIC TRAVEL BAN AMID CORONAVIRUS\n\nOfficials put the price tag of the rescue package at nearly $1.4 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve it could pump $2 trillion into the U.S. economy.\n\nThere also was a $242 billion proposal for emergency supplemental food, hospital and public health needs, including for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC].\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus has sparked only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it could cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

"US starts to release inmates due to coronavirus outbreak", "body": "New York City will be releasing \"vulnerable\" inmates who have underlying health conditions, including those who were arrested for minor crimes, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday.\n\nHis decision comes as an inmate at Rikers Island in the city tested positive for the virus and eight others are showing symptoms.\n\nRIKERS ISLAND INMATE IS FIRST TO TEST POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS, DE BLASIO ANNOUNCES\n\n\"This inmate was in a housing unit with other inmates, all have been checked for symptoms,\" de Blasio said at a news conference. \"Eight have been identified with symptoms and have been moved also to isolation within the communicable disease unit.\"\n\nDisgraced media mogul Harvey Weinstein will be also be moved from Rikers to a maximum-security prison located just east of Buffalo and next to the Canada border.\n\nOther prisons in New York, including Sing Sing -- located 30 miles north of Manhattan -- have seen inmates test positive for COVID-19, according to the BBC. An employee for the state's corrections department has died from the virus.\n\nOther states to enact measures protecting inmates so far include California, Ohio, and Florida.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., called for \"low-risk\" inmates in California federal prisons to be released from custody, according to a letter sent to Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Director Michael Carvajal on Thursday. Her decision comes after two prisoners in the state are in quarantine after coming in contact with a person who tested positive for coronavirus.\n\n\"In the midst of this crisis, BOP should be taking reasonable steps to reduce the incarcerated population and guard against potential exposure to coronavirus,\" Harris said. \"At this time, BOP -- in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice -- can and should request the release of low-risk individuals who are in pretrial detention because of money bail.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has reduced its inmate population by 600 in the last two weeks, officials said on Tuesday, according to the BBC.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS WANTS 'LOW RISK' INMATES RELEASED AMID FEARS OF COVID-19 SPREADING IN PRISONS\n\n\"Our population within our jails is a vulnerable population just by who they are, where they are located, so we're protecting that population from potential exposure,\" Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters earlier this week.\n\nCuyahoga County in Ohio -- where Cleveland is located -- has also released hundreds of prisoners due to coronavirus concerns.\n\nJudges held emergency hearings through the weekend to settle plea deals, release inmates or send them to prison, or release them on house arrest, according to Cleveland's FOX 8.\n\n\"The goal of this is to protect the community and the safety of the inmates,\" the judge told the station. \"If someone's a serious violent person, well, we're using our discretion to make sure the community's safe also.\"\n\nIn Florida, the sheriff of Hillsborough County -- located in the Tampa Bay area -- announced the release of over 100 \"low-level\" offenders on Thursday. The county saw one of Florida's first two cases back on March 1.\n\nOHIO JAIL TO RELEASE HUNDREDS OF INMATES AMID CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS: REPORTS\n\nSheriff Chad Chronister said 164 inmates will be released to protect the remaining inmate population and employees from the virus.\n\n\"These defendants are the lowest public-safety risk and were merely sitting in jail because they could not afford to pay the amount it would take to bond out,\" he explained during a news conference, according to Tampa's FOX 13. \"These defendants will still have to answer to the charges against them.\"\n\nA reason prisons can be dangerous amid the coronavirus outbreak includes the lack of healthcare supplies, restraints on inmates, and being stuck in close proximity with others.\n\nHandcuffed people usually cannot protect their coughs or sneezes, sinks often lack soap and hand sanitizer is considered contraband due to its alcohol content, the BBC reported.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE CORONAVIRUS

Gavin Newsom on Thursday evening announced he's enacting a \"statewide order\" for its nearly 40 million residents to \"stay at home,\" a wide-reaching order for the most populous state in the country as the coronavirus spreads.\n\nThe order, taking effect Thursday night, prohibited gatherings outside and required businesses that needed employees to physically report to work to shut down.\n\n\"We need to bend the curve in the state of California,\" Newsom said. \"There's a social contract here. People, I think, recognize the need to do more. They will adjust and adapt as they have.\"\n\nHe added, \"This is a moment we need to make tough decisions. This is a moment where we need some straight talk and we need to tell people the truth.\"\n\nPublic events have been canceled and bars, dine-in restaurants, gyms and clubs will be closed. Essential services such as grocery stores, pharmacies and banks will stay open. Newsom's office projected the virus will infect more than half of Californias within two months, according to a letter he sent to President Trump on Wednesday.\n\nThe order came just after Los Angeles County officials announced a near-lockdown of the county, affecting 10 million residents who were urged to stay home except in cases when they needed to go outside for essential needs.\n\n\"We're about to enter into a new way of living here in Los Angeles,\" Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a news conference. \"What we do and how we do it and if we get this right will determine how long this crisis lasts.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Newsom directed $100 million to go toward local governments for emergency housing and shelter support.

The U.K., likewise, has suggested similar measures.\n\nWhen asked Sunday on Sky News about the possibility of releasing prisoners, General Secretary Steve Gillan said: \"There are no plans now to release prisoners but it cannot be ruled out.\"\n\nAmerica's nearly 7,000 jails, prisons and correction facilities pose a fertile breeding ground for the virus, given inadequate health conditions in normal circumstances, as well as the inmates' close proximity to one another. Though no cases have been reported in any of the nation's prisons, advocates of releasing the inmates say prisons represent a ticking time bomb if nothing is done.\n\nCalls for action have only grown louder following the death of David Perez, a New York City Department of Correction investigator, who died this week after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"The only way we can possibly keep incarcerated people safe is to release them,\" said Justine Olderman, executive director of the advocacy group Bronx Defenders. \"The next best thing is to drastically reduce the number of people being held. Neither of those things are being done right now. As public defenders, what we're actually seeing happen is the opposite, and it is terrifying.\"\n\nDR. FAUCI: 'I'M CERTAIN' GUIDELINES TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS ARE HAVING AN IMPACT, BUT NUMBER OF CASES WILL RISE\n\nWhile some cities, including Los Angeles and Cleveland, have begun releasing some inmates, no concerted effort at the federal level has taken place.\n\nOn Friday, the Federal Bureau of Prisons released safety guidelines on managing prisons during the outbreak but stopped short of calling for releasing prisoners.\n\nIn Illinois, state and local officials are considering releasing their most vulnerable detainees, including the elderly and those with the most urgent health care needs, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nLast Thursday, dozens of advocates and attorneys sent a letter to Gov. J.B. Pritzker requesting that he \"consider immediately ordering a review of all people in Illinois prisons and jails who are elderly or infirm, with an eye toward providing medical furloughs or compassionate release to as many of them as possible.\"\n\nAn op-ed written by medical experts and published in The Washington Post Thursday echoed those calls.\n\n\"Authorities should release those who do not pose an immediate danger to public safety, while also reducing arrests and delaying sentencings,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe authors acknowledged that such a move could \"carry inherent political risks\" but stressed that they would be for \"the greater good of the public at large.\"\n\nThe Cook County Sheriff's Office, meanwhile, said it has been calling outside jurisdictions \"for inmates who are held on warrants for non-violent offenses, asking that the warrant be quashed and recalled or geographically limited so that the detainee can be released.\"\n\nSharlyn Grace, executive director of the Chicago Community Bond Fund, applauded the move but said more \"dramatic changes\" are needed.\n\nJennifer Soble, executive director of the Illinois Prison Project, said the crisis is highlighting problems that have existing in the prison system for decades.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on MSNBC, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., likened U.S. prisons to a \"petri dish\" for spreading the coronavirus.\n\n\"This pandemic, COVID-19, has certainly highlighted and exasperated every socio, ratio, and political fault line in our country,\" she said. \"And given the crowding and overpopulating in our prisons for a confluence of other reasons ... are an ecosystem in a petri dish for the spreading of this pandemic.\"\n\nREPS. MARIO DIAZ-BALART, BEN MCADAMS ARE FIRST LAWMAKERS TO ANNOUNCE TESTING POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS\n\nStill, not everyone is on board with the idea of releasing prisoners. The Correction Officers' Benevolent Association has called a temporary release proposal signed Tuesday by 30 prosecutors \"asinine\" and \"irresponsible.\" Instead, the association suggested providing more masks, gloves and hand sanitizers to corrections officers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSpeaking to Fox News Wednesday evening, New York Republican Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis called it \"absolutely disgraceful\" that elected officials would entertain such ideas during a crisis emergency situation. She pointed that under New York's bail law, which took effect in January, 90 percent of the city's incarcerated population is already being released.\n\n\"So, what's left in Rikers Island are suspected murderers, rapists, gang members, heavy drug traffickers, and certainly that's not what we should be releasing back on to our street during this particularly difficult time, or ever,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bradford_betz@foxnews.com", "name": "Bradford Betz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Communist Party of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child.\n\nThe rebate amount is slated to be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer's income exceeds the legislation's threshold. The amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. The IRS will determine income based on U.S. citizen taxpayers' 2018 tax returns.\n\nREAD MCCONNELL'S STIMULUS PROPOSAL\n\nThe legislation additionally contains numerous business-related provisions geared at helping small businesses, including a delay of payment for employer payroll taxes, a delay of estimated tax payments for corporations, and modifications for net operating losses.\n\nMcConnell's plan would provide $208 billion in loans and loan guarantees to distressed sectors of the economy, including $50 billion for commercial airlines and $8 billion for air cargo carriers, and $150 billion for other eligible businesses, but those loans would have to be paid back.\n\nMcConnell, R-Ky., speaking on the Senate floor, said he wanted key Republicans to meet with Democrats on the relief bill, known as S.3548, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Phase III).\n\nIt's an opening salvo in fast-track talks with Democrats as President Trump urges Congress to \"go big\" to respond as Americans reel from the crisis.\n\nREAD REPUBLICANS' SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF THE BILL\n\n\"These are urgent discussions and they need to happen at the member level,\" McConnell said, noting the White House will send key personnel to talk about the bill as they try to forge a compromise.\n\nFox News is told McConnell did not yet have the votes on his side, and had two Republicans self-quarantined.\n\nSpeaking after McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., complained that Republicans had sought \"no input\" from Democrats, and asserted that no Democrats had even seen the bill.\n\nHe added he was told \"there is a bailout for industries\" in the measure.\n\nDemocrats have their own proposals for ushering aid to Americans, and even some of McConnell's GOP senators have said they preferred instead to use the federal dollars to keep workers who are asked to stay home on the business payrolls.\n\n\"What I want is income, not one check,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., summing up the views of some exiting a long, private meeting of GOP senators on Capitol Hill. One or two checks \"makes no sense to me,\" he said.\n\nILHAN OMAR PRAISES TRUMP'S 'INCREDIBLE' CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday morning told Fox Business Network that the White House was looking at payments of $1,000 to most adult Americans within three weeks, as a way to stem the widespread economic damage caused by shuttered businesses and social distancing.\n\nMnuchin also said that if the crisis were still ongoing in six weeks, the federal government would deliver another round of checks worth the same amount of money.\n\nThe Treasury secretary said Thursday the checks would be direct-deposited into people's accounts.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump on Wednesday signed the second coronavirus relief bill into law that provides paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans.\n\nThe legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states.\n\nINSIDE CHINA'S PROPAGANDA PUSH ON CORONAVIRUS\n\nThe House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered.\n\nThough unusual, stimulus checks are not unprecedented.

Many Republicans have said Democrats wouldn't help them meet the 60-vote threshold needed for cloture.\n\n\"There is at this time a big difference between the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act and what the Senate Republicans are proposing,\" Pelosi said. \"As the Senate continues to talk, we must continue to act For The People.\"\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) senior adviser Matt Whitlock said he was outraged by Pelosi's handling of the situation.\n\n\"The Senate canceled recess to work at breakneck speed because people need help now. Pelosi waltzes in after the House has been on a week long vacation and says they're going to do their own thing and the Senate's Monday urgency is arbitrary. Just wild,\" he tweeted.\n\nLater, Whitlock took aim at Pelosi's letter, calling it disingenuous: \"Pelosi's mention of 'their work during the district work period' (AKA recess) is a pretty obvious attempt to draw attention away from the fact that the House was on vacation while the Senate hammered out a bipartisan Coronavirus response bill that she is now trying to tank.\"\n\nRAND PAUL TESTS POSITIVE\n\n\"Can't get over this,\" Whitlock wrote later. \"Members of the House and Senate have the virus.

But, faced with mounting opposition from Democrats who call the package insufficient, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell postponed a planned procedural vote Sunday, resetting it for 6 p.m.\n\n\"Coronavirus has now arrived here in the Senate,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor Sunday evening. \"There are at least five senators in self-quarantine.\"\n\nMcConnell said a planned 6 p.m. ET proceudral vote on a new coronavirus stimulus bill would go ahead. \"We need to signal to the public that we're ready to get this job done,\" he said. \"And the way to do that is to vote aye in five minutes on cloture on the motion to proceed.\"\n\nBut, Democrats have said the package did not go far enough to provide health care and unemployment aid for Americans, and catered too much to big business.\n\nTOP DEM SLAMS DISABLED WOMAN BUYING, TOUTING GUNS: 'SICKENING'\n\nThe urgency to act has been mounting, as jobless claims have risen, businesses have shuttered and the financial markets are set to re-open Monday eager for signs that Washington could soften the blow of the health-care crisis and what experts have warned could be a looming recession.\n\nAt issue: how best to keep paychecks flowing for millions of workers abruptly sidelined by the crisis. Talks also narrowed on plans to aid hospitals and provide loans to airlines and other industries all but grounded by the national shutdown. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, said Sunday the auto industry also likely would need government assistance.\n\nOfficials put the price tag at nearly $1.4 trillion and said that with other measures from the Federal Reserve, it could pump $2 trillion into the U.S. economy.\n\nMnuchin said Sunday that workers and businesses will get assistance to help cover payrolls for the next 10 weeks; unemployment insurance; and a one-time \"bridge payment\" of about $3,000 for a family of four.\n\nThe treasury secretary said a significant part of the package will involve working with the Federal Reserve for up to $4 trillion of liquidity to support the economy with \"broad-based lending programs.\"\n\nHospitals, Mnuchin said, will get approximately $110 billion for the expected influx of sick patients.\n\nBut, Democrats have pushed for add-ons including food security aid, small business loans and other measures for workers -- including jobless aid for those in the so-called \"gig\" economy not traditionally eligible for unemployment checks.\n\nA senior aide for the Democrats, unauthorized to discuss the talks and speaking on condition of anonymity, said the package provided only three months of unemployment benefits, did not provide eviction protections and would a $500 billion \"corporate slush fund\" that did not institute enough restraints on how big business would spend the money.\n\nThere also has been a $242 billion proposal for emergency supplemental food, hospital and public health needs, including for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC].\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump has said companies should not be able to use federal assistance to buy back stock in an effort to increase profits.

headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease doctor, said President Trump and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were not to blame for a lack of coronavirus testing kits that has prompted criticism of the administration as cases continue to grow in the United States.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Hugh Hewitt Show\" on Tuesday, Fauci -- also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- was asked about the slow rollout of test kits, saying the delay was due to a \"technical glitch\" that slowed things down and a series of \"multiple things that conflated.\"\n\n\"There [weren't] any bad guys there. It just happened,\" Fauci said. \"And then when we realized, when the CDC realized, and the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] said both the system itself as it was set up, which serves certain circumstances very well, was not well-suited to the kind of broad testing that we needed the private sector to get involved in.\"\n\n\"Was the glitch or anything about the production of the test President Trump's fault?\" Hewitt asked. \" Or actually, let me put it more broadly, would every president have run into the same problem?\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely. This has nothing to do with anybody's fault, certainly not the president's fault,\" Fauci replied.\n\nTrump has come under heavy criticism from Democrats for the shortage of testing kits and for downplaying the severity of the pandemic. At one point, he compared it to the flu. Fauci has said the virus is worse than the flu and that things \"will get worse before they get better.\"\n\nWhen Trump declared a national emergency last week, he denied any responsibility for the shortage.\n\n\"No, I don't take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time,\" Trump said during a news conference in the Rose Garden. \"It wasn't meant for this kind of an event.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday, there were more than 6,300 cases recorded in the United States and nearly 100 deaths. To expand testing, Trump announced partnerships with American companies to make kits available.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I believe now that the CDC and the FDA and the department, that we've got it right now, because we're handing much of it over to the private sector to heavy-hitter companies that do this for a living,\" Fauci said. \"And I think what you're going to be seeing looking forward is a major, major improvement in the availability of testing.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "louis_casiano@foxnews.com", "name": "Louis Casiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

"Power Line blog author Scott Johnson breaks down the story on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.'\n\nMinnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar unexpectedly praised President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday night, saying it was \"incredible and the right response in this critical time.\"\n\nOmar, normally a staunch critic of the White House who herself has repeatedly drawn the president's ire, went on to quote Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., as saying \"unprecedented times require unprecedented leadership\" -- and, Omar added, \"we are seeing that in our country right now.\"\n\n\"Finally, we should never let politics get in the way of good policy,\" Omar concluded. \"This is a great start and hope others will be part of a united front to push for good policies that will help us work through the economic anxiety the country is feeling right now.\"\n\nOmar was responding to a post by The Intercept's Lee Fang, who noted: \"Trump suspending mortgage foreclosures, demanding cash payments to Americans, now invoking the Defense Production Act to force private firms to produce needed supplies is incredible. Kind of a shell shock for anyone who reported on any economic policies in the Obama years.\"\n\nHer praise for the president was matched this week by other Democrats and left-of-center commentators. New York. Gov Andrew Cuomo, on Tuesday, told reporters, \"His team is on it. They've been responsive. ... I want to say thank you.\" And, CNN's Dana Bash asserted that Trump's new tone on the coronavirus made him the \"kind of leader that people need.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump invoked rarely used emergency powers to marshal critical medical supplies against the coronavirus pandemic. Trump on Wednesday tapped his authority under the 70-year-old Defense Production Act to give the government more power to steer production by private companies and try to overcome shortages in masks, ventilators and other supplies.\n\nTWO CONGRESSMEN TEST POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS\n\nDescribing himself as a \"wartime president\" fighting an invisible enemy, the president also signed an aid package -- which the Senate approved earlier Wednesday -- that will guarantee sick leave to workers who fall ill.\n\nThe Canada-U.S. border, the world's longest, was effectively closed, save for commerce and essential travel, while the administration pushed its plan to send relief checks to millions of Americans.\n\nTrump said he will expand the nation's diagnostic testing capacity and deploy a Navy hospital ship to New York City, which is rapidly becoming an epicenter of the pandemic, and another such ship to the West Coast. And the Housing and Urban Development Department will suspend foreclosures and evictions through April to help the growing number of Americans who face losing jobs and missing rent and mortgage payments.\n\nTRUMP SIGNS NEW CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL -- WHAT'S IN IT?\n\nBut as Trump laid out efforts to help the economy, markets plummeted. As reporters quizzed the White House as to whether the term \"Chinese virus\" is racist, or whether an unnamed White House staffer actually used the term \"Kung Flu,\" gone were thousands of jobs and nearly all the gains that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had made since Trump took office.\n\nThe administration announcements came on a fast-moving day of developments across the capital, its empty streets standing in contrast to the whirlwind of activity inside the grand spaces of the White House and the Capitol.\n\nThe Senate overwhelmingly passed a second coronavirus response bill, which Trump signed Wednesday night. The vote was a lopsided 90-8 despite worries by many Republicans about a temporary new employer mandate to provide sick leave to workers who get COVID-19. The measure is also aimed at making tests for the virus-free.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration pushed forward its broad economic rescue plan, which proposes $500 billion in checks to millions of Americans, with the first checks to come April 6 if Congress approves.\n\nThe White House urged hospitals to cancel all elective surgeries to reduce the risk of being overwhelmed by cases. The president was pressed on why a number of celebrities, like professional basketball players, seemed to have easier access to diagnostic tests than ordinary citizens.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"Perhaps that's the story of life,\" Trump said. \"I've heard that happens on occasion.\"\n\nTrump dismissed a suggestion from his own treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, that the nation could face 20 percent unemployment at least in the short term.\n\nThat's an \"absolute total worst case scenario,\" Trump said. \"We're no way near it.\"\n\nThe government has told Americans to avoid groups of more than 10 people and the elderly to stay home while a pointed reminder was given to millennials to follow the guidelines and avoid social gatherings. Trump likened the effort to the measures taken during World War II and said it would require national \"sacrifice.\"\n\n\"It's a war,\" he said. \"I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. It's a very tough situation.\"\n\nThe White House has had several coronavirus-related health scares, with the president himself exposed to at least three people who later tested positive. Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Wednesday that she had tested negative for the virus. McDaniel, who met last week with the president and Senate Republicans, had previously been exposed to someone who tested positive.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox

He said it would remain to be seen whether it would help combat the crisis.\n\n\"I think it could be a game-changer, and maybe not,\" he said.\n\nIt's the latest aggressive move by the administration as it seeks to stop both the spread of the virus, and also curb the economic havoc caused by the closing of much of American daily life as businesses and schools have shuttered to stop infections.

He has not yet used the powers invoged in it, however.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration has been working with Congress on a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package to reinvigorate the U.S. economy and to

nursing home and shared by Kline on Facebook.\n\nKline, who's seen through a window screen, sings alongside his wife Ann, who is lying in bed. The heart-tugging video had at least 58,000 views and 1,400 shares as of Sunday morning.\n\n4 NEW JERSEY FAMILY MEMBERS DIE, 3 OTHERS HOSPITALIZED AFTER CONTRACTING CORONAVIRUS\n\n\"Through a Pane -- not a Pain.

I love my Sweet Ann and look forward to spending eternity with her. God bless you for even looking -- and if you listened, well that was because you wanted to hear Ann.\"\n\nLast week, Alabama issued a statewide order limiting visitation at nursing homes and extended-care facilities to curb the spread of infection among the elderly, who are most vulnerable to the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe restrictions wouldn't stop John Kline's daily visits with his wife, also 80, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 17 years ago. Before the new measures, he would finish his day as a distinguished professor of leadership at Troy University and head over to spend a few hours with Ann, sharing dinner and a goodnight kiss.\n\n\"I've always said how much I love her, 'til death do us part,\" Kline told the Montgomery Advertiser on Friday. \"But I'm trying to make the statement that no matter what happens, there's no reason to give up on love. If she gets where she doesn't know me, I will still go see her, because I will still know her.\"\n\nKline said he now spends about 15 minutes a day outside his wife's window singing songs from the 1950s and church hymns, such as \"Jesus Loves Me,\" to help her remember their times together.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"He doesn't want her to forget him, and it's very important for

Democratic Senator Joe Manchin weighs in on coronavirus aid package and outbreak response.\n\nThe Senate on Wednesday passed the House's coronavirus legislation to provide sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans, sending the second COVID-19 relief bill to President Trump.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had criticized the legislation negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as having \"real shortcomings\", but urged his members to \"gag and vote for it anyway\" to show bipartisan cooperation during the global pandemic.\n\n\"This is a time for urgent bipartisan action, and in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,\" McConnell said Wednesday morning in announcing he'd vote for the House legislation.\n\nThe Senate passed the legislation in a 90-8 vote.\n\nThe legislation that Trump is expected to sign into law would provide 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensure free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expand food aid and unemployment dollars to states.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE CORONAVIRUS BILL BEFORE CONGRESS\n\nNext up, the Senate and White House have been moving quickly to draft a third round of stimulus legislation that could infuse about $1 trillion into the U.S. economy that has been rattled by school closures, business shutdowns and steep declines in the travel and tourism industry as many Americans are stuck home.\n\nMcConnell signaled Wednesday that Senate Republicans were close to an agreement on the next round of legislation that would help businesses, American workers, health-care professionals and others hard hit by the public health emergency.\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEEKS 2 ROUNDS OF CHECKS TO AMERICANS IN MASSIVE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE\n\n\"Yeah, we're working along and hoping to be together shortly,\" McConnell told reporters when asked whether Republicans were close on legislation.\n\nThe House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health-care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that passed Wednesday aims to bring relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered.\n\nTrump backed the plan that passed the House early Saturday morning with broad bipartisan support in a 363-40 vote. The legislation moved so hastily, bypassing the normal review processes, that the House had to make corrections to the bill language Monday.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the Senate defeated amendments to the House legislation that were offered by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and a third by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.\n\nNow, all eyes turn to the third round of stimulus that could infuse Americans' bank accounts with direct cash payments, an idea pushed by the far left and the White House.\n\nThe Trump administration has been seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by Fox Business.\n\nThe two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size, according to the Treasury Department document on the \"Stage Three\" coronavirus proposal.\n\nThe Trump proposal would provide $50 billion for lending to the airline industry and another $150 billion to \"other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy\" through secured lending or loan guarantees.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Trump administration also signaled it wanted $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to prevent the spread of the COVID-19.\n\nThe details of the plan are fast-moving and in flux. But McConnell pledged the Senate won't recess until another round of stimulus is passed.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":
