The first case of coronavirus in the United States was confirmed Tuesday in Seattle, after a man arrived home last week -- before the airport health screenings were announced.\n\nWhat is the disease?\n\nCoronaviruses are a family of viruses named after their appearance, a crown, said Dr. Mark Rupp, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nThere are many types and a few are known to infect humans. Some cause colds and respiratory illnesses, while others have evolved into illnesses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\n\nSARS began in China and infected some 8,000 people during a 2002-2003 outbreak. Approximately 770 people died after it spread to other cities and countries.\n\nSPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS PROMPTS CDC TO EXPAND 'ENHANCED HEALTH SCREENINGS' TO 2 MORE US AIRPORTS\n\n\"This is the third kind of novel coronavirus that we're having experience with that can cause lower respiratory tract disease,\" Rupp said Tuesday.\n\nIn some rare cases, the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans but are typically transferred during contact between humans, according to the CDC.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nCommon symptoms include headaches, a runny nose, fever, sore throat and cough. Human coronaviruses can result in lower-respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchitis, according to the CDC.\n\nSymptoms for SARS and MERS are much more severe than for common coronaviruses. Both cause respiratory problems. Those infected with MERS may also feel fatigued, experience shortness of breath and could develop kidney failure.\n\nAbout three or four out of 10 people that were reported to have MERS have died, according to the CDC.\n\nHow is the virus spread?\n\nCoronaviruses are commonly spread through the air by coughing and sneezing or personal contact such as shaking hands or touching. Another way the virus is spread is through touching objects with the virus on the surface and then touching yourself.\n\nPeople in the U.S. typically get infected during the fall and winter months but it is not uncommon for infections to occur in the spring and summer.\n\nCORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN CHINA SPARKS 'SUPER-SPREADER' FEARS AS PNEUMONIA-LIKE ILLNESS SICKENS HUNDREDS\n\nHow to treat it?\n\nThere is no vaccine for human coronaviruses, and most people will recover on their own. A room humidifier or hot shower can relieve a sore throat and cough, the CDC says. Mildly sick patients should drink liquids and rest as must as possible.\n\nThe CDC recommends washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and to avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAvoiding close contact with people will reduce the chances of infection. Those infected should stay home and avoid human-to-human contact, especially crowds.\n\nFox News' Madeline Farber contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news",

quarantining the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak and his debate with actor Mark Wahlberg on when to eat breakfast.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz on Thursday reacted to the Chinese government quarantining the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, explaining that such a virus is hard to contain once it begins to spread from person to person.\n\n\"It's very hard to wall this in once it starts,\" Oz told \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nOz said that detecting symptoms of coronavirus such as fever, sore throat, runny nose, cough, and headache will not help quarantine methods.\n\nHOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS?\n\nOz went on to say, \"It takes maybe a week for the symptoms to arise after you're infected, so if you're on a plane and the person next to you has the virus and they get pulled in to quarantine, you're still going to be walking through there.\"\n\nOz said that the virus started from locals eating meat that had contact with infected rodents.\n\nThe Chinese government restricted travel in two additional cities after announcing a quarantine for the city of Wuhan -- the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus -- and suspended public transportation in the locations as of Thursday evening. The move comes as Beijing also announced the cancelation of major events indefinitely, including celebrations for the Lunar New Year.\n\nAuthorities in Huanggang, in Hubei Province, which is around 50 miles southeast of Wuhan, suspended bus and train service and temporarily closed enclosed venues like movie theatres and internet cafes, the city's public television said.\n\nRail service in Ezhou, a smaller city south of Huanggang, is also being stopped.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn all, an estimated 18 million people will be impacted by the restrictions in an effort to stop the

'early stages' as focus turns to China's transparency", "body": "Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel breaks down the risks posed by the virus and the symptoms to look for.\n\nOfficials with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are working on a vaccine to combat the deadly Chinese coronavirus that's sickened more than 400 people and killed at least 17, an NIH spokesperson told Fox News on Wednesday. The news comes as Chinese officials are reportedly warning against any attempts at a cover-up as the pneumonia-like disease continues to spread.\n\n\"I can confirm that we are at the very early stages of developing a vaccine to combat the Wuhan coronavirus,\" Kath Stover, the branch chief for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said in an email.\n\nFIRST CASE OF CHINA-LINKED CORONAVIRUS REPORTED IN US, FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY\n\nStover was unable to provide additional details at this time, but did note that more information on the initiative is expected to emerge in the \"coming days.\"\n\nThe news comes as top officials in China have reportedly warned lower-level officials to not cover up the spread of the new coronavirus, which began at an animal and seafood market in the city of Wuhan and is now said to be transmissible between humans.\n\nAny lower-level officials who attempt to conceal new cases would \"be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity,\" officials with the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, a top political body in the country that handles law and order, allegedly said, according to the BBC.\n\nThe warning was sparked after information was reportedly withheld from the public at the start of the outbreak. More specifically, the number of cases was underreported and the risks of the new coronavirus were understated.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has since pushed for all information regarding the outbreak to be made readily available, according to the BBC, which cited Chinese state media. He reportedly added that \"all-out efforts\" are being made to control the spread of the virus.\n\nHUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION OF CORONAVIRUS IN CHINA CONFIRMED\n\nThe call for transparency comes after China saw a deadly outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003. At the time, some 8,000 people were infected while at least 770 died after the disease spread to other cities and countries across the world.\n\nAt the time, China was accused over covering up the outbreak, which was not announced to the public until about five months after it began, according to The New York Times, which noted government officials now say they have learned from \"past mistakes.\"\n\n\"Anyone who puts the face of politicians before the interests of the people will be the sinner of a millennium to the party and the people,\" said a statement from the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nThe virus has spread to at least five countries, including the U.S. On Tuesday, federal health officials said a man in Seattle, Wash., who had recently traveled to Wuhan is infected. The case marks the first in the country since the outbreak began.\n\nThe man, who is in his 30s, arrived in the U.S. last week before officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced \"enhanced health screenings\" for airline passengers arriving from or traveling through the Wuhan province.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe patient, who was not identified, is a resident of the U.S. and is in stable condition, CDC officials said during a Tuesday news conference. He is isolated at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Wash., and poses \"very little risk\" to medical staff and the public, officials said. The man was reportedly aware of the outbreak affecting Wuhan before falling ill and proactively reached out to state health officials when he began experiencing symptoms, which have been reported to include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.\n\nThe patient did not arrive on a direct flight from Wuhan, meaning people on more than one flight may have been exposed to the illness, which officials this week confirmed is transmissible between humans. Officials are now working to determine who may be at risk, Dr. Scott Lindquist, the Washington State epidemiologist for communicable diseases, said during the news conference.", "source": {"uri":

that's claimed at least 17 lives and sickened hundreds of others, how can you protect yourself?\n\nThe novel coronavirus that's to blame for the illnesses began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread to at least five countries -- including the United States. Federal health officials this week announced that a man who lives in Seattle but recently traveled to Wuhan was diagnosed with the illness, ultimately sparking fears there could be more cases in this country.\n\nCORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK PROMPTS VIRGINIA SCHOOL TO CANCEL VISIT OF CHINESE EXCHANGE STUDENTS\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains that the risk to the public is currently low. But since scientists have confirmed the disease is indeed transmissible between humans, there are a few things you can do to keep yourself as healthy as possible.\n\nCoronaviruses, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), are a large family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses, from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) -- the latter of which also began in China and infected some 8,000 people during a 2002-2003 outbreak. At least 770 died after it spread to other cities and countries across the world.\n\nCoronaviruses can spread between animals and people -- meaning they are zoonotic. Officials have said the current outbreak likely began at an animal and seafood market in Wuhan.\n\nSymptoms of 2019-nCoV, the novel coronavirus, have been reported to include fever, cough and shortness of breath.\n\nThe Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, noted that the symptoms are similar to other respiratory infections. Most U.S. residents experiencing symptoms are likely infected with the flu or \"some other virus,\" he told Scientific American.\n\n\"But if they came from Wuhan,\" he noted, \"it's likely to be the new coronavirus.\"\n\n\"The symptoms are very common to a number of viruses, though, so [the association] is based on epidemiology [and is confirmed by the rRT-PCR test],\" he added.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn't much you can do to protect yourself from coronaviruses aside from following basic wellness practices.\n\nAt this time, there is no vaccine to protect against coronavirus infections. That said, officials with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) confirmed to Fox News this week that they are working on a vaccine to combat the China-linked coronavirus.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOfficials with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases have obtained the genetic sequence of the virus from the Chinese to begin developing a vaccine, Fauci told Scientific American.\n\nHowever, \"That doesn't mean we will have a vaccine ready for use in three months; even in an emergency, that would take a year or more,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

Here's what you need to know as you start your Monday ...\n\nTrump defense team gets last-minute reinforcements as Senate impeachment trial is set to begin\n\nAfter an opening salvo of back-and-forth arguments from President Trump's attorneys and Democrats' impeachment managers on Monday, Senate impeachment trial proceedings are set to begin at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday with the expectation they will stretch well into the night on Capitol Hill -- even as key procedural questions, including the timeline for debate and whether additional witnesses will testify, remain undecided and hotly contentious.\n\nIn a surprise move Monday night, a group of high-profile House Republicans announced that they would formally join the president's legal team, including Reps. Doug Collins, Mike Johnson, Jim Jordan, Debbie Lesko, Mark Meadows, John Ratcliffe, Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin. The last-minute show of force underscored the fluid nature of the Senate trial, which is also set to feature full-throated arguments against impeachment from constitutional scholar Alan Dershowitz and Bill Clinton independent counsel Ken Starr.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell revealed Monday that he wanted a condensed, two-day calendar for each side to give opening statements, at 12 hours per day. After the four days of opening arguments, senators would be allowed up to 16 hours for written questions to the prosecution and defense, followed by four hours of debate. Only then would there be votes on calling other witnesses, likely next week. Much of Tuesday's proceedings will focus on debate over McConnell's proposed resolution for the parameters for the impeachment trial.

coronavirus?", "body": "As a new strain of deadly coronavirus infecting hundreds in China crosses international borders into the U.S., this outbreak begs the question: how do you treat coronavirus?\n\nThe new strain of coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has killed at least 17 people and sickened close to 600 others since December. It has spread to five countries and at least one case has been reported in the U.S., in a Seattle resident who recently traveled to Wuhan.\n\nFox News received an in-depth look at the new disease from Dr. Debra Chew, a former epidemic intelligence officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and an assistant professor of medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School to find out what someone infected with the virus can do to overcome it.\n\nHOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM CORONAVIRUS\n\nCurrently, the pneumonia-like virus -- like many viruses -- has no specific cure. Since it is a new illness, there is no vaccine, and it will likely take years before one is developed, according to Chew.\n\nInfected patients should treat symptoms the same way they would a cold -- with rest, pain or fever medication and plenty of fluids.\n\nThough coronaviruses, named for their crown-like shape, have been around for years, the Wuhan coronavirus has not previously been identified in humans. The virus can cause other respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, or more severe illnesses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n\nMERS first appeared in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and then in other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Europe, and about 858 people died as a result of the outbreak. In 2003, 774 people died from a SARS outbreak.\n\n\"Currently, a lot is unknown about the Wuhan coronavirus, but the CDC and the World Health Organization are actively investigating to learn more about this virus, the way it spreads and its severity of illness,\" Chew told Fox News.\n\nHOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS?\n\nThe immediate health risk posed by the Wuhan coronavirus is low in America. Doctors believe the disease originated with an animal source, as many of the confirmed early cases were linked to a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan. Some person-to-person spread has occurred in those who were in close contact with an infected patient, however.\n\nA new study published Wednesday found that the infection may have originated in snakes.\n\n\"Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein may contribute to cross\u2010species transmission from snake to humans,\" a group of Chinese scientists wrote in a study published in the Journal of Medical Virology. The two specific types of snake cited were the Chinese cobra and Chinese krait.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt's not clear whether there is an increased risk of transmission to various groups of people, such as pregnant women or different age groups. However, the young, elderly and those with immuno-compromised host immune systems or other chronic medical conditions could contract more severe illnesses as a result.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, the CDC is routing U.S.-bound travelers from Wuhan for screening at airports in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Chicago. The Chinese government has quarantined the city of Wuhan, shutting down its airport and public transportation.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors":

However, in their most recent update authorities said the number had risen to over 200. The early cases had been tied to a seafood market in Wuhan, but since then authorities in other regions have confirmed illnesses in residents. At least three deaths have been linked to the pneumonia-like illness.\n\nThe outbreak has spurred other countries to warn the millions of travelers boarding planes and trains for the Lunar New Year holidays. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), announced \"enhanced health screenings\" for airline passengers arriving from or traveling through the Wuhan province. San Francisco International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport all began the initiative on Jan. 17.\n\nCHINA COUNTS SHARP RISE IN CORONAVIRUS CASES DURING COUNTRY'S BUSIEST TRAVEL TIME\n\nSouth Korea, Japan and Thailand have all reported cases of the virus. Officials are still scrambling to determine its origin. The virus has sparked fears of a SARS re-emergence, but officials have been quick to shut down those theories.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChinese authorities have been in contact with the World Health Organization (WHO), which is also monitoring the situation.

Two 89-year-old men were the oldest of the 17 victims, according to the report.\n\nOne epidemiologist told The New York Times that the information released could be seen as reassuring because \"the majority of fatal cases are elderly and/or have a chronic disease that would increase their susceptibility to infectious diseases.\" However, several of the people who died did not have symptoms of fever when they first sought treatment.

The restrictions come just before the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people are expected to travel through China for the celebrations.\n\nOn Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was \"too early\" to consider the virus a global health emergency.

outbreak", "body": "Infectious disease expert Dr. Amesh Adalja on what you need to know about the disease.\n\nAs news of the first novel coronavirus diagnosis in the U.S. made headlines and aggressive containment measures in China have been instituted, many Americans may be wondering what risk this virus poses to them and how they can protect themselves. While information is changing minute-to-minute, there are important facts that can help to dispel panic but yet not minimize the importance of this outbreak.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are responsible for about a quarter of the cases of the common cold but amongst this family are two notable members which have the capacity to cause severe disease: SARS and MERS. When this novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan it immediately set off alarms because it appeared in the country in which SARS originated, was linked to possible animal exposure, and was causing people to be hospitalized with pneumonia. Other symptoms include cough, runny nose, sore throat, and fever - hard to distinguish from the myriad upper respiratory infections that people perennially suffer from. There are currently no coronavirus vaccines or antivirals.\n\nDR. OZ REACTS TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: VERY HARD TO 'WALL IT IN' ONCE IT STARTS\n\nThus far, this outbreak has killed 17 individuals - many of whom had other medical conditions - and infected at least 500. The case-patient in the U.S. has recovered and is not being hospitalized for any medical interventions. It has been imported to several countries and has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to convene an emergency meeting. The CDC is screening and educating travelers to the U.S. from Wuhan via 5 international airports that all impacted passengers are being routed to.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThere are several important questions that are important to answer in order to fully assess the risk of this virus, two of which are key:\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn my analysis, given the caveats and uncertainty, I do not believe that there is a reason for Americans to panic. In the past, the U.S. has absorbed cases of MERS and SARS without any dire consequences. Americans should, however, pay attention to this outbreak because we will likely have more cases (hopefully uncomplicated) diagnosed here and awareness of the outbreak can help the response to any cases we do have and minimize overreaction, which can prompt poor decision-making by policymakers. All hospitals should be prepared to routinely ask travel history questions and promptly identify those at risk and take the appropriate actions.\n\nI believe that if Americans understand and pay attention to the answers to the above key questions, it will help them conceptualize the level of risk we face.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors":

disease.\n\nA middle school in Northern Virginia this week canceled a visit of 21 Chinese exchange students and their chaperones amid the China-linked coronavirus outbreak that's sickened more than 500 people and killed at least 17.\n\nIn a letter sent to parents on Wednesday, Carole Kihm, the principal of Longfellow Middle School in Fairfax County, which the students were slated to temporarily attend, said they would no longer be visiting the school. The students are from Yichang in Hubei province -- the same province where Wuhan, the city where the outbreak first began, is located.\n\nFIRST CASE OF CHINA-LINKED CORONAVIRUS REPORTED IN US, FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY\n\nThe students, who are reportedly all 12 years old, arrived in the U.S. on Wednesday, the same day they were informed they could no longer visit the school. They flew into New York's John F. Kennedy airport - which recently began \"enhanced health screenings\" for airline passengers arriving from or traveling through the Wuhan province - and were expecting to take a bus to Falls Church and meet with their host families on Wednesday evening, The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn the letter, also posted to the Fairfax County Public Schools website, Kihm said the move was out of \"an abundance of caution\" and noted, \"student and staff health and safety remain our first priority.\" A spokesperson for Fairfax County Public Schools told WTOP that none of the students showed signs of illness.\n\n\"While health officials believe the risk of illness transmission of the novel Coronavirus from these students is extremely low, we felt it necessary to make this adjustment,\" Kihm added.\n\nInstead, the students will remain in the U.S. and will be participating in \"cultural and educational activities\" in the Washington, D.C. area, according to the letter.\n\nHUMAN-TO-HUMAN TRANSMISSION OF CORONAVIRUS IN CHINA CONFIRMED\n\nThe news comes after China halted all travel from Wuhan and at least two other nearby cities. The restrictions come just before the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of people are expected to travel through China for the celebrations.\n\nCarole Kihm did not immediately return Fox News's request for additional comment on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madeline_farber@foxnews.com", "name": "Madeline Farber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Virginia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_disease_(medical_specialty)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infectious disease (medical specialty)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_County_Public_Schools", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fairfax County Public Schools"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

CONFIRMED IN US\n\nAbout 200 protesters had gathered in Wah Ming Road leading up to the recently built but vacant Fai Ming Estate located in Hong Kong's Fanling District, South China Morning Post reported. Several protesters wearing black masks ran into the public housing unit and ignited a Molotov cocktail before running out of the building, Reuters reported. Clouds of black smoke were then seen coming out of the unit. Fire alarms went off. Some windows also had been smashed, according to Reuters. Videos surfaced online showing protesters in black protective masks fleeing the fiery scene.\n\n\"In the evening, rioters damaged the traffic lights at the junction of Fai Ming Road and Wah Ming Road, and set fire to the lobby of buildings by throwing petrol bombs,\" Hong Kong Police said in a statement. \"These destructive acts have posed a grave threat to the safety of people at [the] scene. Police warn all rioters to stop these unlawful acts. Police will take resolute enforcement actions.\"\n\nFirefighters responded to put out the blaze. The damage appeared to be contained to the building's lobby. Hundreds of riot police also descended on the area. At least one person was arrested, Reuters reported. The Center for Health Protection later announced it suspended the plan to turn the public housing block into a quarantine zone, Hong Kong Free Press reported.\n\nHONG KONG'S LAM SAYS CHINESE MILITARY COULD STEP IN IF UPRISING WORSENS\n\nProtesters had created barricades and lined the road leading up to the building with bricks. They opposed the government's decision to use the newly built building as a quarantine zone, fearing its location near a school and the city's main residential area posed too great of a risk for infection.\n\nSix people in Hong Kong had been diagnosed with the Wuhan coronavirus as of Sunday. The Hong Kong government elevated its response to \"emergency\" level, instituting a series of school closures, flight suspensions, event cancellations and theme park closures -- including shutting down Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam had signaled in a speech Saturday that the Fai Ming Estate could have been used as either a quarantine zone or a place to house medical staff fighting the outbreak, the South China Post reported.\n\nBy Sunday, Lam issued a measure banning all residents of the Chinese Hubei Province, where the outbreak originated, and anyone who visited the province within the past 14 days from entering the city. The ban did not apply to Hong Kong residents.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe outbreak, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has claimed the lives of at least 56 people - most of whom perished in mainland China. Hong Kong is trying to prevent the coronavirus from spreading from the mainland to the world financial hub, which has already been grappling with months of sometimes violent anti-government, pro-democracy demonstrations.\n\nThe novel virus has sickened nearly 2,000 people worldwide. Like the SARS virus in 2002-03, the new coronavirus is thought initially to have been transmitted from animals to people via the consumption of exotic wildlife. The third case of coronavirus in the U.S. was confirmed in Southern California on Saturday, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency's Communicable Disease Control Division. Canada, Australia and Malaysia also reported their first cases Saturday.\n\nFox News' Brie Stimson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType":

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nDANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: So, my final thought is that the Democrats who think the so-called moderate, even though they are conservative people, moderate republicans are going to save them in this impeachment trial, I don't think it will happen. I'm going to go on record now. I predict that Susan Collins of Maine will win reelection. Mitch McConnell will definitely have her back and she will be considered one of the heroes of 2020. That's my thought (INAUDIBLE).\n\nGREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: I'm a hero.\n\nPERINO: Set your DVRs as you are here. Never miss an episode of THE FIVE. \"SPECIAL REPORT\" is up next.\n\nGUTFELD: I'm a hero.\n\nBRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. \"BREAKING TONIGHT\" as opening arguments began in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. The president unleashes a scathing attack on one of the House impeachment managers, who accused overnight senators of being part of a cover-up. President, also threatening to attend the proceeding and sit right in the front row. Democrats began their presentation about five hours ago and have a total of 24 hours to deliver this opening argument. We have \"FOX TEAM COVERAGE\". John Roberts in Davos, Switzerland, where the president went off on the impeachment prosecutors before leaving home. But we begin with chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel with what's happening right now. Good evening, Mike.\n\nMIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. President Trump's attorneys did not file a motion to dismiss because they say their focus is on acquittal. On the other side, House Democrats are now in the early hours making their case for conviction.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): The president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box. For we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly one.\n\nEMANUEL: Lead impeachment manager, Adam Schiff laying out the case against President Trump, and appealing to senators to keep their focus on this urgent matter.\n\nSCHIFF: I recognize there'll be times during the trial that you may long to return to the business of the Senate. The American people look forward to the same, but not before you decide what kind of democracy that you believe we ought to be. And what the American people have a right to expect in the conduct of their presidents.\n\nEMANUEL: Then, it was judiciary chairman, Jerry Nadler's turn.\n\nREP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): This is the story of a corrupt government-wide effort that drew in ambassadors, cabinet officials, executive branch agencies, and the office of the president.\n\nEMANUEL: Allies of the president greeted today's presentation with a yawn. Democrats get up to 24 hours to lay out their case against the president, and then attorneys for President Trump will take over.\n\nJAY SEKULOW, CHIEF COUNSEL, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: We will challenge aggressively the case that they're putting forward based on what we're hearing. And we also have an affirmative case that we're going to make as well. So, we're going to do both.\n\nEMANUEL: Schiff is once again caught up in controversy. POLITICO's first to report that he mischaracterized a text message between two players in the Ukraine scandal. Schiff sent a letter to fellow impeachment manager Jerry Nadler last week, summarizing evidence gathered from Rudy Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas. Parnas tells Giuliani in a text message, \"Trying to get us Mr. Z\", Schiff took that to be a reference to Ukrainian President Zelensky, instead, it was the founder of Burisma, Zlochevsky. Schumer is defending his own tactics, keeping senators in the chamber until nearly 2:00 a.m. on opening day for 11 amendments which all failed. And gave Schiff high marks for today's presentation.\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Adam Schiff's speech was one of the most compelling I have heard. It was a tour de force. And I think that a good number of my Republican colleagues for the first time, heard the entire arguments powerfully, succinctly, and completely.\n\nEMANUEL: The Senate Republican whip, says Schumer's focus is really on Senate races in November.\n\nSEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): Senator Schumer, you know, their goal is to win the majority in the Senate. And so, this has a lot less to do, I think, with litigating the case then with, you know, and trying to drive a political message.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nEMANUEL: House managers are arguing the Senate must act or it will send a terrible message to future presidents, but it's not clear how that message will resonate with senators tied to their desks for long days of presentations. Bret.\n\nBAIER: Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill. Mike, thanks. Also, \"BREAKING TONIGHT\", President Trump has just landed. There you see Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, after two days at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. On his way out, he took some parting shots at impeachment. He also retweeted a number of senators and congressmen as he was flying home on Air Force One. We expect him to deplane there any minute. We'll bring you that. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts, meantime is in Zurich tonight, with all the latest from the president. Hi, John.\n\nJOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Bret. And just the very fact that President Trump made the trip to Davos, as the Senate trial was beginning to unfold was a real finger in the eye to Democrats who were trying to boot him from the Oval Office. And on his way out the door from Davos today. President Trump poke them in the eye just a little harder.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nROBERTS: Wrapping up the Davos economic forum, President Trump today told Fox News he's not pushing for a swift acquittal.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think that the -- I would rather go the long way.\n\nROBERTS: The long way, included witnesses that Democrats had been arguing to hear from.\n\nTRUMP: I would rather interview Bolton. I would rather interview a lot of people.\n\nROBERTS: But just as quickly as the president raised the idea of hearing from former National Security advisor, John Bolton, he appeared to shoot it down.\n\nTRUMP: The problem with John is that it's a national security problem. He knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders, and what happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader, and it's not very positive, and then, I have to deal on behalf of the country.\n\nROBERTS: The president also suggesting Bolton may have an ax to grind.\n\nTRUMP: I don't know if we left in the best of terms. I would say probably not, you know, and so, you don't like people testifying when they didn't leave on good terms, and that was due to me, not due to him.\n\nROBERTS: Bolton was the catalyst for the confrontation last night between Jerrold Nadler and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone. Today, President Trump left to his counsel's defense.\n\nTRUMP: Jerrold Nadler, I've known him a long time. He's a sleazebag. Pat's a brilliant guy, but I've never seen that emotion. And that's a real emotion that's because he knows this is a hoax. And I was very proud of the job he did.\n\nROBERTS: The president mused today that he'd like to watch the trial unfold in person.\n\nTRUMP: I'd love to go. Wouldn't that be great? Wouldn't that be beautiful?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Anyway (INAUDIBLE) so, why don't you go?\n\nTRUMP: I don't know, I'd sort of love to sit right in the front row and stare their corrupt faces. I'd love to do it.\n\nROBERTS: President Trump's news conference kept a day and a half of meetings with world leaders and business executives in Davos, meetings he and his team claimed along with new trade deals will boost America's economic prosperity.\n\nLARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It is the American blue- collar middle class. They have the fastest wage growth. And in fact, the lower wage folks are getting the fastest wage increases, exceeding significantly from what their managers are making.\n\nROBERTS: But the president also waited into controversy when asked about injuries sustained by U.S. service members in that Iranian missile attack on January 7th.\n\nTRUMP: I heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things. I've seen what Iran is done with their roadside bombs to our troops. I've seen people with no legs and with no arms. No, I do not consider that to be bad injuries. No.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nROBERTS: On his way back to Washington, the president tweeted several times about impeachment, including one tweet that simply said, no pressure. He also retweeted a tweet from Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who said, I heard you'd like to come to the Senate and watch the trial. You have my invitation to appear. Bret?\n\nBAIER: And that would be something. John Roberts, live in Zurich. John, thanks. We just missed the president coming down Air Force One as he heads back to the White House. We are going to head back and we'll be doing this throughout the show to Capitol Hill. Right now, House manager, representative from New York Hakeem Jeffries continues to lay out the case for impeaching and removing the President Trump.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): -- corrupt former prosecutor-general. Joe Biden did nothing wrong. The witnesses testified that Vice President Biden was, in fact, carrying out official U.S. policy to clean up the prosecuted general's office in Ukraine. This policy, of course, aligned with the perspective of many in this very distinguished body, as well as our European allies throughout the world, as well as the International Monetary Fund. Vice President Biden did not remove Yuriy Lutsenko, the corrupt prosecutor, the Ukrainian government did with the support of the free world. Nonetheless, on October 3rd, 2019, when a reporter asked President Trump, what exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens after your phone call? President Trump responded as follows.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, what exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens after your phone call? Exactly.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer.\n\nJEFFRIES: Start a major investigation into the Bidens. The evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump is hiding in plain sight. During the July 25th call, President Trump also repeatedly press the Ukrainian president to coordinate with his personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani. Why was Rudolph Giuliani's name mentioned multiple times during the July 25th phone call? Giuliani is not the Secretary of State. He's not an ambassador. He's not a member of the diplomatic corps. Rudolph Giuliani is a cold-blooded political operative for President Trump's reelection campaign. That is why he was referenced multiple times on that July 25th phone call. And it is evidence of corrupt intent by President Trump. By the time the call took place, President Zelensky understood Giuliani's connection to the shakedown scheme. He recognized Giuliani's role as the president's political operative. As matters related to Ukraine. Zelensky informed President Trump that one of his aides spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes. The Ukrainian leader knew Giuliani represented President Trump's political interest in his country and could help unlock the long sought-after Oval Office meeting that President Zelensky desire. The phony investigation sought by President Trump on July 25th call were not designed to bolster the national security interest of the United States of America. Quite the contrary, President Trump sought to benefit himself and his own reelection prospects. On the July 25th call, President Trump also suggested that President Zelensky speak with the Attorney General William Barr about the -- two fake investigations that the president sought. This is important to keep in mind. At no time during this entire sorted scheme --\n\nBAIER: Representative Hakeem Jeffries on the Senate floor talking about the phone calls. We've heard a lot about that phone call, obviously. The president during this trip, tweeting out, read the transcripts. We'll head back in as the House managers continue to make that case. Want to bring in the panel early Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist. Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com. And Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for Axios. Jonathan, your sense of how the White House and his -- and its team looks at what's happening here and how it's being absorbed.\n\nJONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: This squarely focused on four or five Republican senators, which is the same audience that Adam Schiff and the Democrats are really addressing. This is the Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, perhaps Rob Portman, perhaps Lamar Alexander. The senators who could conceivably vote for additional witnesses. So, what we saw today was Adam Schiff, trying to appeal to their sense of grandia, loftiness, guardians of the democracy, saw him quoting founding fathers and things like that. That was really a way of appealing to Susan Collins and those other senators to, in Schiff's mind do the -- do the duty? As for the White House, look, I think they're letting this play out, they're taking notes, they're watching, they haven't determined how long they're going to take for their defense. This -- I'm hearing they're probably going to take less than 24 hours to defend themselves. So, we'll see how that ends up playing out. And they're trying to make a really strong national security argument to these Republican senators to say, listen, you would be jeopardizing executive privilege. And you saw the president say that today. The argument they're making to Susan Collins is if you vote to subpoena John Bolton, you are compromising future president's ability to have confidential conversations with the National Security advisers.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBAIER: So, and that's important because the vote on witnesses and the vote on executive privilege while tied are two different votes.\n\nKATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: They're two different votes and the witnesses have different consequences. So, Hunter Biden is not someone who is affected by executive privilege and calling him as a witness as maybe a trade for John Bolton doesn't put --\n\nPAVLICH: Which they've discussed, doesn't put the issue of executive privilege in a press -- in a press -- setting a president context of damaging the Office of the President. And so, that has been put on the table and walked back a bit by some Democrats, who maybe wanted to try and get John Bolton. But, I think the bigger picture here is that Adam Schiff is yes, playing to the senators, of course. He's also trying to play to the American people. You noted earlier, Bret that the number one question being asked on Google today is what is the president being impeached for? And what I noticed today during Adam Schiff's opening statement is very close to the beginning and to the end, and Jerry Nadler did the same thing, discussed Russia a whole lot. And he talked about the Mueller investigation. And if he wants to go back to a narrative that didn't play out in terms of what he had been pushing for two years, while having a credibility problem that we saw today, with his mischaracterization of new text messages, I think Republican senators and the American people are going, we went through the Russia narrative, why are the Democrats bringing us back to that? And are they now impeaching him over Russia or is this about a phone call in July about Ukraine?\n\nBAIER: The other thing is, Ben, that overnight. A lot of people didn't see it, but Jerry Nadler really went on the offensive. Republicans noted that many times today about how he was calling the senators as part of a cover- up if they vote against the removal of President Trump to the point where the chief justice had to admonish. Now, he admonished both sides, but it was specifically after the Nadler engagement. Take a listen to Senator Mike Lee, on this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): I'm grateful to the chief justice. He did a good job, his demeanor was great. He maintained his patience. I thought that was unfair of him to direct that at both sets of councils because it felt to me like collective punishment for isolated guilt. This was the fault of the House management prosecution team. They were rude, they were insulting. They were demeaning not just to the president, but to their opposing counsel, and indeed to the Senate itself.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBAIER: And again, it happened early in the morning. And the chief justice said you need to remember where you are essentially. Today, I noted that Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler, they all started saying thank you, so much for your patience.\n\nBEN DOMENECH, FOUNDER AND PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST: We -- I think the American people are getting an object lesson and the differences between the two sides of Capitol Hill. And they're certainly things that have riled up the different members on the House side over the course of this period, that have led them to the point where they would engage in this type of behavior on the Senate floor. But for the senators themselves, they expect something better than that. They expect more of an honorable approach to this thing. I think that you saw today an attempt on the part of Schiff and others to readjust this whole thing and say, hey, look, you know, we're, we're not going to engage in that behavior anymore. But to circle back to, you know, Senator Schumer's remarks about Schiff's presentation, calling it a tour de force. If it is, it's in the context of performance art, because that's what this is. It's performance art for a handful of senators that they hope to peel away. And it's a performance art that they hope to use and a lot of different campaign ads across the course of 2020. That's something that I think we have to understand this in the proper context here. This is not designed to achieve some kind of a sea change. They don't think that they can get anything close to that.\n\nBAIER: And barring witnesses that dropped some astonishing revelation, changing 20 Republican votes, we all get, we can't do that math, you can't get there from here, knowing what we know now.\n\nDOMENECH: Right.\n\nBAIER: Knowing that, if that's the case, the all of this is to just paint a picture for the election?\n\nSWAN: So, yes, in short, it's a way every day -- it's a way to try and make life very uncomfortable for these purple state Republicans who are up for reelection.\n\nBAIER: And Doug Jones from Alabama doesn't feel any pressure?\n\nSWAN: I don't know how he feels, but I can't imagine how he doesn't feel pressure. When you're a Democrat in Alabama --\n\nSWAN: And you're not siding with Donald Trump? Yes, I mentioned you feel a little bit of pressure.\n\nBAIER: And so, you wonder how all of that is going to play out when you get to that point. We will have listened to a lot. I mean, hours and hours and hours. And then, they'll have this vote on witnesses.\n\nPAVLICH: And the political process of this is something that Democrats have denied is part of it. And Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said this was solemn occasion. Chuck Schumer has tried to argue that this is not about politics but knowing the outcome going into this situation of knowing the president will not be removed from office. That certainly is about politics, and it is about politics, specifically for Adam Schiff.\n\nDOMENECH: And Schiff made that clear in his very opening remark that you played earlier, which is that this can't be decided at the ballot box. Issues in America are decided at the ballot box. This issue will be decided at the ballot box. And for him to say something like that is really saying, you know that even before, if we end up in November 2020, seeing Donald Trump reelected, he's already casting aspersions on that idea.\n\nBAIER: Or just take a look at the different rules. We've said this was matching the Clinton rules for the Clinton impeachment not exactly, but it's fairly close. Prosecution: 24 hours. 24 hours over three days for the Trump rules. There you see the one to one. 16 hours written questions, these are questions from the senators that will be asked actually by the chief justice to either side. There is no guaranteed vote on a motion to dismiss, one expected after the presentations. And there you see the four hours of whether the call witnesses, little bit different as you take a look at the rules. Panel, thank you. We're going to head back to Capitol Hill. Listen in on the Senate floor as Hakeem Jeffries continues the House manager's case, impeaching President Trump. We'll take a break on the other side.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJEFFRIES: His staff at the White House apparently believed otherwise. The press office issued a short and incomplete summary of the July 25 call. Let me read it for your hearing. \"Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to congratulate him on his recent -- \"\n\nJOHN G. ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES: Senate will be in order. The sergeant at arms will restore order in the gallery.\n\nJEFFRIES: And the scripture says, for the Lord loves justice, and will not abandon His faithful ones. Official White House call readout, July 25th, 2019. \"Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to congratulate him on his recent election. President Trump and President Zelensky discussed ways to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Ukraine, including energy and economic cooperation. Both leaders also expressed that they look forward to the opportunity to meet.\" That is the official White House call readout, dated July 25th, 2019. The official readout provided to the American people omitted key elements of the president's conversation. Let's review. The official readout did not mention the phony investigations requested by President Trump. The official readout did not mention the Oval Office meeting sought by President Zelensky. The official readout did not mention President Trump's elevation of a debunked conspiracy theory promoted by Vladimir Putin about 2016 election interference. The official readout did not mention President Trump's demand that Ukraine investigate his domestic political rival, Joe Biden. The official readout did not mention that President Trump maligned and threatened Ambassador Yovanovitch. And the official readout did not mention that President Trump praised a corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor. The complete conversation, however, between President Trump and President Zelensky that we just outlined offers powerful evidence that President Trump abused his power and solicited foreign interference in the 2016 election. The 2020 election. Several members of the president's staff, listening in on the call, immediately grew concerned. As he sat in the White House Situation Room, listening to the conversation, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, realized that the president's demands of the Ukrainian leader were inappropriate and improper. He quickly recognized that as the president began referencing the Bidens and CrowdStrike, the call was diverging from the official National Security Council approved talking points that he helped prepare.\n\nBAIER: You heard there a protester, the first of the Senate trial. The chief justice, saying, the sergeant at arms will get everything in order. And then, you could hear the yelling in the hallway as that person was taken out of the hall. We're expecting the Senate to take a break soon for dinner. Before they do, we'll get to behind the scenes, look at the process on Capitol Hill after we take a quick break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBAIER: Welcome back. We're still looking at the Senate floor. Hakeem Jeffries continuing the House manager's argument in addition to the drama we're witnessing on the Senate floor. There's plenty of action obviously, behind the scenes where we cannot bring you. Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has that part of the story tonight. Good evening, Chad.\n\nCHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Good evening.\n\nBAIER: First up, though, Chief Justice John Roberts inserted himself into the debate. We talked about that earlier just after midnight last night, cautioning both sides about their language on the floor, but may be pointed at one.\n\nPERGRAM: Yes, we saw nothing like this in the 1999 trial with President Clinton. You know Chief Justice William Rehnquist presided, he liked to keep behind the scenes. And John Roberts is a little bit like that, too. He assures the limelight, but he interjected himself last night after some remarks by Jerry Nadler, in particular, the Democrat from New York. Let's take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNADLER: Any senator who votes against Ambassador Bolton's testimony or any relevant testimony shows that he or she wants to be part of the cover-up.\n\nPAT CIPOLLONE, WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He accused you of a cover-up. The only one who should be embarrassed, Mr. Nadler, is you.\n\nJ. G. ROBERTS: I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPERGRAM: Now, Josh Hawley is a Republican senator from Missouri, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts. Hawley, says the admonition was out of character for Roberts.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. JOSH HAWLEY, (R-MO): That statement from him is a very extraordinary thing. I've never heard him deliver an admonishment like that from the bench ever. He chooses his words very, very carefully.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPERGRAM: Hawley says if Democrats are trying to convince Republican senators to convict the president, they took a step back last night, Bret.\n\nBAIER: Chad, the Senate controls the cameras and the feed of what we see inside the Senate chamber during the trial. We have to rely on sketches, actually, to get other views of what the cameras see. What' it like in there?\n\nPERGRAM: A good example of that is that protest just a few minutes ago. They didn't show the demonstrator. You could only hear that person once they dragged them out into the hallway. I was in the chamber a few minutes ago. There's a lot of senators who are milling about. Doug Jones, Democrat from Alabama, leaning on a back wall here. Some are kind of cycling back and forth between the cloak rooms. There are senators taking notes, copious notes. Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, they had big folders and binders at their desk there. Someone I noticed in the gallery a bit ago was Alyssa Milano, the actress. She was very present in the fall of 2018 for the confirmation hearings with Brett Kavanaugh. And the most popular place in the Senate chamber is the candy desk. A senator from Pennsylvania, in this case Pat Toomey, a Republican, has the candy desk -- remember, Hershey is based in Pennsylvania there -- and they stocked it with candy so senators can come by and get a sugar fix whenever they want. But I'll tell you, fatigue is starting to set in with these senators. That is why they're milling about. Just last night just two minutes after 2:00 right here I walked past Val Demings, one of the impeachment managers, Democrat from Florida, and I said good night. And she looked back and said, well, good morning. It was 2:00 in the morning, Bret. Back to you.\n\nBAIER: Chad, thank you very much. We want to take a moment, a few other stories making headlines today. Chinese authorities are trying to curtail the spread of a deadly virus by isolating the city where it began. More than 400 people have been infected and 17 now are known dead. Here in the U.S. the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, Disease Control and Prevention, is already dealing with one confirmed case inside the United States. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie is in Atlanta tonight.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chinese authorities are taking the dramatic step of quarantining the city of Wuhan, the suspected epicenter of an outbreak of a new coronavirus blamed for at least 17 deaths.\n\nTEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: Having the strong action, not only they will control the outbreak in their country, but they will also minimize the chances of this outbreak spreading internationally.\n\nSERRIE: President Trump praised public health officials for quickly identifying and quarantining the first U.S. patient to become ill with the virus.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're in great shape. The CDC did a fantastic job, immediately got the person.\n\nSERRIE: Doctors at this hospital in Washington state to say the man, in his 30s is, in satisfactory condition.\n\nDR. JAY COOK, PROVIDENCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER: Out of an abundance of caution, we have the patient being monitored in a special isolation unit.\n\nSERRIE: The patient says he did not visit this market in Wuhan were Chinese health officials believe live animal sold for meat initially passed the virus to humans. But he had been traveling in the region before returning to his home in the Seattle area. U.S. health officials are retracing the patient's travel history.\n\nALEX AZAR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: We are now tracing the close contacts of that individual to ensure that none of them are showing those symptoms.\n\nSERRIE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has activated its emergency operation center and is sending personnel to airports in Atlanta and Chicago O'Hare to assist with enhanced passenger screening already in place at airports in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York JFK.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSERRIE: An emergency committee of the World Health Organization will continue meeting Thursday in Geneva, Switzerland. The committee is currently split 50-50 on whether to declare this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Bret?\n\nBAIER: We'll follow that. Jonathan, thank you. Also making headlines today, just announced, President Trump will become the first president to address the March for Life live on the National Mall in person. That's according to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. A big deal, especially for pro-life supporters of the president. The event is scheduled for this Friday here in Washington, D.C. In the meantime, in New York opening statements began in the rape trial of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Prosecutors say he assaulted a woman in a Manhattan hotel room and 2013 and attacked another in 2006. Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. appeared at the same courthouse for a hearing in the case in which several women have accused him of groping. He has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. And on Wall Street today stocks were mixed. Today the Dow lost 10, the S&P 500 500 was up one, the Nasdaq gained 13. As we had to break, let's listen in again to the Senate floor. House Representative Hakeem Jeffries wrapping up as they're getting ready to take a break in the opening statements by the House managers. We will take a break as we listen in.\n\nHAKEEM JEFFRIES, (D-NY) HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE: -- and in competent. And in a perfect call, the president would not have directed a foreign leader to follow up with Rudolph Giuliani, a human hand grenade. This was not a perfect call. It is direct evidence that President Donald John Trump corruptly abused his power and solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nJOHN ROBERTS, SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE: The majority leader is recognized.\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL, (R) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, we will now take a 30-minute break for dinner, and reconvene at five minutes after seven. So I ask consent the Senate stand in recess until that time.\n\nROBERTS: Without objection, so ordered.\n\nBAIER: It is time for dinner for the senators, for the chief justice, for the House impeachment managers, and for the White House lawyers. We will take a break as well. On the other side we'll give you an update on the campaign trail, plus bring back our panel. Stay here.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBAIER: In tonight's Democracy 2020 report, some big numbers among Democratic presidential contenders. Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is suing Hillary Clinton for $50 million. And Bernie Sanders grabs 27 percent support, good for first place in a new national poll. Correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest tonight from Des Moines.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nPETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The caucuses are 12 days away.\n\nMAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D-IN) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My hope is that in a few days Iowa once again will be prepared to make history.\n\nDOOCY: But some of the top tier are stuck in a Senate trial.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (D-VT) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Obviously I would much prefer to be in Iowa campaigning.\n\nDOOCY: Sanders is doing fine anyway, knocking Biden out of first for the first time this cycle in a new national CNN poll and finishing a clear second to Biden in a new national Monmouth poll. So now he is trying to use Biden's words against them.\n\nJOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When I argued if we should free federal spending, I meant Social Security as well.\n\nDOOCY: The Biden team claims comments about spending bills are out of context, and they have got a file on Sanders too.\n\nBIDEN: It's like my going back and pointing out how Bernie voted against the Brady Bill five times while I was trying to get it passed.\n\nDOOCY: Sanders doesn't care.\n\nSANDERS: Biden wants to look at my record, that's fair. I will look at his record.\n\nDOOCY: Hillary Clinton went on the record saying, nobody likes Bernie Sanders. And now she is walking that back, tweeting, \"I thought everyone wanted my authentic, unvarnished views. But to be serious, the number one priority for our country and world is retiring Trump. And as I always have, I will do whatever I can to support our nominee.\" Sanders didn't ask Clinton for an apology, but Tulsi Gabbard did when she suggested Gabbard is a Russian asset. And no sorry from Clinton led to a Gabbard defamation lawsuit alleging actual malice, plus personal jabs like this. \"Tulsi Gabbard is running for president of the United States, a position Clinton has long coveted but has not been able to obtain.\" Ultimately, though, the focus today is on impeachment, or is it? Do you get a sense that a lot of the people you're talking to here are rushing from this event to go watch the impeachment trial, or are there other things that they are considering ahead of February 3rd?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I cannot remember the last time I got a question from a voter about impeachment.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nDOOCY: Joe Biden just got a question from a voter about impeachment, though. Would he or his son Hunter be part of a deal and testify in the trial if it meant John Bolton or Mick Mulvaney would testify in exchange? And Biden said he wants no part of that. Bret?\n\nBAIER: Peter Doocy live in the snowy Des Moines. Peter, thank you. We are back with our panel, Ben Domenech, Katie Pavlich, and Jonathan Swan. Ben, your state of the race and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, it only seems to be helping Bernie Sanders.\n\nBEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": This was the worst possible timing from Hillary Clinton if she wanted to hurt Bernie Sanders. Coming out in the way that she did, she just steps on her own message over and over again. Even that tweet, these were my authentic views, I think we all know what your authentic views are about Bernie Sanders. And to the degree that they are out, they actually help him in this moment.\n\nKATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: It also hurts the party. There is a reason why you continue to see players come out and say, no matter what happens with the nomination, even if Joe Biden were to win, we all need to vote for the nominee. Bernie Sanders are not interested in voting for an established candidate. It is a movement that is growing, and Hillary Clinton, I'm sure, the candidates in the Democratic race are not clamoring to get her endorsement.\n\nBAIER: We saw \"The New York Times\" with its double endorsement. There's probably an alert going around Democratic establishment types, CNN national poll, as Peter put up, Bernie Sanders with the lead. But if you look at the national Iowa and New Hampshire polls, he is right there. He could really surprise and win a couple of these.\n\nJONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Bret, at this point it wouldn't even be a surprise. I'm having flashbacks to January, 2016. And the way I read that \"New York Times\" endorsement, it was actually an endorsement, it was anyone but Bernie Sanders basically. And it's the same sort of -- the way Bernie Sanders is being treated largely, and I don't say, use a broad brush for the media, but he's been largely ignore until very recently. It's all right, you will see, like, he's number two in the polls or number one in Iowa and New Hampshire, and so doesn't get the coverage that, for example, Elizabeth Warren got when she was surging. And now you look, we're getting very close to Iowa and New Hampshire. He is probably the candidate best placed to win Iowa or New Hampshire given the demographics in those two states. And then you have, as we talked about before, he has organic support, real online support, the ability to build the sort of movement that Donald Trump did in 2016.\n\nBAIER: And his ground game, frankly, Ben. And you look at someplace like Iowa, he could go in there with a win, change the dynamic and the rules, the structure has changed after 2016 when his people said, this is not going to play with us.\n\nDOMENECH: I think that this, to Jonathan's point, this is a point where Democrats who have not been taking Bernie seriously all this time really do need to look at him and evaluate him in the lens as a serious potential nominee for the party. They need to understand what that does for them in 2020. We have heard a lot of different people come on here over the past year and say that that was maybe something that the White House wanted. I'm actually not sure that's the case. I think that Bernie is someone who excites a lot of people across a lot of different perspectives. He is viewed as authentic in a moment in which that is something that is very prized. And I do not think that this is something that people should treat as a fanciful fairy tale anymore. It's very real.\n\nBAIER: Next up -- thank you, panel -- final thoughts, and we're working a possible interview from Capitol Hill. Not going to promise it yet, but we'll see. We will check in on Capitol Hill either way. Jay Sekulow just off the Senate floor, we will talk to him live here on SPECIAL REPORT.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBAIER: Breaking tonight, analysis right now from one of the president's defenders, been on the Senate floor, attorney Jay Sekulow is on the impeachment team for the president. He joins us from Capitol Hill. It feels good to stand up, I'm sure.\n\nJAY SEKULOW, TRUMP IMPEACHMENT ATTORNEY: It does. Thanks, Bret.\n\nBAIER: Tell me what you thought of today so far and your impressions.\n\nSEKULOW: It's been as it was yesterday, these are long days. And so far the conclusion today, you heard through their statements and their presentation, this is what seems so odd to me. They're complaining -- we had a whole section where they were complaining about no Oval Office meeting because the meeting was actually at the United Nation's General Assembly with the president of Ukraine, with President Zelensky. That was an issue that was going on. And then a complaint that the delegation sent to President Zelensky's inaugural was not high enough. This is not impeachable. These policy disputes are not what the founders had in mind when it came to the seriousness of an article of impeachment or a conviction on impeachment. So I think, look, we basically are already into what I would call repeat cycle. We are hearing the same thing each time. Obviously we haven't put on our case yet. That's a couple of days away, but I'm quite confident of where this goes at the end of the day, but we are going through the process right now.\n\nBAIER: I want to take you backwards to early this morning, and then I want you to look forward. But backwards early this morning, there was this dust up between Jerry Nadler on the floor, and then you and Pat Cipollone came up and admonished him for what he was saying. And then the chief justice got in the middle of it. What is your take of that moment and how it all went down?\n\nSEKULOW: Look, Jerry Nadler accused the United States Senate of being liars and also of a cover-up. He accused the president's lawyer, Pat Cipollone, of basically trying to make it as if he had done something that was unethical. He was representing his client. And then he makes the statement on the floor of the United States Senate when he says executive privilege and other nonsense. These are constitutional privileges recognized by the Supreme Court, and by the way, overwhelmingly recognized by the Supreme Court. Executive privilege, which has been applied in multiple administrations, dates all the way back to our founding, actually. And to be that cavalier on the floor of the Senate, albeit it was late at night, and so emotions were a little high. I've appeared before John Roberts before, of course, and I have known John Roberts. He is doing a great job as the presiding officer of the Senate. He basically said, lower the temperature down. But I'm going to tell you something, when they accuse my client on the floor of the Senate or they accuse senators of not being able to keep their oath and not being truthful and being involved in the coverup, we are going to say something. We're going to have to respond even on the floor of the United States Senate.\n\nBAIER: Now I want you to look forward, because this is something you haven't done. In the House, obviously, in these committee hearings, the president's lawyers were not there. The counterargument was not essentially made. Besides, the Republicans were making it without really witnesses there. How do you structure your arguments going forward, if you can shed some light on that?\n\nSEKULOW: Look, in part, Bret, we are responding to what they are saying, but we're also going to put on an affirmative case, that not only the president was completely legal, completely unconstitutional, perfectly legal, perfectly constitutional, perfectly appropriate. But that the idea that this reaches the level of impeachment legally speaking is rarely absurd. But we are going to put on a series of lawyers that are going to be dealing with the issues on the facts in great detail, on the law and the Constitution. We have got two constitutional law professors, one former solicitor general of the United States with Judge Starr, Alan Dershowitz, of course, professor emeritus from Harvard Law School. We're going to talk about the foundations of what it means to rise to the level of what is impeachable and what is not. We have got a tremendous fact presentation. And look, we're going to be responding also to what goes on in the next few days. That's part of what you have to do when you go second\n\nBAIER: Zero to 10, what is your level of concern, 10 being the highest, and you look at this list of GOP senators potentially who suggested that witnesses may factor in. Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, Lamar Alexander, Cory Gardner, as you look at that list, zero to 10, what is your level of concern that you may have to have witnesses in this Senate trial?\n\nSEKULOW: Look, they're going to have to prove the need for witnesses in the sense that they are presenting all of this information. They've been doing this now for almost two days. I'm not going to predict what the Senate does. I'll tell you this. I'm not concerned about it because I know the facts and I know the law and we have a great team, and we're ready to proceed in any way it goes. I don't believe that it will get to witnesses, but that is going to be the Senate's decision.\n\nBAIER: So I'll take a two?\n\nSEKULOW: You know what, listen, here's how I operate -- prepare for every contingency. We're prepared for every contingency. We're going to put on a strong case. We're going to make the case on why it's not necessary to have witnesses. We're going to talk about what the law requires, and we will deal with whatever the Senate decides and move forward. Our job, and we've been saying this for basically 18 hours, was to get this process started. And it's taken 12 hours to get it even started, and now we're getting started.\n\nBAIER: Jay, we appreciate you taking time and talking to us. I'll put you down for a three and we will follow every element.\n\nBAIER: Thanks, Jay. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. We are going to cover everything on this Senate trial. We have got you covered through the day. We have got you covered through the night. We'll be dipping in and out through our coverage, and each show will handle it. Martha is up next here in Washington. We'll be back tomorrow at 12:00 p.m. And that's it for SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. It's a busy time in Washington, and, oh, yes, the Iowa caucus 12 days away as we look alive on Capitol Hill.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com\n\nAfter the initial outbreak of the coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan, medical professionals have examined what physiological archetypes and age groups might have a greater risk of contracting the disease, in an effort to educate the public.\n\nFox News spoke with Dr. Debra Chew, Assistant Professor of Medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, to gain a better understanding of the virus and how it behaves.\n\n\"Risks of contracting disease is based on epidemiologic exposure -- and therefore exposure to persons infected with the Wuhan Coronavirus, and those ill with respiratory symptoms who have traveled to Wuhan or neighboring cities,\" she said. \"This may expand with more cases and global travel.\"\n\nChew, who completed an Infectious Diseases fellowship at Albert Einstein/Montefiore Medical Center, said it's unclear if pregnant women are at greater risk than others, but confirmed that young people, senior citizens and those with immune deficiencies could have an acute reaction if exposed to the virus.\n\n\"We are not clear if there are other host risks, including risk of transmission to various groups of people including pregnant women and different age groups,\" she said. \"We do know that the young, elderly and those with immuno-compromised host immune system and chronic medical conditions can get more severe illness.\"\n\nTEXAS A&M STUDENT TESTED FOR POSSIBLE CORONAVIRUS EXPOSURE, HAD TRAVELED TO CHINA\n\nAs for the virus having an incubation period, Chew said the timetable is unclear, but estimated that anyone who's been infected should become symptomatic within five days.\n\n\"Generally, coronaviruses as a family have a short incubation period of up to five days, and recent cases with Wuhan Coronavirus is consistent with this,\" she explained. \"CDC [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and WHO [World Health Organization] are actively investigating much more about the virus and illness characteristics.\"\n\nMost coronaviruses cause only mild symptoms, similar to that of the common cold. Other strains, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), can cause pneumonia and death.\n\nIt has been three weeks since Chinese officials announced the outbreak of the new virus. More than 600 people have been sickened and 17 have died since then.\n\nThe coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, began at an animal and seafood market in Wuhan and has spread to several other countries, including the United States. The illness is said to be transferable between humans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSymptoms of the virus include fever, cough and shortness of breath. There aren't many preemptive steps that can be taken to avoid infection, other than practicing basic sanitary measures on a regular basis.\n\nThe CDC recommends washing your hands regularly and avoiding contact with other sick people who are recovering from an illness. They also suggest avoiding touching your eyes and face, along with keeping objects and surfaces in your home or workspace clean and disinfected.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news",

health threat", "body": "The current outbreak in China of Wuhan coronavirus (Wuhan CoV) represents a significant public health challenge.\n\nThe outbreak is rapidly evolving. The number of cases and deaths are increasing. As of Thursday, there were 650 documented cases and 25 deaths.\n\nOur understanding of the virus is also increasing at an unprecedented pace. The genetic sequence of the virus is already known as well as its evolutionary relationship to other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV).\n\nHOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS?\n\nThere are many lessons from SARS and other outbreaks that can help us to understand the current outbreak. It is important to look at both the potential similarities and differences.\n\nFor example, both SARS CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS CoV), a related coronavirus, have bats are their definitive host species and intermediate hosts of palm civets and camels respectively. A similar pattern may be seen for Wuhan CoV.\n\nIt has already been determined that the genetic sequence of Wuhan CoV appears to be most closely related to coronaviruses of bats and snakes. Given that the initial infections were linked to fish and animal markets, it is likely that the key host species will be found there.\n\nLike SARS, the current outbreak is expected to be contained. However, the timeframe for containment cannot be predicted with accuracy.\n\nThe single case in Washington does not pose a significant threat to the general public. However, it is important to be vigilant to possibility of additional cases among international travelers.\n\nMore generally, a single case or even a trickle of cases among international travelers should not lead to fears that Wuhan CoV will break out among the American public.\n\nWe must maintain this statistical perspective in relation to the very real health threats of motor vehicles, misuse of drugs, misuse of firearms, and common infectious diseases.\n\nEveryone can make a difference by ensuring that their own vaccinations for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia are up to date.\n\nWith regard to Wuhan CoV, we should not expect any effective drugs or vaccines in the near future. In the long term, a detailed knowledge of the molecular biology of this virus is likely to produce candidate drugs and vaccines.\n\nEducation is a critical tool.\n\nKey components of an education program include: educating travelers coming to and from China and other regions of Asia that are affected; educating physicians to ensure they will ask appropriate questions about travel history and about common symptoms, so they will utilize appropriate safety precautions, and to apprise them about where to get additional information; educating the news media; and educating the general public.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta have published important recommendations on how to identify and contain people under investigation for infection with Wuhan CoV.\n\nBased on the transmission of SARS coronavirus, these recommendations include the use of \"airborne, droplet and contact precautions\" including the use of gloves, gowns, N95 respirators, and eye protection in the form or goggles or face shields.\n\nIt is critical to stop the outbreak in Asia. The most important way to do this is to facilitate communication and cooperation between all the countries and agencies involved. This is where the majority of our resources should be directed. There are several reasons for focus our efforts on this.\n\nFirst, this will minimize the overall amount of human suffering resulting from this virus.\n\nSecond, this will decrease the probability that new cases may spread to other regions, including the U.S.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThird, this will decrease the opportunity for the virus to evolve into even more virulent forms as it passes through a large susceptible population.\n\nAnd fourth, this increases the probability that Chinese officials will keep us apprised of new developments with this virus as well as future outbreaks.\n\nWhile this virus had spread to several Wuhan hospitals before it came to the attention of the outside world Dec. 30, the delay was far less than was seen with the SARS epidemic. In that case, earlier knowledge of the virus may have facilitated the earlier institution of effective control measures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt is critical to emphasize the importance of maintaining and bolstering the public health infrastructure at the local, national and international levels. This bulwark plays a vital role in detecting, characterizing and containing infectious threats like Wuhan CoV, SARS, Ebola, influenza, and unknown threats that we are to encounter in the future.\n\nMore importantly, in the words of Nobel Prize winner Baruch Blumberg: \"When public health works, nothing happens.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox

the globe turn their attention toward China to monitor the ongoing coronavirus outbreak that's sickened over 500 and killed at least 17 people, at least one company in the U.S. is working to develop a diagnostic tool that aims to mainstream the process of detecting the specific strain of the virus in a patient.\n\nFor now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends health care providers who suspect a patient may be suffering from symptoms of coronavirus order laboratory tests using respiratory specimens and serum to detect coronaviruses. However, there are several coronaviruses with similar genetic sequences, including MERS and SARS, and symptoms reported by the patient may be mistaken for another illness.\n\nDR. OZ REACTS TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: VERY HARD TO 'WALL IT IN' ONCE IT STARTS\n\nThat's why Dwight Egan, Co-Diagnostics chief executive officer, said his company is working to \"rapidly\" develop an accurate diagnostic test to detect 2019-nCoV, and eliminate the chance missed diagnoses.\n\n\"The WHO and CDC have published guidelines that we are utilizing in our design process,\" he said in a statement to Fox News. \"One of the most important advantages of our technology is its ability to accurately differentiate between similar genetic sequences, in order to reduce the likelihood of a false-positive diagnosis. If the outbreak continues, our industry will be an important vehicle for the commercialization and distribution of diagnostics.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK PROMPTS CHINA TO RESTRICT TRAVEL IN ADDITIONAL CITIES\n\nThe virus, which officials determined is transmissible between humans, has popped up in at least five other countries in patients who passed through the Wuhan region. One of the fears is that a patient experiencing the most severe stage of the infection may become a super-spreader or someone who transmits the virus to a considerable more amount of people than the average infected person.\n\nThere are also suspicions that the Chinese government may be downplaying the outbreak, and underreporting the virus after the way the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak was handled by the country. For now, travel restrictions in at least three cities including Wuhan, which is considered the epicenter of the virus outbreak, as well as the indefinite cancelation of major events in Beijing, aiming to stop the virus from spreading any further. In all, 18 million people are estimated to be impacted by the restrictions, as well as millions more who had planned to travel for the Lunar New Year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The situation is still developing and from our perspective, the way that we can be most helpful is to create multiplex diagnostic tests that are affordable in any market in the world,\" Egan told Fox News. \"Our mandate is to be as helpful in a public health crisis as is possible and so we are moving quickly and aggressively to do just that. Our patented process is unique and could meaningfully support and assist other important initiatives being done by the CDC and WHO.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

travelers to continue to \"exercise increased caution\" amid the \"novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan.\"\n\nHOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE CORONAVIRUS\n\nThe travel advisory itself, meanwhile, remains at a Level 2, where it was prior to Jan. 23. Previously, the country was under a Level 2 warning due to \"arbitrary enforcement of local laws and special restrictions on dual U.S.-Chinese citizens.\"\n\nIn its new language, the State Department cited the CDC and its \"Watch Level 3\" alert, which advises that people \"avoid non-essential travel\" to the region.\n\nIn addition, the State Department shared many of the CDC's recommendations for travelers planning to go to Wuhan or those who feel they may have contracted the coronavirus.\n\nHOW THE CORONAVIRUS WILL IMPACT TRAVEL\n\nAmong the recommendations, the CDC and State Department urge travelers to avoid contact with sick people, animals (alive or dead), meat markets, animal markets and uncooked meat. Travelers should also wash hands often (specifically with soap and water, for 20 seconds) and use an alcohol-based sanitizer if water is not immediately available. Additional guidelines can be found at the State Department and CDC's websites.\n\nA spokesperson for the State Department further reiterated that the current travel advisory level for China did not change but rather the language of the travel advisory, which now includes additional information about the outbreak.\n\n\"Today, we updated the China Travel Advisory to include additional information on the coronavirus outbreak,\" said spokesperson in a statement. \"The Advisory remains a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution.
