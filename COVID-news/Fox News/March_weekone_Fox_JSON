Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nPresident Trump has directed his quarterly salary be used by the Department of Health and Human Services in the effort to combat the coronavirus outbreak, the White House said Tuesday.\n\nThe quarterly salary, $100,000, will be donated to \"confront, contain and combat\" the disease, press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted Tuesday.\n\nThe president has pledged his quarterly salary away to various government agencies. Last quarter, he donated the $100,000 to fight the opioid crisis and before that, to Homeland Security, Transportation and Veterans Affairs.\n\nLast week the White House asked Congress for $2.5 billion in supplemental spending to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. The request included $1.25 billion in new money, with the rest coming from unspent funds. The measure would help the federal government, as well as state and local agencies, potentially prepare to respond to an outbreak and allocate cash for vaccine development, a senior administration official told Fox Business.\n\nCDC UPDATING CORONAVIRUS CASES DAILY, NO LONGER REPORTING 'PATIENTS UNDER INVESTIGATION'\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has already tapped into an emergency infectious disease response fund and has been attempting to transfer more than $130 million from other HHS accounts.\n\nThe funding would reimburse the Pentagon, which has been housing evacuees from China for their 14-day quarantine at several military bases in California.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe U.S. so far has suffered nine fatalities and 118 confirmed cases.",

"President Trump addresses U.S coronavirus cases ahead of meeting at National Institute of Health.\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday said his administration is moving forward with withholding funding from sanctuary cities after an appeals court ruled that such a move was legal - part of a broad push by the administration to end the controversial policies that it says makes Americans less safe.\n\n\"As per recent Federal Court ruling, the Federal Government will be withholding funds from Sanctuary Cities. They should change their status and go non-Sanctuary,\" he said. \"Do not protect criminals!\"\n\nCOURT HANDS TRUMP WIN IN SANCTUARY CITY FIGHT, SAYS ADMINISTRATION CAN DENY GRANT MONEY\n\nThe 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York last month overturned a lower court ruling that stopped the administration's 2017 move to withhold grant money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, which dispenses over $250 million a year to state and local criminal justice efforts.\n\nThe decision conflicts with rulings from other appeals courts across the country concerning sanctuary policies, indicating a Supreme Court review is ultimately likely.\n\nNew York City and liberal states, including New York, Washington, Massachusetts and Connecticut, sued the government, and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York backed them - ordering the money be released and stopping the government from putting immigration-related conditions on grants.\n\nBut the appeals court ruled that it \"cannot agree that the federal government must be enjoined from imposing the challenged conditions on the federal grants here at issue.\"\n\nSanctuaries policies limit local cooperation with immigration authorities and bar law enforcement from complying with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers - requests that ICE be alerted when an illegal immigrant is being released from local custody.\n\nDE BLASIO IGNORING ICE PLEAS FOR COOPERATION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRIMINALS, OFFICIAL SAYS\n\nProponents of sanctuary cities have argued that it makes communities safer by encouraging illegal immigrant victims of crime or witnesses to cooperate with law enforcement.\n\n\"The Trump administration's scare tactics destroy trust in law enforcement. The day our police ask for immigration status is the day people stop reporting crimes and sharing information. It's the day we stop being the safest big city in America. We won't let that happen,\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said in January.\n\nBut administration officials have pointed to a host of cases when an illegal immigrant has been sprung from custody after a detainer was ignored and gone on to re-offend.\n\nIn a letter to de Blasio last month, ICE Acting Director Matt Albence noted that ICE's New York City Enforcement and Removals Office issued detainers on 7,526 subjects who had criminal histories, including 3,500 assaults, 1,500 DUIs, 1,000 sex crimes, 1,000 weapons offenses, 500 robberies and 200 homicides.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe administration has deployed elite Border Patrol agents to sanctuary cities to help ICE track down and detain illegal immigrants.\n\nThe Justice Department recently announced a slew of measures, and Trump has called on Congress to pass legislation that would allow victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants to sue sanctuary cities and states.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com",

with President Trump on Thursday was the most-watched election town hall in cable news history, according to early Nielsen media research.\n\nThe event co-moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum averaged 4.2 million viewers from 6:30-7:30 p.m. ET. The record-setting town hall dominated cable news, topping MSNBC's 1.4 million viewers and CNN's 1 million viewers combined.\n\nFOX NEWS TO HOST BERNIE SANDERS TOWN HALL WITH BRET BAIER, MARTHA MACCALLUM\n\nFox News also beat CNN and MSNBC combined in the key news demographic of adults age 25-54, averaging 744,000 during the town hall.\n\nTrump, speaking with Baier and MacCallum in Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pa., suggested that the new Democratic front-runner's repeated gaffes could be a sign of a competency issue -- honing a line of attack that Republicans are expected to repeatedly deploy if Biden becomes his party's nominee.\n\nThe town hall covered an array of other topics, including stock market turbulence and deregulation. Out of the gate, Trump defended his administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying his decision to limit travel from China had averted a broader domestic crisis.\n\nMSNBC'S BRIAN WILLIAMS, NY TIMES EDITOR MARVEL AT TWEET THAT GOT BLOOMBERG MATH REALLY WRONG\n\nTrump also wasted little time in criticizing ex-rival Elizabeth Warren's decision to drop out of the race only after Super Tuesday, saying she may have sabotaged Sen. Bernie Sanders' struggling presidential bid by siphoning the progressive vote.\n\nFNC's first town hall of the election cycle with Trump brought in double the audience of the same time slot from the first quarter of 2019. It also attracted another 2 million viewers during the encore presentation of Trump's town hall at 11 p.m. ET.\n\nThe setting was more casual and conversational than Trump's boisterous rallies, and afforded the commander in chief an opportunity to connect directly with voters on camera. The event was Trump's first discussion with Baier and Martha MacCallum since interviews in June 2018 and April 2017.\n\nFox News Media President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace announced on Friday that the network will host a second town hall event with Sanders on Monday in Detroit.\n\nBaier and MacCallum will also moderate the Sanders event, as they did when the 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful participated in a town hall on Fox News back in April 2019.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Sanders event will be the 11th town hall of the current election season hosted by Fox News and the 10th with a Democratic presidential candidate. FNC's first town hall with Sanders holds the record for the most-watched town hall of the Democrats' 2020 election cycle with nearly 2.6 million viewers.\n\nFNC also topped MSNBC and CNN during the primetime hours of 8-11 p.m. ET on Thursday, averaging 3.9 million viewers. MSNBC averaged 2.4 million viewers over that same time period while CNN managed only 1.5 million.\n\nFox News recently celebrated its 18th consecutive year as the most-watched cable news network, dating back to January 2002. FNC's 18-year streak is for both primetime and total-day viewers, including the key demographic of adults age 25-54.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"},

The majority of 1,150 cases throughout the Middle East are linked back to the country.\n\nIran was preparing the possibility of testing \"tens of thousands\" of people following a spike of cases on Saturday.\n\nThe country has closed schools and universities due to COVID-19, but religious Shiite shrines have remained open.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\n\n\"I think financial markets will bounce back,\" Trump said as markets were down over 700 points already Friday morning. \"They were up 70 percent so it's a relatively small piece.

But people don't like her. She's a very mean person... People don't want that. They like a person like me, that's not mean.\"\n\nTrump also slammed the Federal Reserve for not taking actions similar to what other central banks around the world have done.\n\n\"We're going to see whether or not the Fed wants to stimulate.

On Super Tuesday, March 3, she walked away with two delegates from American Samoa, which would have helped her qualify in the previous debate, held Feb. 25 in Charleston, S.C.\n\nHowever, the DNC released a new requirement for the March 15 Phoenix debate. Participants for that contest must have at least 20 percent of the pledged delegates, which means only the two leaders -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- qualify.\n\n'THE VIEW' LAUGHS OFF TULSI GABBARD AFTER SHE WON DELEGATE ON SUPER TUESDAY: 'PUT A FORK IN IT!'\n\nOn Friday night, Gabbard took to social media and appealed to Biden and Sanders to let her join them on the debate stage once again.\n\n\"@JoeBiden @Bernie Sanders I'm sure you would agree that our Democratic nominee should be a person who will stand up for what is right. So I ask that you have the courage to do that now in the face of the DNC's effort to keep me from participating in the debates,\" Gabbard tweeted.\n\nShe then called out the DNC for changing the debate requirements to allow Mike Bloomberg onto the debate stage.\n\n\"To keep me off the stage, the DNC again arbitrarily changed the debate qualifications. Previously they changed the qualifications in the OPPOSITE direction so Bloomberg could debate. I ask that you stand w/ me against the DNC's transparent effort to exclude me from the debates. #LetTulsiDebate,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe hashtag #LetTulsiDebate trended on Twitter throughout Friday evening.\n\nGabbard has not appeared on at a Democratic debate since November.
