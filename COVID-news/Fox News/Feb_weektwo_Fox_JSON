Bernie Sanders of Vermont now considered the front-runner in the race for the Democratic nomination, concern and resistance is growing among mainstream and establishment Democrats inside and outside the nation's capital.\n\nModerate lawmakers sounded the alarm bells Thursday, Fox News' Chad Pergram and Marisa Schultz reported from Capitol Hill. \"It's bad,\" one freshman Democrat from a swing district said. \"We are having conversations about how to deal with this.\"\n\n\"If [Sanders] is the nominee, we lose,\" another Democrat told Fox News.\n\nTwo other vulnerable Democrats said a Sanders nomination would almost certainly cede their states to President Trump and could hurt their down-ballot races for the House and Senate.

Senior DOJ leaders then intervened and adjusted the sentencing recommendation downward, saying it was clearly excessive given Stone's obstruction-related offenses. All four prosecutors on the case stepped down within hours.\n\n\"I think it's time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\" Barr said. \"I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody ... whether it's Congress, a newspaper editorial board, or the president.\"\n\nBarr continued, \"I'm gonna do what I think is right, and you know ...

"title": "Coronavirus cases exceed 64K globally, death toll nears 1,400 in China", "body": "U.S. confirms 15th case of coronavirus; Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in.\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases diagnosed in China continued to surge Friday after the country reported 5,000 more people diagnosed with the virus while the government reportedly enforced \"wartime\" measures in additional cities in Hubei province.\n\nThe National Health Commission announced 121 more people had died from the virus. The report comes after 14,840 new cases were reported a day earlier thanks to a new approach to testing. The Washington Post reported that the \"wartime\" approach means citizens in some areas are barred from leaving their homes.\n\nRoughly 60 percent of Friday's cases were determined by the new method, which takes into account a physician's diagnosis before the infected are confirmed in a lab test.\n\nDespite an increase in cases in Hubei province, the World Health Organization (WHO) says they are not rising dramatically outside of China.\n\n\"This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,\" said Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of WHO's health emergency programme.\n\nPaul Hunter, a professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom suspects the trend is still downwards.\n\n\"It almost certainly does not mean that there has been a resurgence of the epidemic overnight,\" Hunter said.\n\nDR. MARC SIEGEL: 'I'M BECOMING MORE CONCERNED' ABOUT CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\nChina has suffered the most thus far from the virus with 99 percent of the cases. The U.S. has 15 patients including, eight in California, one in Texas, one in Wisconsin, one in Arizona, one in Washington state, one in Massachusetts and two in Illinois. No deaths have been reported in the U.S.\n\nA new case was discovered in Texas from an evacuee who arrived in a State Department chartered flight from Wuhan, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday.\n\nCDC officials added there will \"likely be additional cases in the coming days and weeks, including among other people recently returned from Wuhan.\"\n\nThe U.S. had announced that Americans who traveled to China within the last 14 days would be sent to designated airports for enhanced screenings. Foreign nationals who recently went to China would be denied entry in the U.S., except for the immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry had said the U.S. hasn't given the country any substantive help in its fight against the coronavirus outbreak. They added the U.S. was contributing to the international panic surrounding the illness, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nThe WHO declared the outbreak a global emergency as it spreads to countries outside of China and the number of infected patients continues to grow.\n\nCAMBODIA TAKES IN CRUISE SHIP PASSENGERS REJECTED FROM OTHER COUNTRIES OVER CORONAVIRUS FEARS\n\nCountries around the globe have increased travel restrictions to the infected mainland China and Hubei province -- with the U.S. State Department increasing its advisory to level 4: \"Do Not Travel.\"\n\nThe CDC has advised travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country.\n\nCoronavirus has now killed almost twice the amount of people in China than were sickened during the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. The SARS outbreak had killed 349 people in mainland China back in 2002 and 2003 -- with 744 deaths and 8,096 infections globally, according to the CDC.\n\nThe virus has claimed the lives of 1,383 people and infected 64,366 around the globe. Only three people have died outside of China.\n\nJapan announced its first coronavirus death on Thursday. The 80-year-old woman had been in the hospital near Toyko since Feb. 1 after being diagnosed with pneumonia. The news occurred hours after Japan confirmed 44 more infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined outside Toyko.\n\nTHE 5 DEADLIEST DISEASE EPIDEMICS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\nThe other deaths were in Hong Kong and the Philippines.\n\nThe WHO said the number of cases will keep growing as tests are pending on thousands of suspected cases.\n\nWhere is the virus?\n\nRoughly 99 percent of new cases have appeared in China with the vast majority of the cases in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan -- the epicenter of the virus.\n\nOver 515 cases have been reported in at least 25 countries globally. Europe's total is at 46.\n\nJapan -- 28 (218 passengers on Diamond Princess cruise ship outside Yokohama) (1 death)\n\nThe flu has estimated to have killed roughly 10,000 to 25,000 people with nearly 19 to 26 million infected in the U.S. between October 1, 2019, and January 25, 2020, according to the CDC. Coronavirus has impacted a far lesser number, although it's not yet clear how many have been infected or how widespread it is.\n\nThere have also been reports it can be spread without symptoms showing up. In respiratory illnesses, people with the most symptoms are the most contagious, the agency said. Children and those over 65 are the most likely to get sick from the flu, the CDC added.\n\nUnlike the coronavirus, there's a seasonal vaccine for the flu. People over six months out are advised by the agency to get it during annual vaccination, with certain rare exceptions, such as severe allergies to the shot.\n\nA DEAN KOONTZ BOOK FROM 1981 PREDICTED CORONAVIRUS IN BIZARRE COINCIDENCE\n\nNo vaccine has been developed for coronavirus as of yet, which makes it dangerous in that respect.\n\nHow did it start?\n\nIt's not entirely clear how it started, but Chinese scientists believe the virus may have originated in bats. The pangolin, a type of scaly anteater was reported to be a possible host, according to a Chinese University. A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that genome sequences from seven patients tested were identical to the bat coronavirus.\n\nHow does it transmit?\n\nIt's believed the normal coronavirus can be transmitted most commonly through respiratory droplets in the air, as well as close contact with an infected person or touching areas contaminated with the virus before washing. The digestive tract may also transmit the disease, according to scientists from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Science.\n\nHOW IS CORONAVIRUS TRANSMITTED?\n\nThey recently discovered \"virus genetic material\" in feces samples and rectal swabs from some patients, Chinese state media reported.\n\nWhat are the current travel restrictions?\n\nThe U.S. declared the coronavirus a public health emergency with Trump signing an order barring entry to foreign nationals who recently were in China, other than the immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.\n\nOfficials at the CDC have advised travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country. The U.S. State Department raised its China travel advisory to \"Level 4: Do Not Travel.\"\n\n\"Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus,\" The advisory said.\n\nVietnam stopped all flights to and from China.\n\nCORONAVIRUS TRAVEL BAN, STRICT INFECTION CONTROL WILL KEEP VIRUS AT BAY IN US, FORMER NY OFFICIAL SAYS\n\nJapan, Singapore, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia all have similar policies to the U.S. on restricting non-citizens.\n\nMongolia and Singapore have shut their borders.\n\nSingapore said it would ban travelers from China's Hubei province.\n\nPakistan says they're halting all flights to and from China\n\nThe United Kingdom and New Zealand advised their people against nonessential travel to China.\n\nRussia has signed an order to close the border between them and China. They also blocked tour groups from China.\n\nRUSSIAN WOMAN WHO ESCAPED HOSPITAL CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE LOCKS HERSELF IN HOME, REPORT SAYS\n\nChina has cut off access to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, trapping more than 50 million people\n\nHong Kong quarantining visitors from mainland China\n\nJapan bars foreign nationals who had been to Hubei province.\n\nCarnival and Royal Caribbean denying boarding of people who travel to China within 14 days.\n\nItaly suspended all flights to China.\n\nSouth Korea urged an increase in its level of caution to \"restraint\" when traveling to China.\n\nHong Kong reduced half its flights and shut down rail service to mainland China.\n\nCathay Pacific Airways asks 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave.\n\nDelta suspended all service to China.\n\nJAMES CARAFANO: NORTH KOREA'S CORONAVIRUS PROBLEM AND HOW THEIR SECRECY WILL MAKE IT WORSE\n\nUnited Airlines suspends all flights between China and the U.S.\n\nUnited's pilots, concerned for their safety, were able to drop trips to China without pay, a union memo said, according to Reuters.\n\nAmerican Airlines suspends all flights to China.\n\nThe Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents 15,000 pilots for American Airlines filed a lawsuit to halt service with the airline, citing \"serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus.\"\n\n\"I am directing all APA pilots to cease flight operations between the United States and China,\" said APA president Eric Ferguson. \"Until further notice, if you are scheduled, assigned, or reassigned a pairing into China, decline the assignment by calling your Chief Pilot or IOC Duty Pilot. Inform them you are declining in accordance with the CDC and WHO declarations.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS NURSES IN CHINA ARE SHAVING THEIR HEADS TO 'IMPROVE EFFICIENCY'\n\nBritish Airways suspended all flights

said.\n\nIf a doctor determines a patient to be \"a person under suspicion\" for the virus, a nasal or throat swab is then performed to obtain a sample.\n\nIn rare cases, doctors may also try to get mucus from hard-to-reach parts of the respiratory tract, which may involve intubation or spraying saline mist into the lungs, Kohl said.\n\n\"If there's not enough of [a sample] we might need to go

Governor of New York, Dr. Betsy McCaughey, weighs in on the new travel restrictions enacted by the Trump administration to halt the spread of the coronavirus, and risks the U.S. faces if this epidemic makes its way into the country.\n\nThe former lieutenant governor of New York has hit back at China for keeping the true depths of the coronavirus spread under wraps for so long, which possibly allowed for thousands to travel while infectious. Dr. Betsy McCaughey, current chairman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths, told Fox News that even this week, the country was making a mistake in being reluctant to accept foreign help.\n\n\"The first thing China did wrong was to keep it a secret for so long,\" McCaughey said. \"It meant that hundreds of thousands of people perhaps traveled around the world from China who could be carrying this virus and nobody knew about it.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS PATIENT TOOK UBER TO LONDON EMERGENCY ROOM\n\nThe virus has since spread to more than 60,000 people and killed more than 1,000. The majority of cases and fatalities have occurred mainly in China. As a result, similar to other foreign nations, the Trump administration has issued travel restrictions for foreigners coming to the U.S. and for Americans returning from regions in China that are being pummeled by the virus. Some, however, have criticized the administration's move and warned that it could further alienate Asian cultures and help spread unnecessary fear.\n\n\"This is a virus that happened to pop up in China,\" Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., recently told Politico. \"But the virus doesn't discriminate between Asian versus non-Asian. In our response, we can't create prejudices and harbor anxieties toward one population.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS EVACUEE IN TEXAS DIAGNOSED WITH VIRUS, MARKING 15TH CASE IN US: CDC\n\nBut McCaughey applauded the restrictions and strict quarantines and said it was a \"very smart step\" to prevent the coronavirus from becoming widespread in the U.S., which has already seen 15 confirmed cases of the illness. Most of the cases have involved patients who recently traveled to China.\n\n\"They've done two things: They've said, 'If you're an American and you're returning from China, you must be quarantined or self-quarantined -- or if you've been in that particular province where coronavirus is focused, you must be in a quarantine facility,'\" McCaughey said. \"And secondly, the Trump administration has barred foreign travelers who have been in China recently from coming to the U.S., and that is very important because our hospitals are not ready to prevent the spread of coronavirus once it becomes endemic here.\"\n\nAbout 600 Americans who were evacuated from the virus epicenter are in quarantine at military bases in California, Nebraska and Texas. McCaughey said it's much easier to fight the outbreak in China with foreign aid and medical supplies than it would be if it were to become widespread in the U.S.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE FOX HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\n\"Let me just point out that in our country, 75,000 people a year die from infections they contract in the hospital,\" she said. \"Almost all of them are bacterial infections, which are easier to control than a viral infection like coronavirus. If hospitals can't protect you from MRSA and C. diff and VRC and all these commonplace infections, how are they ever going to protect you from coronavirus? They're not.\"\n\nMcCaughey said the U.S. should focus on tightening infection control in hospitals, and that all staff should be armed with masks, gowns, gloves and other medical protection should the coronavirus become widespread.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The safety of Americans, in this case, will depend on what happens when a traveler unknowingly carrying this disease goes to an emergency room for help,\" she said. \"If the hospital has rigorous infection control in place, the disease will not spread. But too many of our hospitals are very lax about infection control.

It's an apt metaphor for what we know about what's going inside the DPRK now: Nada.\n\nThat absence of information poses a real problem when a global health threat is on the loose. And the coronavirus is most definitely a global threat.\n\nThough we can only guess what's going on in Kim's dark kingdom, it's hard to imagine a rosy scenario.\n\nNORTH KOREA 'CLEARLY LYING' ABOUT CORONAVIRUS CASES, EXPERT SAYS\n\nWhat we do know is that the government in Pyongyang has announced that its border with China is closed. Is the virus already across? Will it find its way in any way? Even if the correct answer to both questions is \"no,\" North Korea still has a problem. Lack of trade and travel, even a temporary ban, will further cripple the economy of what is already the poorest country on earth. The bottom line: Starving North Koreans will starve more.\n\nOdds are that North Korea can tough it out in the short term. Flu season should abate in April. The contagion will then be less of a concern, at least until the autumn. The North Korean people have been through worse.\n\nIf the coronavirus does spread to the DPRK, that's a different set of problems. On the one hand, the best way to deal with a global pandemic is transparency; sharing information can help all nations to develop the most efficacious response. China has been very bad with transparency. North Korea would be worse.\n\nOn the bright side -- at least for those of us not trapped in Kim's domain -- North Korea has nothing remotely close to the social mobility available in China. Further, if the government decides to crack down further, implementing quarantine and even more travel restrictions, you can bet they'll be enforced. Ruthlessly. Brutal dictatorships are good at that sort of thing.\n\nBut, as noted above, North Koreans are tough. They have suffered through decades of deprivation and pain -- mostly at the hands of the regime in Pyongyang. So, they likely survive this.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nStill, if the virus gets loose in North Korea, it will be hellish. Most North Koreans are malnourished, and malnourished people have depressed immune systems. People with depressed immune systems are more likely to get the flu and more likely to be debilitated by it.\n\nWhat will happen to the sick? The state of North Korea's healthcare is thought to be pretty appalling. The sick will die.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShould there be a widespread outbreak in North Korea, and if the regime admits it, civilized nations will want to pony-up international aid. That aid, quite literally, would make the difference between life and death for countless Koreans.\n\nBut until we know what's going on in North Korea, there's really nothing we can do for them. In the meanwhile, we can best spend our effort cooperating with the rest of the world in limiting the spread of the virus.

The lab is ironically located in Wuhan, China and the made-up virus is called Wuhan-400.\n\nIn the novel, the virus is called the \"perfect weapon\" because it only affects humans.

name to help avoid the stigmatization of the disease.\n\nTokyo Olympic organizers reiterated their message on Thursday at the start of two days of meetings with the International Olympic Committee: The 2020 Games will not be waylaid by the virus that is spreading from neighboring China.\n\n\"I would like to make it clear again that we are not considering a cancellation or postponement of the games. Let me make that clear,\" organizing committee president Yoshiro Mori said, speaking through an interpreter to dozens of top IOC officials gathered in Tokyo.\n\nThe Olympics open in just over five months, and the torch relay begins next month in Japan -- a clear signal the games are getting close.\n\nAlthough there have been no deaths in Japan attributed to the coronavirus, Tokyo and IOC officials are clearly jittery. Sitting among the officials this time was Dr. Richard Budgett, the IOC's medical and scientific director.\n\nLast week Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the Tokyo organizing committee, said he was \"seriously worried that the spread of the infectious disease could throw cold water on the momentum toward the games.\"\n\nHe backed down a day later and said he was confident the games would go forward, which is the message this time.\n\nOn Wednesday, the virus forced the cancellation of a Formula One race set for April in Shanghai, which draws more than 100,000 over a race weekend.\n\nThe Hong Kong and Singapore rounds of the World Rugby Sevens Series were rescheduled from April to October on Thursday, with organizers saying the decision was taken \"in response to continued health concerns relating to\" the outbreak of the virus. Also, t he SportAccord conference, an event with close ties to the Olympic movement, will not take place in Beijing in April as scheduled, organizers said Thursday.\n\nThe virus has also wiped out the indoor world track and field championships in Nanjing, golf tournaments, soccer matches, and almost all sports in China, including Olympic qualifying events. It is also keeping Chinese athletes from traveling to qualify, which could put their presence in Tokyo in jeopardy.\n\nSaburo Kawabuchi, a former Olympian and the so-called mayor of the Olympic Village that will house 11,000 athletes and thousands more staff members, suggested Tokyo's hot and humid summer would stop the virus.\n\n\"The biggest concern is the coronavirus and the infection,\" he said, speaking in Japanese. \"Currently we don't have any clue when this issue will be resolved. Based on various pieces of information we receive, it seems that this virus is not as strong as the influenza virus. The virus is susceptible to humidity and heat. In Japan, we have the rainy season which could defeat the virus.\"\n\nJohn Coates, an IOC member who heads the regular inspection visits to Tokyo, said he expected to receive reports on the virus from the Japanese government, the Tokyo city government, and local organizers in order to see the \"necessary precautions that are being taken.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news",

50,000 confirmed cases and 1,300 people have died from it worldwide; Foreign affair correspondent Benjamin Hall reports.\n\nThe coronavirus has infected more than 60,000 people across 26 countries after first being discovered in China's Hubei Province, and yet North Korea, which shares a border with the country where more than 59,000 of those cases and over 1,360 deaths have been reported, claims it does not have a single illness.\n\nUnverified reports about a quarantined person allegedly being executed by the country after visiting a public bath have emerged, as well as a potential first confirmed case, but the government remains steadfast in denying that the virus has reached its borders, which many experts have cast doubt on.\n\nCORONAVIRUS EVACUEE IN TEXAS DIAGNOSED WITH VIRUS, MARKING 15TH CASE IN US: CDC\n\n\"There is no way that North Korea is not being impacted by the coronavirus -- they are clearly lying as they don't want to show any weakness or that there is any threat to the regime,\" Harry Kazianis, director of Korean Studies at the Center for National Interest, told Fox News. \"Considering how there are many porous sections of the North Korea-China border -- and how the Kim regime depends on illegal trade to survive -- it is clear the virus has come to North Korea.\"\n\nLast week, health ministry official Song In Bom told state media that there are no cases of the virus -- which has been named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) -- in the country, but that they would be prepared in the event that the outbreak spread.\n\n\"Just because there is no case of the new coronavirus in our country, we should not be too relieved, but have civil awareness and work together for prevention,\" he said, according to Reuters.\n\nBut Nagi Shafik, former project manager for WHO in Pyongyang, told the South China Morning Post that the country would be ill-equipped to deal with such an outbreak, and would likely lack proper safety gear and medical equipment.\n\nSOME CORONAVIRUS TESTING KITS ARE DEFECTIVE, CDC SAYS\n\n\"I presume there are more items needed, especially when it comes to cleaning and sterilization,\" he told SCMP.com. \"May I remind as well that many women and children suffer from malnutrition; these are factors that affect the immunity system and render humans more susceptible to infection.\"\n\nKazianis also said that the country's fragile health care system would be overwhelmed if the outbreak swept through the nation, and that \"millions of everyday citizens would be essentially left to die.\"\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE FOX HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\n\"North Korea's health care system is devoid of the most basic treatments for any sort of medical problem,\" he said. \"Things like antibiotics, any sort of preventative care are unheard of in the countryside or rural areas and only reserved for the party elite in Pyongyang.\"\n\nSo far, North Korea has banned all tourists and cut off transportation links with China in an effort to stave off the illness. It's also enacted a 30-day quarantine period and said \"all the institutions and fields of the state and foreigners staying in the DPRK should obey it unconditionally.\"\n\nBut cutting the country off from the rest of the world is dangerous, as is withholding the truth about the virus in order to preserve Kim's reputation, Kazianis said.\n\n\"The real danger is if the situation were to spiral out of control and some sort of government collapse occurred,\" he said. \"While I would say the chances are remote, this is the real danger that we must worry about when it comes to North Korea. If the Kim regime did collapse, from coronavirus or something else, who controls their nuclear weapons? What about their chemical or biological weapons? Who feeds the 25 million North Koreans?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"North Korea will always be a threat, and if the state collapsed we would be dealing with a crisis of epic

"title": "Lew Olowski: Coronavirus worse than reported - here's how China is catching up to reality", "body": "China's novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has killed and infected more people than officially reported.\n\nConsider the latest numbers. In one day, total reported infections and deaths increased 44 percent and 23 percent, respectively. But not \"because of any change in the shape of the outbreak,\" which is nonetheless growing near-exponentially. Rather, it was merely because \"the government changed the criteria by which it tracks confirmed cases.\"\n\nThe official tally has been an underestimate and is still catching up to reality. As of Saturday, more than 1,500 people had reportedly died of the virus, with more than 69,000 cases reported worldwide. About 99 percent of the cases have been reported in China.\n\nJAMES CARAFANO: NORTH KOREA'S CORONAVIRUS PROBLEM AND HOW THEIR SECRECY WILL MAKE IT WORSE\n\nEven before the adjustment, circumstances suggested weeks ago that \"the outbreak is spreading far beyond the official count of cases.\"\n\nMany causes contribute to this undercounting.\n\nFirst, the prevailing diagnostic test for COVID-19 may be only 30 to 40 percent accurate. Some carriers who took the diagnostic test were falsely cleared and erroneously excluded from the official tally.\n\nSecond, the diagnostic test itself is scarce. Tests are rationed for the most obviously symptomatic patients. But carriers can be asymptomatic. And they can be contagious before they even show signs of infection.\n\nThird, Chinese hospitals have been overwhelmed with patients. Some people were turned away at the door. Others waited in day-long triage. The sickest may have been too weak to even attempt a hospital visit. Others were deterred from treatment by the wait times and shortages, so they self-quarantined. Yet only those who obtained medical treatment and also tested positive for the virus were included in the official tally.\n\nFourth, resources and public attention have concentrated on Wuhan, a city of 11 million, where the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. However, tens of millions more live in Wuhan's surrounding province, Hubei, which is less equipped with healthcare services. To the extent uncounted cases exist in Wuhan, more uncounted cases exist in Wuhan's exurbs.\n\nIn order for China's ruling Communist Party to have responded to COVID-19 this drastically, the death toll would first have had to exceed local officials' capacity to cover it up, and then also convinced the nation's top officials that it represents an existential threat.\n\nFifth, on top of these logistical challenges, politics also prevents an accurate appraisal. China's communist government is a totalitarian, one-party state. The party justifies its monopoly by promising social stability and economic growth. News of an outbreak threatens both objectives, so the party has an existential interest in suppressing bad news.\n\n\"Political issues are at any time the most fundamental major issues,\" said Hubei governor Wang Xiaodong.\n\nFor example, Dr. Li Wenliang noticed the virus in his hospital before it was publicly reported. He told his colleagues to take extra precautions.\n\nSo when government authorities learned of Dr. Li's discovery, they did not contain the virus. They contained Dr. Li, instead. He was arrested and forced to sign a false confession for spreading \"rumors.\" Officially, there was no virus.\n\nDr. Li died of COVID-19 several weeks later.\n\nMeanwhile, two others who also exposed the virus's impact, Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin, were uploading videos from inside Wuhan. Government authorities tracked them down and disappeared them. Chen's family believes he was detained in quarantine with COVID-19 carriers, even though he appeared healthy.\n\nFor decades, China's communist party has treated dissidents like an \"evil\" virus to be isolated and eliminated. Victims include a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and human rights activists guilty of merely appealing to China's own laws for relief from abusive officials. The party shoots the messenger.\n\nIn this environment, censorship is the rule. Dissenters are the exception.\n\nThe severity of the Chinese government's actual response to COVID-19 is a more reliable indicator than the disease's publicly acknowledged tally. While admitting to just 17 deaths from the virus, the party quarantined a region of about 60 million people. This decision guaranteed multibillion-dollar economic losses.\n\nIt is inconceivable that the Chinese government would wilfully suffer such a cost for the sake of a few dozen -- or even a few hundred -- lives.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe party is generally insensitive to public health. Air pollution contributes to roughly 1.6 million deaths per year. About half the country's water is too polluted to touch. Food poisoning is routine; infants have starved to death when their parents relied on counterfeit baby formula. Approximately a quarter-million people per year die in traffic accidents, partly because perverse incentives in tort law make it cheaper for a negligent driver to kill a pedestrian than to cripple one.\n\nIn order for the party to have responded to COVID-19 this drastically, the death toll would first have had to exceed local officials' capacity to cover it up, and then also convinced the nation's top officials that it represents an existential threat.\n\nAfter all, before coronavirus, the biggest story out of China was its gulag-style network of detention camps where Uighur people are concentrated because of their religion and ethnicity.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe party of Mao Zedong did not suddenly experience a \"come to Pasteur\" moment while it was in the middle of committing a possible genocide.\n\nThis does not suggest the Chinese government is wrong to take extreme measures against COVID-19. To the contrary, it suggests the problem is even worse than the party admits.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Chinese presence", "body": "At least 218 people are infected with coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan; Claudia Cowan reports.\n\nTokyo Olympic organizers and the International Olympic Committee said Friday there is no \"Plan B\" for the 2020 Games, which open in just over five months and have been jolted by the outbreak of a virus in neighboring China.\n\nThe coronavirus has infected almost 64,000 people globally with almost 1,400 deaths in China, but only one in Japan where fear is rising with so much attention focused on the outbreak.\n\n\"Certainly the advice we're received externally from the WHO (World Health Organization) is that there's no case for any contingency plans or cancelling the games or moving the games,\" John Coates, the head of an IOC inspection team, said to wrap up a two-day visit that was dominated by the virus issue.\n\nCoates and Tokyo Olympic organizers took 11 questions at a news conference on Friday. All 11 were about the virus, or the presence of Chinese athletes in 19 remaining test events in Japan, or about Chinese fans, or repeated questions seeking reassurance the games will go ahead as planned.\n\nA Japanese reporter asked Tokyo organizing committee President Yoshiro Mori if, given the fact the games are going ahead, would there be any \"organizational changes\" in how the games are run.\n\n\"No, at this stage, no. We are not thinking of any such possibility,\" said Mori, a former Japanese prime minister, speaking in Japanese.\n\nMori, Coates and CEO Toshiro Muto looked glum sitting at a head table taking essentially the same question over and over.\n\n\"We can confirm that Tokyo 2020 remains on track,\" Coates said in his opening statement.\n\nCoates was asked by a CNN reporter if he was 100% confident that the Tokyo Olympics would go on as scheduled and open on July 24.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied.\n\nCoates talked positively about keeping a close watch on Chinese athletes, and talked optimistically about their eventual presence in Tokyo, where they would probably field a team of 600 athletes -- one of the largest delegations.\n\n\"We continue also to monitor, particularly the Chinese that will be coming here,\" Coates said. \"You'll find that the Chinese teams are mostly out of China. That's the athletes and officials.\"\n\nHe didn't offer any specific numbers.\n\nOthers away from the Olympic circle are uncertain what course the virus outbreak will take.\n\n\"Frankly speaking, there is no guarantee that the outbreak will come to an end before the Olympics because we have no scientific basis to be able to say that,\" Shigeru Omi, a former regional director of the WHO and an infectious disease expert from Japan, said Thursday.\n\n\"So it is meaningless to predict a timing when it may come to an end,\" he added. \"We should assume that the virus has already been spreading in Japan. People should understand that we cannot only rely on border controls to prevent the spread of the disease.\"\n\nMark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, told The Associated Press in an email: \"I don't think anyone right now can confidently predict the state of affairs come late summer.\"\n\n\"One slight word of caution,\" he added. \"Influenza is regarded as a winter infection in the northern hemisphere. But when we encountered a new strain in 2009-10 -- pandemic strain, or swine flu -- we did see cases in the summer months.\"\n\nThat is not particularly good news, where many talk of the hot, humid Tokyo summer taking its toll on the virus.\n\nThe AP requested but was declined an interview with Dr. Richard Budgett, the IOC's medical and scientific director who was in Tokyo for the meetings.\n\nThe dynamic growth of the Olympics makes any schedule change difficult.\n\nAbout 73% of the IOC's $5.7 billion revenue in a four-year Olympic cycle comes from broadcasting rights from networks like NBC and NHK in Japan. Moving the Olympics back even two months would clash in North America with a full plate of sports broadcasts: NFL, NBA, baseball, and college football.\n\nThere is also the matter of millions of tickets sold, flights and hotels booked, and $3 billion in local sponsorship sold in Japan with advertisers expecting some results for their expenditure.\n\nA reporter for the Chinese news agency Xinhua asked if Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba -- a major Olympic sponsor -- would be free to come to the Olympics despite the fact he is from one of the two provinces has been the most severely affected by the virus.\n\n\"Depends where he'll be holidaying before he comes here,\" Coates said, cracking one of the few jokes of the night. \"Whoever it is has to comply with the rules of the Japanese (immigration) authorities.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshir\u014d_Mori",
