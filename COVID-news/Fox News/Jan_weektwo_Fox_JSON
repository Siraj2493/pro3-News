Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), announced the implementation of \"enhanced health screenings\" for airline passengers arriving from or traveling through the Wuhan province of China amid a mysterious viral outbreak in the region.\n\nScreenings will begin Jan. 17 at three major air hubs: San Francisco International Airport (SFO), John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York (JFK) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).\n\nCHINA CONFIRMS SECOND DEATH IN MYSTERY VIRAL OUTBREAK\n\nChinese health officials have already confirmed more than 40 cases of pneumonia -- as well as two deaths -- tied to the coronavirus, which has been linked to a seafood market in the city of Wuhan. Officials believe the virus spreads from animals to people, but have yet to rule out the possibility that it spreads from person to person, The Associated Press reported.\n\nHealth officials in Thailand and Japan have also confirmed cases of the virus, the latter of which was contracted in China and observed once the patient was hospitalized in Japan.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"To further protect the health of the American public during the emergence of this novel coronavirus, CDC is beginning entry screening at three ports of entry. Investigations into this novel coronavirus are ongoing and we are monitoring and responding to this evolving situation,\" Martin Cetron, M.D., director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said in a news release.\n\nThe CDC confirmed the deployment of 100 staffers to help the airports in their screening processes and bolster the existing staff at each air hub's quarantine areas.\n\nAt least six other countries across Asia have begun similar efforts to stem the spread of the virus, The Associated Press reported. Travelers are also being warned to take precautions when visiting China ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations later this month.\n\nOfficials have been quick to shut down rumors of a SARS reemergence, going so far as to punish several people who spread such information online.\n\nThe CDC and CBP expect around 5,000 travelers to be screened within the next few weeks at all three airports combined. The first direct flight from Wuhan arrives Saturday, at SFO, The AP said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_bartiromo@foxnews.com", "name": "Michael Bartiromo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The other patient who died, a 61-year-old man, had abdominal tumors and liver disease before contracting the virus.\n\nRecently, officials said it may be possible that the virus can be transmitted between humans, after a woman whose husband had worked at the Seafood Wholesale Market and fell ill, also contracted the virus despite not visiting the market. However, they also did not rule out that she may have contracted the coronavirus from eating food that the man brought home from the market.\n\nPOSSIBLE MYSTERY VIRUS IN CHINA COULD SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nJapanese health officials also reported the country's first case of the virus in a Chinese man who had recently returned from China, and had not visited the market but had \"close contact\" with someone who had been exhibiting pneumonia symptoms.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe man developed a cough on Jan. 3, while still in Wuhan, but was not hospitalized until he returned to Japan on Jan. 6, when he tested positive for the virus.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com\n\nHealth officials in China racing to determine the source of a viral illness that's sickened at least 41 people and resulted in one death have now said it's possible that it may be transmissible between humans. Most patients diagnosed with the illness, which has been identified as a coronavirus, had visited or worked at Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China.\n\nBut now, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said that one of the patients did not visit the market, and may have contracted the virus from her husband, who had worked there before he himself fell ill. Hong Kong health official Chuang Shuk-kwan said that it's also possible that the man brought food home from the market that infected his wife.\n\nDespite the development, officials pointed out that risk of human-to-human transmission remains low, as the dozens of doctors who have examined patients and the hundreds of others who have come into contact with them have not fallen ill. The World Health Organization (WHO) also said in a Jan. 12 news release that there is \"no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.\"\n\nMYSTERIOUS VIRAL PNEUMONIA OUTBREAK IN CHINA CLAIMS FIRST VICTIM\n\nWHO also said no additional cases have been detected since Jan. 3, and that seven patients had been released from the hospital. Sickened patients were mostly reporting fever, with few cases involving trouble breathing and invasive pneumonic infiltrates in both lungs. At this time, the health organization does not recommend any specific health measures for travelers.\n\nThe U.S. State Department, however, did warn Americans traveling to Wuhan about the virus, and referred to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to avoid contact with animals, animal markets, or animal products. It also urged citizens who had traveled to Wuhan and were feeling sick to seek medical care.\n\nTHIS YEAR'S FLU SHOT DOESN'T MATCH VIRUS CIRCULATING: REPORT\n\nThe rash of illnesses have stoked fears of SARS, another coronavirus that in 2003 infected an estimated 8,000 people and killed at least 770 after it spread to cities throughout China and other countries. However, health officials determined that laboratory tests ruled out the possibility of both SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as influenza, bird flu, adenovirus and other common respiratory illnesses.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChinese officials also said several people who had suggested a link to SARS on social media as a means to invoke fear would be punished for spreading false information.\n\nThe Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors":
