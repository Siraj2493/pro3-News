Tom Cotton stands by startling theory on coronavirus origins: 'We need to be open to all possibilities'", "body": "Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton responds to accusation of pushing a conspiracy theory linking Chinese government to coronavirus outbreak.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. stood by his earlier suggestion that the deadly coronavirus may have originated in a high-security biochemical lab in Wuhan, China, telling \"The Story\" Tuesday that we \"need to be open to all possibilities\" in exploring the origins of the outbreak that has sickened more than 75,000 people around the world.\n\nWhen host Martha MacCallum pressed the Senator on his startling and unverified claim, Cotton cited a study published by Chinese scientists in The Lancet, which he called a \"respected international science journal.\"\n\n\"I'm suggesting we need to be open to all possibilities and we need to demand that China open up and be transparent so a team of international experts can figure out exactly where this virus originated,\" Cotton said.\n\nCHINA STILL LYING ABOUT CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: TOM COTTON\n\nHe also brought up the \"questions\" surrounding the biosafety level 4 \"super laboratory\" in Wuhan, the city where the virus is believed to have originated.\n\n\"We know it didn't originate in the Wuhan food market based on the study of Chinese scientists ... I'm not saying where it started, I don't know. We don't know because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) won't open up to international experts,\" Cotton said. \"That's what we need to do so they can get to the bottom of where the virus originated and hopefully can effect a diagnostic test and vaccine for it.\"\n\nCotton also pushed back against critics, specifically Rutgers University chemical biology professor Richard Ebright, who said he found no indication in the genome sequence of the virus to indicate it was engineered.\n\n\"Let's take the professor,\" Cotton said. \"He was ...in fact today cited in the Asia Times saying that it was quite possible that it was a laboratory incident.\"\n\n\"That's not saying this is a bioweapon,\" Cotton clarified, \"but we do know they were investigating and researching coronavirus in that laboratory. It could've been an accidental breach, it could've been a worker that was infected.\"\n\n\"Until we get all the evidence from the Chinese Communist party, it is only responsible, not irresponsible to keep an open mind about the hypotheses.\"\n\n-- Sen. Tom Cotton, 'The Story'\n\n\"My point is that we don't know,\" Cotton said, adding that \"until we get all the evidence from the Chinese Communist Party, it is only responsible, not irresponsible, to keep an open mind about the hypotheses.\"\n\nCotton also mentioned reports earlier Tuesday that the State Department has designated five Chinese media outlets as \"foreign missions,\" calling them, in essence, state-sponsored propaganda agents of the CCP.\n\nMacCallum told Cotton that the State Department's designation \"does go to the point that you are making that the information we are getting is very difficult to verify,\" but Cotton turned his focus to The Washington Post and The New York Times, which have both published articles criticizing Cotton since his initial remarks and claimed he suggested the virus was the result of a Chinese bioweapon.\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT DESIGNATES 5 CHINESE MEDIA OUTLETS 'FOREIGN MISSIONS'\n\n\"It tells you the Chinese Communist Party, just like any communist party, has a widespread propaganda effort and regrettably The Washington Post and New York Times have taken millions and millions of dollars from something called 'China Daily' to run so-called inserts that purport to be news but in reality are Chinese propaganda,\" Cotton claimed.\n\nChina Daily Distribution Corporation is among the five media outlets designated foreign missions.\n\n\"They ought not be doing that,\" Cotton added.\n\nSEN. TOM COTTON: ELIMINATING CORONAVIRUS REQUIRES CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY TO MAKE BIG CHANGES\n\nThe senator said he \"hoped\" such contracts would be terminated and revealed that he had personally raised the matter in a letter to the Justice Department and Attorney General William Barr.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I wrote to the Department of Justice and Attorney General Bill Barr a few weeks ago asking them to examine these inserts and whether or not they ought to be registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act,\" he said.\n\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yael_halon@foxnews.com", "name": "Yael Halon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cotton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biochemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Ebright", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

McLellan, associate professor of molecular biosciences at UT Austin, talks about his team's recent breakthrough in studying the coronavirus, and how much closer we are to finding a cure.\n\nResearchers at the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the University of Texas at Austin claimed to have made a breakthrough in their coronavirus research on Wednesday and said their data could help develop a vaccine.\n\nScientists were able to create a 3D atomic-scale map of the part of the virus that attaches itself to human cells and causes infection, according to UT News. Mapping what researchers call the \"spike protein\" is a vital step toward developing vaccines and antiviral drugs.\n\nJason McLellan, an associate professor at UT Austin, spoke with Fox News on Thursday about the virus and said researchers hope to study the 3D map, in an effort to develop antibodies that can help fight the disease.\n\n\"What we've been able to do is produce the molecule that's on the surface of the coronavirus in our lab. So the surface of the virus contains these spike molecules that sort of resemble mushrooms and they use these molecules to bind to our cells and then cause the virus to enter the cells,\" he said.\n\n\"So we really want to target these spikes to prevent their function and prevent the virus from getting into our cell,\" McLellan continued. \"We were able to produce large quantities of these spikes in our lab and then using cryo-electron microscopy, determined a three-dimensional map of these spike molecules. With that information, we and others around the world will begin to apply rational engineering approaches to create small molecules, antibodies in vaccines that target the spike and hopefully prevent the function of this molecule\"\n\nHOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS?\n\nHe echoed the NIH's hope to have a vaccine developed within 18 months but said it could end up taking over two years to crack the code.\n\n\"Optimistically a vaccine could be created in 18 to 24 months,\" McLellan said. \"But this would still be extremely rapid compared to the one to two decades it normally takes, to make most vaccines. It's possible that the small molecules might be able to move quicker. There are some small molecules that have efficacy against other coronaviruses that may also work against this new coronavirus.\n\n\"So it's really a multi-pronged approach,\" he explained. \"Vaccines could be ideal because you can treat [people]. You can vaccinate everybody before they're infected and then hopefully provide immunity to the virus. One of the advantages we have is that we've been working on coronaviruses in general for the last five to six years.\"\n\nMcLellan also called for increased government funding to prep for possible outbreaks in the future, so that researchers are not caught flat-footed when the next threat appears.\n\n\"That's where we need government funding to fund basic science ... on these viruses before they emerge,\" he added. \"It's much better to have things ready than to try and rapidly respond to them.\n\n\"Something my lab is very interested in is developing a universal coronavirus, vaccines and countermeasures that would work against all coronaviruses, including those that have yet to emerge. And that way we can already have vaccines in stock ready to go before the next coronavirus outbreak occurs.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a press conference last week that vaccines are not the only tool that can be brought to bear against the outbreak and described it as just one piece of the puzzle.\n\n\"The development of vaccines and therapeutics is one important part of the research agenda. But it's not only one part,\" he explained. \"They will take time to develop -- but in the meantime, we are not defenseless. The first vaccine could be ready in 18 months, so we have to do everything today using the available weapons to fight this virus.\"\n\nAccording to Thursday estimates, more than 75,000 people worldwide have been infected with the novel coronavirus, now known as COVIS-19, while some 2,130 people have died.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"},

spurring authorities to take new steps in an effort to fight a soaring viral outbreak now blamed for at least eight deaths in Iran.\n\nItalian authorities announced they were shutting down carnival events in Venice as at least 133 people have been reported to have been infected with COVID-19 in the country. Nearly all of Italy's cases are clustered in the north, including in the northeast Veneto region, which includes Venice.\n\nThe dozens of newly confirmed cases have caused all schools and universities to be closed not only in Milan, but in the entire region of Lombardy, for an indefinite period of time as movie theaters, concerts and public gatherings have also been banned.\n\nTRUMP FURIOUS AMERICANS INFECTED WITH CORONAVIRUS FLEW BACK TO US WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION: REPORT\n\nItaly's first cases -- that of a married Chinese couple who were on vacation in Rome -- surfaced in early February. To date, two deaths have been reported in the country while 27 are reported to be in intensive care as of Sunday, officials told Fox News.\n\nItalian health officials have said they have not found the \"ground zero\" patient who may be behind the outbreak in the northern part of the country. A man who had traveled to China and was thought to have sickened another 38-year-old man in the northern part of the country has tested negative, health officials said.\n\nAmong the \"extraordinary measures\" announced by Italian officials include effectively quarantining about a dozen towns in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, where some 50,000 people live, according to the BBC.\n\n\"The contagiousness of this virus is very strong and pretty virulent,\" Lombardy's health chief Giulio Gallera said Sunday.\n\nBishops in several dioceses in northern Italy issued directives Sunday that holy water fonts be kept empty, that communion wafers be placed in the hands of the faithful and not directly into their mouths by priests celebrating Mass and that congregants refrain from shaking hands or exchanging kisses during the symbolic Sign of the Peace ritual, according to the Associated Press.\n\nArchbishop Rino Fisichella, a Vatican official whose siblings live in one of the hardest-hit towns, Codogno, declined to dramatize the measures.\n\n\"It's obvious that we need to use all necessary prudence\" to avoid spreading the virus among the faithful, he said.\n\nSACRAMENTO CONFIRMS FIRST CORONAVIRUS CASE IN PATIENT WHO TRAVELED TO CHINA\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said Sunday that he was putting his country on its highest alert for infectious diseases and ordered officials to take \"unprecedented, powerful\" steps to fight the soaring viral outbreak that has infected more than 600 people in the country in the past few days.\n\nMoon said his government had decided to increase its anti-virus alert level by one notch to \"Red,\" the highest level that allows authorities to order the temporary closure of schools and reduce the operation of public transportation and flights to and from South Korea.\n\nThe South Korean leader said that the outbreak \"has reached a crucial watershed,\" and that the next few days will be \"critical.\"\n\nSouth Korea announced 169 more cases of the new virus, bringing the country's total to 602. The country also reported three more fatalities, raising its death toll to six.\n\nWhile the number of patients worldwide is increasing, some virus clusters have shown no link to China and experts are struggling to trace where those clusters started. The World Health Organization said Saturday that at least 18 confirmed cases have been reported in Iran.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIran's health ministry said Sunday that at least eight people have died in that country's outbreak, which was first reported on Wednesday and centered mostly on the city of Qom.\n\nWhile WHO has not yet said where the Iran cases may have originated, the country's health minister, Saeed Namaki, told state TV that officials were nearly certain the virus came from China to Qom in central Iran. Among those who've died from the virus was a merchant who regularly shuttled between the two countries using indirect flights in recent weeks, after Iran stopped direct passenger flights to China, according to Namaki.\n\nHe did not say when the merchant had returned from China to Iran nor what steps health officials had taken to quarantine and check on those he'd come into contact with.\n\nHealth officials said they would help make face-masks and sanitizers available for Iranians, amid concerns that inventory was running low in the capital's pharmacies.\n\nIranians also went to the polls on Friday for nationwide parliamentary elections, with many voters wearing masks and stocking up on hand sanitizer. Iran's interior ministry on Sunday said voter turnout in last week's parliamentary elections stood at 42.57 percent, the lowest ever since the country's 1979 revolution that ushered in a Shiite clerical government to power.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed that Iran's enemies tried to discourage people from voting by exaggerating the threat of the virus, according to Reuters.\n\n\"This negative propaganda about the virus began a couple of months ago and grew larger ahead of the election,\" said Khamenei, according to his official website Khamenei.ir. \"Their media did not miss the tiniest opportunity for dissuading Iranian voters and resorting to the excuse of disease and the virus.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"},

He also received a steroid to treat inflamed lungs and \"serious shortness of breath\" and a lack of oxygen in his blood.\n\nHe reported traveling to Wuhan, China, where the COVID-19 outbreak began, from Jan. 8-12 and experienced initial symptoms of mild chills and a dry cough on Jan. 14, the first day of the illness.\n\nHis fever decreased as a result of the treatment, but his breathing worsened and his blood-oxygen levels plummeted as he reached his final day of life.\n\nHis heart stopped after experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs when fluid builds in the alveoli, the tiny elastic air sacs in the lungs that bring oxygen into the blood and expel carbon dioxide.\n\nCORONAVIRUS CONCERNS PROMPT RUSSIA TO BAR CHINESE CITIZENS ON TEMPORARY BASIS\n\n\"The pathological features of COVID-19 greatly resemble those seen in SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. In addition, the liver biopsy specimens of the patient with COVID-19 showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity (figure 2C), indicating the injury could have been caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury,\" the new report published in The Lancet concluded.\n\nThe new case study provides insight into how the virus attacks the lungs of patients. Such analysis has been limited by \"barely accessible autopsy or biopsy\" data, the study's authors said.\n\nGROUP OF MIRAMAR CORONAVIRUS EVACUEES RELEASED FROM QUARANTINE\n\nThe new coronavirus, COVID-19, has infected more than 72,000 people and killed over 1,868, far larger numbers than those who suffered from the SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, or MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, two other coronavirus epidemics of the past two decades.\n\nIn late 2002, a coronavirus nicknamed SARS broke out in Southern China, causing severe pneumonia and rapidly spreading to other countries. SARS infected more than 8,000 and killed 774, before disappearing altogether after a number of public health measures. In 2012, a similar outbreak known as MERS began infecting people in Saudi Arabia. It still causes infections in a small number of people each year, and in total has caused around 2,500 infections and more than 850 deaths.\n\nSARS and MERS came from animals, and this newest virus almost certainly did, too. The first people infected with the coronavirus visited or worked at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe SARS disease appeared to be more deadly,

And why not, when a premodern authoritarian society leaps wildly into the brave new world of high-tech science in a single generation?\n\nThe Chinese technological revolution is overseen by an Orwellian dictatorship. Predictably, the Chinese Communist Party has not developed the social, political or cultural infrastructure to ensure that its sophisticated industrial and biological research does not go rogue and become destructive to itself and to the billions of people who are on the importing end of Chinese products and protocols.\n\nBLOOMBERG NEWS EX-REPORTER'S WIFE SAYS HIS LAWYERS THREATENED TO 'RUIN' FAMILY OVER CHINA REPORTING\n\nCentral party officials run the government, military, media and universities collectively in a manner reminiscent of the science-fiction Borg organism of \"Star Trek,\" which was a horde of robot-like entities all under the control of a central mind.\n\nThirty years ago, American pundits began gushing over China's sudden leap from horse-drawn power to solar, wind and nuclear energy. The Chinese communist government wowed Westerners. It created from nothing high-speed rail, solar farms, shiny new airports and gleaming new high-density apartment buildings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWestern-trained Chinese scientists soon were conducting sophisticated medical and scientific research. And they often did so rapidly, without the prying regulators, nosy elected officials and bothersome citizen lawsuits that often burden American and European scientists.\n\nTo make China instantly rich and modern, the communist hierarchy -- the same government that once caused the deaths of some 60 million innocents under Mao Zedong -- ignored property rights. It crushed individual freedom. It embraced secrecy and bulldozed over any who stood in its way.\n\nIn much the same manner that silly American pundits once praised Benito Mussolini's fascist efforts to modernize Depression-era Italy, many naifs in the West praised China only because they wished that their own countries could recalibrate so quickly and efficiently -- especially in service to green agendas.\n\nBut the world is learning that China does not just move mountains for new dams or bulldoze ancient neighborhoods that stand in the path of high-speed rail. It also hid the outbreak and the mysterious origins of the deadly coronavirus from its own people and the rest of the planet as well -- a more dangerous replay of its earlier effort to mask the spread of the SARS virus. The result was that thousands of unknowing carriers spread the viral plague while the government covered up its epidemic proportions.\n\nChina, of course, does not wish to have either its products or citizens quarantined from other countries. But the Chinese government will not allow foreign scientists to enter its country to collaborate on containing the coronavirus and developing a vaccine.\n\nNo wonder internet conspiracies speculate that the virus was either a rogue product of the Chinese military's bioengineering weapons lab or originated from bats, snakes or pangolins and the open-air markets where they are sold as food.\n\nIt is hard to believe that in 2020, the world's largest and second-wealthiest county, which boasts of high-tech consumer products and gleaming cities, has imprisoned in \"re-education camps\" more than 1 million Uighur Muslims in the manner that Hitler, Stalin and Mao once relocated \"undesirable\" populations.\n\nChina seems confident that it will soon rule the world, given its huge population, massive trade surpluses, vast cash reserves and industries that produce so many of the world's electronic devices, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods.\n\nFor a year, the Chinese government has battled massive street demonstrations for democracy in Hong Kong. Beijing cynically assumes that Western nations don't care. They are expected to drop their characteristic human rights advocacy because of how profitable their investments inside China have proven.\n\nBeijing was right. Few Western companies complain that Chinese society is surveilled, regulated and controlled in a nightmarish fashion that George Orwell once predicted in his dystopian novel \"1984.\"\n\nAll of these recent scandals should remind the world that China got rich by warping trade and stealing technology in much the same way that it deals with epidemics and dissidents. That is, by simply ignoring legitimate criticism and crushing anyone in its way.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf the Chinese communist Borg is willing to put millions of its own citizens at risk of infection and death, why would it care about foreigners' complaints that China is getting rich and powerful by breaking international trade rules?\n\nThe truth about President Trump's decision to call China to account over its systematic abuse of international trade norms is not that Trump's policy is reckless or ill-considered.

And most tragically, an opioid epidemic kills tens of thousands of Americans every year,\" Carlson said on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" \"One of the chief reasons for that is a synthetic opioid called fentanyl, which is smuggled in from abroad.\"\n\nDOCTOR WHO SOUNDED ALARM ON CORONAVIRUS DIES, HOSPITAL SAYS\n\n\"A single theme ties them together: A systematic decision, by many of our country's most powerful leaders, to sell out this country to China,\" Carlson added.\n\nThe host warned that China \"is no longer simply an economic rival to the United States. It's becoming a dangerous enemy.\n\n\"But instead of protecting us from this threat ... our leadership class collaborates with the other side. Why? Simple: they're getting rich from it.\"\n\nThe host began his list of example's with last year's controversy involving the NBA, which began when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted a message of support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Many league officials and prominent players sought to distance themselves from Morey in order to pacify Beijing.\n\nCarlson then criticized lawmakers and former lawmakers for aligning themselves with China for a payday before moving on to America's universities.\n\n\"The entire sleazy academic world is addicted to Chinese money. Harvard and Yale both stand accused of hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in donations and payments from foreign countries,\" Carlson said. \"American academics have made it clear whose side they're on.\"\n\nFinally, Carlson singled out Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg and his past comments praising the communist regime.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"As China's power has grown, so has America's dependence on its chief rival,\" Carlson said. \"Outsourcing our manufacturing power brought American companies short-term profits, but in the long run, it has made us dangerously dependent on a nation that seeks to displace us on the world stage.\"\n\n\"The saddest and most infuriating part is that none of this needed to happen. China didn't just one day magically overtake us. Our leaders made it possible,\" Carlson added. \"They betrayed us.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victor_garcia@foxnews.com", "name": "Victor Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opioid epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourced_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outsourced (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Television show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALARM", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ALARM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why?_(American_band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Why?

Five other people were confirmed to have shown symptoms of the virus.\n\nNone of the 16 evacuees has had confirmed tests by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so federal authorities have yet to report them. They have been staying at Travis Air Force Base in California.\n\nFour were taken to a hospital in Washington state, while Scott Pauley, a CDC spokesman, wouldn't elaborate on where the others were taken.\n\nTENNESSEE DOCTOR, WIFE SEE CORONAVIRUS TURN THEIR CRUISE VACATION INTO A NIGHTMARE AS WIFE TESTS POSITIVE\n\nThe newly infected reportedly don't include the 14 people who officials had previously said tested positive before boarding two State Department chartered flights carrying 300 Americans from the Diamond Princess last Monday. Thirteen of them were brought to a hospital in Omaha, Neb., and the CDC says 11 are officially declared to have the virus.\n\nAnother doctor in Wuhan was also confirmed to have been killed by the virus Friday, adding to the list of leading medical professionals now deceased in the virus's epicenter.\n\nPeng Yinhua, a 29-year-old respiratory doctor died Thursday. Others killed by the virus include Wuchang Hospital director Liu Zhiming and Li Wenliang, who warned authorities about the virus before it was public.\n\nChina has suffered the most from the virus, which is now known as COVID-19, with the country having 99 percent of the cases. The U.S. has 26 patients, including 11 confirmed so far at a Nebraska hospital, eight in California, one in Texas, one in Wisconsin, one in Arizona, one in Washington state, one in Massachusetts and two in Illinois. Those numbers don't include the 11 recently shown to have the new virus.\n\nCDC officials added there will \"likely be additional cases in the coming days and weeks, including among other people recently returned from Wuhan.\"\n\nUT AUSTIN ANNOUNCES CORONAVIRUS 'BREAKTHROUGH' COULD HELP YIELD VACCINE\n\nThe U.S. had announced that Americans who traveled to China within the last 14 days would be sent to designated airports for enhanced screenings. Foreign nationals who recently went to China would be denied entry in the U.S., except for the immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry had said the U.S. hasn't given the country any substantive help in its fight against the coronavirus outbreak. They added the U.S. was contributing to the international panic surrounding the illness, Reuters reported.\n\nISRAEL: PEOPLE WHO VIOLATE COROANVIRUS SELF-QUARANTINES COULD FACE YEARS IN PRISON\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global emergency as it spreads to countries outside of China and the number of infected patients continues to grow.\n\nCountries around the globe have increased travel restrictions to the infected mainland China and Hubei province -- with the U.S. State Department increasing its advisory to level 4: \"Do Not Travel.\"\n\nThe CDC has issued an advisory to avoid all nonessential travel to the country.\n\nCoronavirus has now killed about three times the amount of people in China than were sickened during the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. The SARS outbreak killed 349 people in mainland China in 2002-2003 -- with 744 deaths and 8,096 infections globally, according to the CDC.\n\nThe virus has claimed the lives of 2,236 people and infected 75,465 around the globe. Only 11 people have died outside mainland China.\n\nSouth Korea recorded its first fatality from the virus on Thursday.\n\nFrance announced its first death on Saturday in a Chinese tourist who died in the country. It was the first fatality outside of Asia.\n\nJapan announced two people in their 80s who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship had died on Thursday. A week earlier, an 80-year-old woman died after being hospitalized near Toyko since Feb. 1.\n\nThe other deaths were in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines.\n\nThe WHO said the number of cases will keep growing as tests are pending on thousands of suspected cases.\n\nWhere is the virus?\n\nRoughly 99 percent of new cases have appeared in China with the vast majority of the cases in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan -- the epicenter of the virus.\n\nThe United Kingdom has nine cases in the country.\n\nSOUTH KOREA REPORTS FIRST CORONAVIRUS DEATH: HEALTH OFFICIALS\n\nJapan -- 519 (607 passengers on Diamond Princess cruise ship outside Yokohama) (3 deaths)\n\nThe flu has estimated to have killed roughly 10,000 to 25,000 people with nearly 19 to 26 million infected in the U.S. between October 1, 2019, and January 25, 2020, according to the CDC. Coronavirus has impacted a far lesser number, although it's not yet clear how many have been infected or how widespread it is.\n\nThere have also been reports it can be spread without symptoms showing up. In respiratory illnesses, people with the most symptoms are the most contagious, the agency said. Children and those over 65 are the most likely to get sick from the flu, the CDC added.\n\nIS THE NOVEL CORONAVUS HERE TO STAY?\n\nUnlike the coronavirus, there's a seasonal vaccine for the flu. People over six months out are advised by the agency to get it during annual vaccination, with certain rare exceptions, such as severe allergies to the shot.\n\nNo vaccine has been developed for coronavirus as of yet, which makes it dangerous in that respect.\n\nHow did it start?\n\nIt's not entirely clear how it started, but Chinese scientists believe the virus may have originated in bats. The pangolin, a type of scaly anteater was reported to be a possible host, according to a Chinese University. A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that genome sequences from seven patients tested were identical to the bat coronavirus.\n\nHow does it transmit?\n\nIt's believed the normal coronavirus can be transmitted most commonly through respiratory droplets in the air, as well as close contact with an infected person or touching areas contaminated with the virus before washing. The digestive tract may also transmit the disease, according to scientists from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Science.\n\nHOW IS CORONAVIRUS TRANSMITTED?\n\nThey recently discovered \"virus genetic material\" in feces samples and rectal swabs from some patients, Chinese state media reported.\n\nWhat are the current travel restrictions?\n\nThe U.S. declared the coronavirus a public health emergency with Trump signing an order barring entry to foreign nationals who recently were in China, other than the immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.\n\nOfficials at the CDC have advised travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country. The U.S. State Department raised its China travel advisory to \"Level 4: Do Not Travel.\"\n\n\"Those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus,\" The advisory said.\n\nVietnam stopped all flights to and from China.\n\nJapan, Singapore, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia all have similar policies to the U.S. on restricting non-citizens.\n\nMongolia and Singapore have shut their borders.\n\nSingapore said it would ban travelers from China's Hubei province.\n\nPakistan says they're halting all flights to and from China\n\nThe United Kingdom and New Zealand advised their people against nonessential travel to China.\n\nRussia has signed an order to close the border between them and China. They also blocked tour groups from China.\n\nChina has cut off access to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, trapping more than 50 million people\n\nHong Kong quarantining visitors from mainland China\n\nJapan bars foreign nationals who had been to Hubei province.\n\nCarnival and Royal Caribbean denying boarding of people who travel to China within 14 days.\n\nItaly suspended all flights to China.\n\nLONDON CAN HOST 2020 OLYMPICS IF CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK PERSISTS, MAYORAL CANDIDATE SAYS\n\nSouth Korea urged an increase in its level of caution to \"restraint\" when traveling to China.\n\nHong Kong reduced half its flights and shut down rail service to mainland China.\n\nCathay Pacific Airways asks 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave.\n\nDelta suspended all service to China.\n\nUnited Airlines suspends all flights between China and the U.S.\n\nUnited's pilots, concerned for their safety, were able to drop trips to China without pay, a union memo said, according to Reuters.\n\nAmerican Airlines suspends all flights to China.\n\nThe Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents 15,000 pilots for American Airlines filed a lawsuit to halt service with the airline, citing \"serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus.\"\n\n\"I am directing all APA pilots to cease flight operations between the United States and China,\" said APA president Eric Ferguson. \"Until further notice, if you are scheduled, assigned, or reassigned a pairing into China, decline the assignment by calling your Chief Pilot or IOC Duty Pilot.

News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...\n\nTrump slams Dems, Oscars, Brad Pitt and 'Parasite' as rally blitz moves to Colorado\n\nPresident Trump continued his four-state trip out West on Thursday evening with a wild rally in Colorado Springs, Colo., as he openly mocked Democrats' intra-party squabbling at Wednesday's presidential primary debate in Las Vegas -- and took an unexpected shot at the movie \"Parasite,\" prompting a scathing response from its U.S.-based distributor.\n\nThe event resembled a casual conversation at points as Trump also assessed that \"Mini Mike\" Bloomberg \"didn't do well last night\" and declared Amy Klobuchar's presidential campaign dead because she dejectedly asked Pete Buttigieg at the debate if he was calling her \"dumb.\"\n\nTrump then slammed the Oscars at length, saying he couldn't believe a foreign film like \"Parasite\" won for best picture. \"The winner is from South Korea.' I thought it was best foreign film. Best foreign movie. No -- did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got up and gave a little wise guy statement.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee quickly tweeted as Trump spoke: \"Parasite is a foreign movie about how oblivious the ultra-rich are about the struggles of the working class, and it requires two hours of reading subtitles. Of course Trump hates it.\" The U.S. distribution company for \"Parasite,\" NEON, retorted with its own nod to the film's subtitles: \"Understandable, he can't read.\" Click here for more on our top story.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n- Trump says Roger Stone has 'very good chance of exoneration' after GOP operative is sentenced to 3 years in prison\n\n- Sol Wisenberg: Stone case revealed AG Barr and his people viewed as 'occupying force' by some inside DOJ\n\n- James Comey responds to Trump with Mariah Carey GIF: 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'\n\nRussia 2.0: Intel officials warn Russia wants to interfere in 2020 election to help Trump get reelected, reports say\n\nIntelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Russia wants to interfere in the 2020 election to help President Trump get reelected, according to multiple reports on Thursday.\n\nThe warning was first reported by The New York Times and The Washington Post with the use of anonymous sources. In a classified briefing held on Feb. 13, Shelby Pierson, the top election-security official under then- acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, told members of the House Intelligence Committee and other national security officials about Russia's preference for Trump and the suspicion that they would try to act on the president's behalf.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the 2016 election through social media campaigns and stealing and distributing emails from Democratic accounts. Russia, they have said, was trying to boost Trump's campaign and cause chaos in the U.S. elections. Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded after a lengthy investigation that Russian interference was \"sweeping and systematic,\" but he did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign.\"\n\nThe new warning would revive old suspicions (and some critics say Democratic conspiracy theories) of collusion between Trump and Russia. According to reports, the news infuriated Trump, who complained that Democrats would use the information against him, and he then berated Maguire. This week, the president announced he was replacing Maguire as acting DNI with Richard Grenell, the current ambassador to Germany.\n\nTennessee doctor, wife see coronavirus turn their cruise vacation into a nightmare as wife tests positive\n\nA Tennessee doctor remained Thursday aboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship that's seen more than 600 passengers and crew -- including his wife -- test positive for the coronavirus, according to multiple reports.\n\nDr. Arnold Hopland, a physician from Elizabethton, has been confined to his cabin for 23 hours a day, with only the clothes on his back, after the couple's belongings were carried away on buses Monday, when they thought they'd be evacuating along with most of the ship's other American passengers. But then his wife Jeanie tested positive and was transported to a Japanese hospital.\n\nRather than return to the U.S., Dr. Hopland stayed aboard the ship, which is docked near Tokyo. \"If my wife is staying here, I'm staying here,\" he told Nashville's WKRN-TV.

Schambach's tumor was classified as Grade III, meaning it's malignant and also fast-growing. The tumors most often strike in patients between 35 and 44 but can occur at any age. The cause remains unknown.\n\nAccording to Fox 2 Detroit, Schambach had traveled to Cleveland Clinic in October for surgery to remove as much of the tumor as they could before beginning chemotherapy and radiation. However, earlier this month she learned that her blood counts were not improving, which is when Marie Schambach stepped in to help.\n\nHer message was even recognized by the hospital's social media

professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, joins Bill Hemmer on 'Bill Hemmer Reports.'\n\nFrequent flyers may be especially nervous about getting sick during their travels amid flu seasons and the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.\n\nWhat's worse, a recent study from MIT estimates that only about 20 percent of people in airports have clean hands (meaning they were washed with soap and water for a minimum of 15 seconds within the hour). However, researchers also found that if about 60 percent of airport-goers had truly clean hands, it could help slow the spread of global disease by as much as 69 percent.\n\nThough you can't control your fellow passengers, you can take matters into your own hands by thoroughly disinfecting your airplane seat before your next flight. Here's how:\n\nCHINESE BARS DELIVERING HAPPY HOUR DRINKS AMID CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN\n\nUse a pack of antibacterial wipes with alcohol to wipe down everything in your personal area, including the tray table, arm rest, seatbelt handle, air vents and call buttons, Ohio State University infectious disease specialist Debra A. Goff, Pharm.D. told Reader's Digest. Hitting these \"high touch\" areas is a surefire way to fight germs, she said.\n\nIf you're feeling generous, consider passing out the wipes to your fellow seatmates, Goff suggests -- after all, the cleaner the area, the better for all passengers.\n\n\"Unlike sharing bacteria and viruses, this is something you want to share,\" she said.\n\nWary of the upholstered seats? Whether you're flying high in first-class or hunkering down in economy, antibacterial wipes won't help you here. Instead, avid travelers may want to invest in a reusable seat and tray table cover, SmarterTravel recommends.\n\nFurthermore, a 2018 study of aircraft cleanliness suggested that seats' headrests may be the germiest surfaces on the plane, with some testing positive for E. coli bacteria. All the more reason to get sit back and relax with your own cover, on your own terms.\n\nDon't get too comfortable too quickly: If you're a fan of spreading out and using the seatback pocket for your belongings or snacks, SmarterTravel suggests keeping your personal items a bit closer. Because seatback pockets are often touched by dozens of passengers, they can harbor \"one of the airplane's highest concentrations of germs,\" the site claims.\n\nAccording to new research from Emory University, the safest place to sit on an airplane, interns of avoiding germs, might just be the window seat.\n\nRespiratory illnesses, like coronavirus, generally spread via a person coming into contact with an infected persons' saliva or mucus. Droplets from a sneeze or cough can land on surfaces, such as tray tables or arm rests, and potentially infect a nearby passenger sharing the enclosed space.\n\nHowever, study participants who sat in window seats had less interaction with other passengers -- beyond those sitting within two rows of them -- thus limiting their chances of interacting with an infected person, the study leads said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs the disease is transmissible between humans, check out these other safety tips for keeping yourself and your loved ones as healthy as possible amid

"body": "Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...\n\nBloomberg pummeled in debate debut - with Warren leading the onslaught\n\nThe Democrats' showdown Wednesday night in Las Vegas repeatedly put former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in his primary rivals' crosshairs as the surging billionaire made his debate-stage debut. But the event quickly expanded into an all-out melee and was easily the most aggressive debate of the nomination season to date, as each of the 2020 presidential candidates took sharp and often personal shots at one another.\n\nThe fight started out white-hot when, in her first turn at the microphone, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asserted she would support whoever wins the nomination, but warned that Democrats \"take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\"\n\nShe said the field is running against somebody \"who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians -- and no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump, I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\"\n\nIn another explosive moment, attendees erupted in the hall when Warren called on Bloomberg to release women from nondisclosure agreements they have signed concerning their civil complaints that he harassed them in the workplace. After a disappointing fourth-place finish in New Hampshire, Warren was particularly combative as she tangled with multiple rivals in a bid to distinguish herself once more ahead of Saturday's Nevada caucuses.

He said he didn't expect the Senate to vote against having him testify.\n\nRice, citing security clearance procedures for her own book, said she couldn't imagine \"withholding my testimony, with or without a subpoena\" or going public with information if she thought it was of national importance. But Bolton insisted his testimony would not have mattered.\n\n\"People can argue about what I should have said and what I should have done,\" he said. \"I would bet you a dollar right here and now, my testimony would have made no difference to the ultimate outcome.\"\n\nHe added, \"I sleep at night because I have followed my conscience.\" Click here for more.\n\nCoronavirus claims lives of two Diamond Princess passengers from Japan, health officials say\n\nTwo passengers from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off Yokohama, Japan, have died of coronavirus, Japan's health ministry said Thursday.\n\nThe Japanese man and woman, both in their 80s, reportedly had existing chronic diseases.

"body": "China has been hobbled by the mysterious coronavirus that emerged in the central city of Wuhan; the ruling Chinese Communist Party is taking aggressive measures to regain control of the situation.\n\nLeading infectious disease experts in China predict that the coronavirus may peak this month. I pray that scientists and medical professionals will find a cure for this deadly virus soon. The coronavirus outbreak will have a lasting impact on China and the rest of the world long after the virus is contained.\n\nThe first impact is the deepening and widening of the \"decoupling\" effect. President Trump's trade war with China kick-started a \"decoupling\" of the two largest economies in the world. U.S. manufacturing companies have begun to move their factories and supply chains out of China during the trade war in order to avoid higher U.S. tariffs on imported goods from China. Now with so many Chinese factories and businesses on an extended break due to the spread of the coronavirus and a number of countries including the U.S. imposing travel restrictions to and from China, more industries and more countries are rethinking whether they also need to decouple from China.\n\nFor example, China is one of the major auto parts suppliers in the world. Automaker Hyundai had to shut its assembly plants in South Korea recently because it couldn't get the auto parts it needed from China, as suppliers in China remain closed. Other automakers are working on a plan B to secure auto parts they need to keep their own operations going. Businesses worldwide, from auto companies to hockey stick makers, have learned the downside of relying on one country to supply so many things they need. Not only is the decoupling of the U.S. and China's economies irreversible, but also the decoupling will likely expand to include other nations as well. Be ready to see more global supply chains shift out of China.\n\nFAST-FOOD COMPANIES IN CHINA IMPLEMENT 'CONTACTLESS' DELIVERY, PICKUP IN WAKE OF OUTBREAK\n\nThe decoupling will contribute to the second long term impact -- that China may be permanently stuck in the \"middle-income trap,\" an economic phenomenon in which a rapidly growing economy stagnates at the middle-income level and fails to transition into a high-income economy. The World Bank defines the \"middle-income\" economy as one where per capita income is between $1,000 to $12,000 per year at constant prices. By this definition, China has been a \"middle-income\" economy for more than two decades.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping, who is fixated on returning China to world power status, desperately wants to avoid being stuck in the \"middle-income\" trap. However, China's economic growth has slowed down from double digits growth to a single-digit growth since 2012, due to rising debt, an aging population and slowing the pace of further economic reform. President Trump's trade war hurt China's economy further last year. China reported an official economic growth rate of 6.1 percent in 2019, which was the slowest in the last three decades. China's leaders had hoped that spending from Chinese consumers might keep the economy going. However, Chinese consumer spending was already impaired last year by the skyrocketing pork prices caused by the African swine fever. Experts said that China might be running out of time to \"graduate\" from the middle to the upper-income level.\n\nTherefore, the coronavirus hit the Chinese economy at the worst time possible. With this outbreak, domestic and international travel has gone down significantly; retail shops and restaurants are struggling to stay open with little foot traffic; factories are either still shut down or only partially open and many businesses are still on extended break out of concern for infection which means millions of workers are unable to go back to work. Small to midsize businesses, which have been the growth engine of China's economy, are struggling and at least a third of them are running low on cash. Several dozen cities, including Wuhan, a major industrial and commercial center, are still locked down, more than 60 million residents are trapped and there is no end in sight when they can resume their normal way of life, including going back to work. If this situation continues, a number of businesses may shut down and unemployment could rise because people have no work to return to.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThere is no doubt that the Chinese government will try to stimulate the economy with the same tools it used before such as cutting interest rates, mandating state-owned banks extend loans to small businesses and offering individual tax and rent relief. These tools may prevent the Chinese economy from going into a recession, but will not be sufficient to prevent China from getting stuck in the middle-income trap permanently, because experts warned that the only way for China to avoid the middle-income trap is to implement market-based structure reform, something Chinese leader Xi has been resisting since he came to power in 2012.\n\nThe third long term impact is mass migration out of China. For decades, the majority of Chinese people have accepted limited rights and freedom in exchange for the prosperity and stability of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) promised to provide. Unlike the Hong Kong protests and the internment of Uyghurs, the coronavirus affected everyone in China in one way or another. Chinese people took the hardest hit, with a death toll surpassing 800 and more than 66,000 infected cases. The fear of the virus and the draconian measures the Chinese government took, such as quarantining 60 million people, have disrupted people's normal lives. Then Chinese people learned that all their misery could have been prevented had Chinese authorities listened to whistleblowers who warned about the virus in December 2019. One of the whistleblowers, Dr. Li Wenliang, passed away recently after being infected by the virus through a patient. Dr. Li's death unleashed Chinese people's pent up anger and frustration toward the Chinese government's cover-ups, lies and incompetence. They began to reject the Communist Party leaders' singular focus on maintaining control and stability at all costs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThere are calls in China for more protection for freedom of speech. But the Chinese government has made sure those who dare to speak up pay a dear price. Two Chinese citizen journalists disappeared recently after posting footage of heartbreaking scenes from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus. It is unlikely we will see millions of Chinese take to the streets like Hong Kongers. But many people are so disappointed and angry with the government that they will leave China after the outbreak is over and seek a new safe haven for themselves and their families. Therefore, expect to see mass migration and capital flight out of China.\n\nWe will learn more in the coming days of the real impact of the coronavirus on China and the rest of the world. One thing we have already learned is that when China sneezes, the rest of the world gets more than just the cold.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"},

thermal imaging to detect coronavirus infections; Gillian Turner reports from Washington.\n\nChinese health officials released a report which stated that among nearly 45,000 cases of the novel coronavirus, 80 percent were mild and the rate of new cases has been falling since early February, as the country noted 1,886 new virus cases and 98 more deaths Tuesday.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general for the World Health Organization, said the report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave WHO a \"clearer picture of the outbreak, how it's developing and where it's headed.\"\n\nThe new disease first emerged in late December in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has spread to more than two dozen other countries. Chinese officials have said over 70,000 people have been infected and 1,868 have died in mainland China.\n\nThe new study reported on 44,672 cases confirmed in China as of Feb. 11. The virus caused severe diseases such as pneumonia in 14 percent and critical illness in 5 percent. The death rate for those confirmed cases has been 2.3 percent -- 2.8 percent for males versus 1.7 percent for females.\n\nThe COVID-19 cases have included few children, and the risk of death has risen with age and among people with health problems. The rate of new cases apparently has been declining since Feb. 1, but that could change as people return to work and school after the Chinese holidays, the report warned.\n\nJapanese officials, meanwhile, confirmed 99 more people were infected by the new virus aboard the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 454. Health Ministry officials said they have now tested 1,723 people on the ship, which had about 3,700 passengers and crew aboard. Outside China, the ship had the largest number of cases of COVID-19.\n\nOn Sunday night and Monday, 328 American cruise ship passengers arrived in the U.S., including 14 who tested positive for the virus and were taken to hospitals in California and Nebraska. Others were being quarantined at military bases in California and Texas.\n\nA charter plane dropped off 170 passengers at Travis Air Force Base in the San Francisco Bay Area late Sunday, while another took about 145 passengers to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas early Monday.\n\nFour of the Americans who tested positive for the virus were transported to California hospitals. Ten others, along with three spouses, were flown to Omaha, Neb., to get care at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, officials said. All are expected to remain at the university hospital for at least 14 days.\n\nU.S. CRUISE PASSENGER UNDER CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE REFUSES TO EVACUATE SHIP IN JAPAN\n\nNew cases in other countries, meanwhile, raised concerns about containing the virus. Taiwan on Sunday reported its first death from the virus, the fifth death outside mainland China. Taiwan's Central News Agency, citing health minister Chen Shih-chung, said the man who died was in his 60s and had not traveled overseas recently and had no known contact with virus patients.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened a meeting of experts to discuss containment measures in his country, where more than a dozen cases have emerged in the past few days without any obvious link to China.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJapan had at least 518 confirmed cases, including the 454 from the cruise ship, and one death from the virus.", "source": {"uri":
