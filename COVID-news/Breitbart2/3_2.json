In my colleague Kyle Olson's must-read reporting on the event, you will discover the whole thing was a fiasco, like something out of a sitcom. Guests appeared and then disappeared. The sound was garbled. People were introduced, followed by an awkward pause when they didn't appear. Babies cried...\n\n\"Biden seemed to be reading from a teleprompter, but the broadcast suffered from severe tech issues, as Biden's words were caught in a feedback loop, muddying the whole presentation and making the candidate nearly indecipherable,\" Olson reported.\n\nAfter starting two hours late, the fiasco lasted about 45 minutes. For my money, this clip from The Honeymooners, where Ralph and Ed attempt to do a live television commercial, is the funniest thing ever captured on film. Sounds like Grandpa Joe just took that crown.\n\nTechnical difficulties, however, are technical difficulties. That doesn't mean those technical difficulties are not newsworthy. After all, we are talking about a major presidential campaign, about the competency, or lack thereof, of the people hand-picked by Biden to run his campaign. So it is a bit disconcerting that Joe and his staffers were unable to put on the equivalent of a video podcast, something millions of everyday Americans are able to do every day in their basements without a hitch.\n\nThe media tell us that any criticism of Grandpa Joe's mental acuity is a hoax, is fake news, is a desperate and desperately unfair personal attack...\n\nAnd then this happens:\n\n\"Even I can't do that for another two years -- another year, between now and November ... ... ... or actually, January ... .... .... .... .... .... But to be covered.\"\n\nFor the Biden-challenged, allow me to lay this out as simply as possible. The date of the livestream was March 13, 2020. The presidential election will take place in November of 2020. The next president will be sworn in in January of 2021...\n\n\"Even I can't do that for another two years.\" No. There are only ten months between now and the next inauguration.\n\n\"...another year, between now and November.\" No. There are only eight months between now and November.\n\n\"...or actually January.\" Why don't we warm you up some oatmeal and see who's guest-starring on Matlock with that nice Andy Griffith today?\n\nAnd then Joe shuffles off to watch Matlock while rambling on about estuaries and international species.\n\nAre Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) really going to do this? Do they really think they can hide this guy for the next eight months? Do they really think they can scream hoax every time his feeble mind and body appear feeble for the next eight months?\n\nWatch this... And this is not a video sent back to us from the future. This is not video sent to us from President Biden's last day in office in January of 2029 when he's 87-years-old. This video was taken Tuesday:\n\nEarly on, he's self consciously trying not to shuffle, he has that waxy look on his face, and then he almost falls over.\n\nAre Democrats really going to do this?\n\nAnd here's video of Grandpa Joe screaming that someone's \"full of shit\" about something called an \"AR-14.\"\n\nHonestly, outside of a nursing home when the power goes out during Wheel of Fortune, I've never seen anything like this...\n\nDon't you understand? There's a conspiracy afoot to get Joe to yell and shuffle and forget the year and meander and walk off camera...\n\nEven though Democrat presidential candidates like Cory Booker, Julian Castro, and Tim Ryan were the first to express concerns about Biden's mental acuity, it's all a Trumpian plot!", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_nolte@breitbart.com", "name": "John Nolte", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honeymooners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Honeymooners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teleprompter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hoax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Griffith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Griffith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matlock (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Estuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(American_game_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheel of Fortune (American game show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ryan_(Ohio_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Ryan (Ohio politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Castro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Castro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(criminal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy (criminal)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative Video", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online_Media", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online Media", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Video", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Video", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Biden-Iowa-Confused.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 13627, "pinterest": 6}, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 13633, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1481496738", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-12", "time": "23:41:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-12T23:41:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-12T21:45:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.8196078538894653, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/12/white-house-report-nancy-pelosi-pressed-to-include-taxpayer-funding-of-abortion-in-coronavirus-stimulus/", "title": "Report: Pelosi Proposed Taxpayer Funding of Abortion in Coronavirus Bill", "body": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attempted to ensure a Hyde Amendment loophole is included in a coronavirus economic stimulus proposal, reported the Daily Caller Thursday.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Caller, those officials alleged that while negotiating the stimulus with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Pelosi tried to lobby for \"several\" provisions that stalled bipartisan commitment to the effort. One was a mandate for up to $1 billion to reimburse laboratory claims, which White House officials say would set a precedent of health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment.\n\nOne White House official reportedly explained:\n\nA new mandatory funding stream that does not have Hyde protections would be unprecedented. Under the guise of protecting people, Speaker Pelosi is working to make sure taxpayer dollars are spent covering abortion -- which is not only backwards, but goes against historical norms.\n\nAnother White House official reportedly called the provision a \"slush fund,\" and a third asked \"what the Hyde Amendment and abortion have to do with protecting Americans from coronavirus?\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he would sign any coronavirus stimulus bill that Congress passed, but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced his opposition to Pelosi's proposal and urged a rewrite over the next day or two.\n\nPelosi, however, criticized McCarthy's plan, stating \"families have needs,\" and that a decision was needed \"to help families right now.\"\n\nIn July 2019, Democrat 2020 candidate Joe Biden, after reversing course on the Hyde Amendment several times, then revealed his health plan would enshrine Roe v. Wade into the Constitution and force taxpayers to fund abortion.\n\nThe Biden campaign said his health plan would build on the \"progress' of Obamacare's contraceptive mandate that offers \"free preventive care including contraception,\" by \"repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one's zip code or income.\"\n\nIn 2016, failed Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accepted the endorsement of abortion giant Planned Parenthood and called for an end to the Hyde Amendment. Clinton claimed the longstanding provision was \"making it harder for low-income women to exercise their full rights\" to abortion.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dr_susan_berry@breitbart.com", "name": "Dr. Susan Berry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Mnuchin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Mnuchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraceptive_mandate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contraceptive mandate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Naturally, it neglected to mention how the virus ran wild in the first place because of Chinese bureaucratic incompetence and cover-ups.\n\nThe Chinese have become as determined to wipe the first months of the coronavirus from the pages of history as they are to keep anyone from remembering Tiananmen Square. The Xinhua article made a point of noting that China has leverage over the U.S. and Europe because it can restrict the supply of medicines that were unwisely outsourced to China in the heyday of globalism.\n\nThe Chinese paper explicitly threatened to do so if Americans and Europeans continue criticizing its response to the coronavirus or act too slowly to lift travel bans and other restrictions the Chinese government dislikes, but then cushioned the threat in the Communist Party's usual creepy way by insisting China is filled with so much \"love\" for the world that it would never harm the people of other countries, or even \"insult\" them the way China has been \"insulted\" during the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nOne of the insults harped on by Xinhua was Walter Russell Mead's February 3 op-ed for the Wall Street Journal entitled \"China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia,\" a piece that prompted Beijing to expel Wall Street Journal reporters and begin complaining incessantly that Mead's piece was insulting and racist. According to Xinhua's March 4 editorial, Mead, his column, and the entire Wall Street Journal publication are now \"infamous.\"\n\nAlthough most commentary has focused on the \"mighty sea of coronavirus\" threat, the Xinhua piece is also interesting as an early example of the Chinese Communist propaganda crusade to portray the coronavirus as originating in the United States and claim it was brought to Wuhan by the U.S. Army. Xinhua muttered darkly on March 4 about Americans \"returning from Wuhan, China\" right before the outbreak exploded and complained it was therefore hypocritical and insulting for the U.S. to impose travel bans on China.\n\nThe article was noticed and partially translated by Fox News on Friday in light of the Food and Drug Administration's announcement that at least one unspecified drug useful for treating coronavirus patients is currently in short supply because the components for the drug cannot be obtained readily enough from China.\n\n\"In other words, they threatened to kill us, and we're all sort of standing back like, 'Oh, you know it's not a big deal.' It's a terrifying situation,\" Tucker Carlson of Fox News said on Wednesday.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) warned in a Fox News interview on Thursday that \"about 80 percent of the active ingredients\" in some vital drugs come from abroad, \"and the overwhelming majority of that 80 percent are manufactured in China.\"\n\nRubio and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich elaborated on China's leverage over the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, and other sectors of the American economy, in an op-ed for Fox:\n\nFor years, China has enticed American multinational corporations with access to its markets in exchange for off-shoring and sharing intellectual property. Americans watched as Beijing captured critical portions of global supply chains, including in pharmaceutical drugs and medical equipment. Today, up to 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in American drugs are sourced abroad.\n\nNow, in the face of a pandemic, the absence of domestic capacity in critical medical sectors has critically endangered both the U.S. public health system and our economy. The inability to quickly increase the production of key supplies, such as surgical masks, medical gowns, respirators and pharmaceutical drugs limits our ability to mitigate the worst effects of the disease in this emerging crisis and in any future pandemic.\n\nIt is unacceptable that China holds this much leverage over America's public health and economy, both essential components of our national security. For this reason, we propose that the U.S. take action to expand our production capacity while global supply chains are in flux and the global economy teeters on the edge of recession.\n\nRubio and Gingrich suggested encouraging and incentivizing American corporations to bring manufacturing capacity back from overseas, especially from hostile areas like China, taking advantage of the current chaos in global markets to implement measures that might have seemed unacceptably risky or painful in calmer times.\n\n\"America must make rebuilding our domestic supply chain a priority of its own,\" they wrote, comparing their recommendations to Beijing's deliberate strategy for capturing the biomedical industry.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"},

However, Washington Post fact-checker Meg Kelly explained the video clip is a \"blatant\" misrepresentation of the president's remark.\n\n\"At the 10-second mark [of the ad], the camera shows a tight shot of the president saying 'coronavirus' and then cuts to a wide shot where [Trump] says, 'this is their new hoax.'

Rather, Biden's ad clipped a large part of Trump's speech to make it seem as though he had,\" Kelly writes. \"Ultimately, the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak, the fact that Trump had clarified his comments on the matter before the ad was released, and the blatant way the Biden camp isolated his remarks about the American Dream pushed us to Four Pinocchios.\"\n\n\"Campaigns must be willing to make their case without resorting to video manipulation,\" she added.\n\nA Biden aide sidestepped the Post's refutation of the ad and instead resorted to an ad hominem attack against the president, calling him the \"most dishonest president in American history.\"\n\n\"We don't trust his next-day cleanup attempt, and he has made many comments in that same vein. And the claim that the American Dream was 'dead' in the final year of the Obama administration -- during the longest streak of job growth in American history -- is categorically untrue and another reminder of Donald Trump's deep cynicism,\" Rapid Response Director Andrew Bates said.\n\nThe Post's fact-check column regularly grades statements by lawmakers, which range from one to four Pinocchios -- with one counting as a minor offense to four being a certifiable falsehood.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden delivered a speech addressing the deadly outbreak in which he described the Trump administration's coronavirus response as a \"colossal\" failure.\n\n\"The administration's failure on testing is colossal. And it's a failure of planning, leadership and execution,\" the former vice president said. \"By next week, the number of tests should be in the millions, not the thousands.\"\n\nBiden said that the deadly illness revealed \"severe shortcomings\" of the Trump administration and accused the president of stoking fears nationwide.

About 341 of these Chinese nationals sought to enter the U.S. illegally just within the last few months.\n\nDHS data finds that Chinese nationals are continuing to arrive at the southern border, with about six being apprehended within the last couple of days. There are now close to 81,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China and 3,180 deaths.\n\n\"We have a unique public health threat posed by individuals arriving unlawfully at the border, where migrants, law enforcement officials, frontline personnel, and the American public are put at risk,\" a senior DHS official told Breitbart News.\n\n\"All it would take is a single infected individual to impact the detained migrant community within DHS facilities,\" the official said. \"Without proper precautions, which can only happen through orderly, lawful migration, the virus threatens to spread rapidly. Any halting of [Remain in Mexico] would exacerbate this threat.\"\n\nBrazil, where 151 cases of the coronavirus are confirmed, has had about 6,400 of their nationals arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border since October. Similarly, eight Iranian nationals, 12 Italian nationals, 346 Russian nationals, 160 Romanian nationals, 204 Vietnamese, 827 Indian nationals, and 1,045 nationals from Cameroon -- countries that have a combined coronavirus-infected population of nearly 30,000 and 1,781 deaths.\n\nTo the south of the U.S., Mexico now has 12 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and since October, nearly 110,000 Mexican nationals have inundated the southern border. Every confirmed coronavirus case in Mexico involves a person who recently traveled abroad or has been in close contact with a person who recently traveled abroad.\n\nLikewise, close to 21,000 Honduran nationals have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past five months as two cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the country.\n\nThe countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have yet to have any confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but their nationals have traveled through coronavirus-affected Mexico to make their way, illegally, to the U.S.\n\nSince October, about 44,370 nationals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have arrived at the southern border by first traveling through coronavirus-affected Mexico.\n\nA DHS official told Breitbart News that the volume of migrants, especially from countries with confirmed coronavirus infections, along with crowded federal detention facilities and the straining of public healthcare resources pose a risk in terms of trying to prevent more spread of the virus.\n\nDespite the risk, Trump said last week that his administration was not particularly reviewing any plans to close the nation's most porous border.\n\nAlready, Trump has implemented travel bans on China, Iran, and most of Europe at the direction of medical experts who say European countries helped spread the coronavirus to about 30 U.S. states.

across the country.\n\nDespite appearing completely deserted due to quarantine, the streets of Italian cities like Naples, Rome, Siena, Torino, Cagliari, Benevento, Lecce, and Salerno were nonetheless filled with song and life.\n\nLa Stampa assembled a compilation of the social media videos of Italians on lockdown serenading each other.\n\nIn the beautiful city of Siena -- located in the country's Tuscany region -- chants of \"long live Siena\" rang through the barren streets, as proud Italians quarantined in their homes sang their city's well-known folk song in unison from their windows.\n\nSiena, like the rest of Italy, remains in lockdown to stop the spread of the Chinese coronavirus throughout the nation.\n\nA video of the moment was posted to social media, where it went viral.\n\nWatch below:\n\n\"In Siena, the city to which I am very attached, you stay at home but you sing together as if you were on the street. I was moved,\" tweeted Italian journalist David Allegranti.\n\nThe song, entitled \"Canto della Verbena\" (Song of the Verbena) -- also known as \"E mentre Siena dorme\" (While Siena Sleeps) -- is sung to show local pride in Siena.\n\nBelow are the lyrics translated to English:\n\nVerbena is born in Piazza del Campo\n\nLong live our Siena, long live our Siena\n\nVerbena is born in Piazza del Campo\n\nLong live our Siena, the most beautiful city!\n\nSiena is not the only city to be filled with song while its streets remain empty, as similar heartwarming moments can be seen echoing across Italy in other cities and villages.\n\nOn Monday, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced that he was expanding travel restrictions to cover the entire country in an attempt to stop the Wuhan

Trump Not 'Psychologically Capable to Put the Country's Well-Being First'", "body": "Monday on MSNBC, former CIA Director John Brennan questioned the psychological capabilities of President Donald Trump \"to put the country's well-being first,\" in regards to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHost Andrea Mitchell said, \"You've dealt with post-9/11. You've dealt with crises throughout your career in intelligence, real homeland security issues, inside the White House, and in the agency. This feels so very different.\"\n\nBrennan replied, \"It is very different. And when I was the Homeland Security adviser for President Obama, three months into the administration, we had to deal with the H1N1 crisis. And this was a crisis that was obviously identified first inside the United States, not abroad, so we didn't have time to try to figure out how it should.\"\n\nMitchell asked, \"How bad? Refresh our viewers' memory about H1NI.\"\n\nBrennan said, \"It was identified first in April of '09 and then through the next year, too, because once it subsided over the summer, it came back in the fall and the winter. There were about 60 million Americans that were affected by H1N1 virus, with about 12,000 deaths. It was different than the coronavirus right now in terms of its transmissibility as well as which demographics were affected by the virus. H1N1 infected younger adults much more seriously than the older population. So one of the things President Obama told us, he wanted to have the science, facts, and data drive administration policies and actions.\"\n\nMitchell interjected, \"And later on, President Obama had to deal with Ebola. So he really had two on his watch.\"\n\nBrennan said, \"Right, and he had created then a pandemic office in the White House that has been taken down by the Trump administration. So, one of the things I think we see the difference here is that Donald Trump, who throughout his entire life, he's looked through the world through a prism of how things affect his financial and political fortunes. I wonder if he's psychologically capable to put the country's well-being first and to subordinate his own interests in trying to spin things in a manner that won't reflect badly on him.\"\n\nHe added, \"Politics need to be damned at this point. The health and safety of the American public is most important. Now, obviously, we want to make sure that our economy is going to be able to width stand the traumatic hit it seems to be taking right now, but we want to make sure there is truth and honesty coming out from our public officials.

I circled Trump's lead Secret Service agent, just because,\" the tweet read.\n\nAfter he was blistered for doing something so obviously reckless, Nakamura deleted the tweet, but here's a screenshot. Breitbart News has obscured the face of the agent so we don't contribute to identifying him.\n\nNakamura's first reason for revealing the identity of a Secret Service agent was, as you read above, a snarky \"just because.\"\n\nAfter he deleted the tweet, Nakamura tweeted out a second explanation.\n\n\"I see there are questions about why I circled him,\" he wrote. \"No reason other than just to identify someone people might not recognize and also I wrote this today about Service role in safeguarding Potus in face of virus risk.\"\n\nFor obvious reasons, this explanation was met with derision and accusations of racism: Har har, look at the Chinese Secret Service agent escorting the president to a meeting about -- wait for it, wait for it -- coronavirus!\n\nCuz the virus started in China and Trump has a Chinese guy protecting him and, yeah, that's funny and I'm Japanese and part of the Washington Post's anti-Trump #Resistance, so it's okay for me to joke like this, and let's not forget that anyone who protects Drumpf is a white supremacist, even if he's Chinese and stuff, so here's a good look at a white supremacist...\n\nWho knows what this moron was thinking.\n\nAnyway, after that explanation blew up in his left-wing face, Nakamura deleted that tweet and tried again.\n\n\"I deleted an earlier tweet about the Secret Service,\" he tweeted. \"I wrote today about the agency's role in dealing with the threat of coronavirus so I was interested in its tactics but should not have singled out its personnel. My apologies.\"\n\nWhy would any responsible person publicize the identity of Trump's lead Secret Service agent? The whole idea of the Secret Service is the secrecy required to protect the one man who represents the will, ideals, hopes, and future of the American people. That secrecy is part of what shields the president. The media, at least until now, have protected the identity of Secret Service agents, going so far as to try and crop them out of photos, when possible.\n\nNeed I even explain that if you are someone looking to harm the president, how helpful it is to know exactly who is protecting the president?\n\nIn one thoughtless, mean-spirited tweet, a Washington Post staffer not only gave a potential assassin an advantage, this so-called reporter put a target on the back of this agent.\n\nWhat we have here is one more piece of proof that the very same media that has a national tantrum every time Trump violates what the media considers a cherished norm, is the same media so filled with rage and hate, they're running around violating all the norms that actually matter.\n\nForget about all those norms outlets like the Post have violated in their ongoing campaign to try and to destroy Trump -- the reliance on unnamed sources the media know are lying, etc...\n\nLook at all the times the media have behaved in a way that put the president and his supporters in danger.\n\nJust don't call the media the enemy of the people, though.

Tom Cotton (R-AR) has launched a new television ad airing in Ohio ahead of next week's presidential primaries in the state, ripping former Vice President Joe Biden for his ties to and corruption with regard to the Chinese Communist government in Beijing.\n\nThe ad, provided exclusively by Cotton to Breitbart News ahead of its public release, is one of the most vicious hits on Biden and his family's corruption and deep ties to the Chinese Communist regime in Beijing. It also comes in the wake of a Cotton op-ed in the National Review where the senator goes after Biden on this:\n\n\"They run concentration camps,\" a narrator says of the Communist Party of China at the open of the ad as an on-screen image of Chinese dictator Xi Jinping appears with a quotation from a Washington Post editorial in February that noted China has \"corralled\" at least a million people into camps.\n\n\"They force the abortion of millions of babies,\" the narrator continues as the background image changes to an Asian woman with a quotation from a 2016 National Public Radio (NPR) article that notes China's \"One-Child Policy\" has led to government-forced abortions.\n\n\"They have brutally cracked down on protesters,\" the narrator says next, as images of the Hong Kong protesters the Communist regime in Beijing has targeted are shown on-screen.\n\n\"They hack America's networks,\" the narrator reads after that, as a headline from February from the Associated Press that noted the \"Chinese Military Stole Masses of Americans' Data\" flashes across the screen.\n\nWATCH: SEN. TOM COTTON'S NEW AD EXPOSING JOE BIDEN'S WEAKNESS ON CHINA:\n\n\"They have stolen millions of our jobs,\" the narrator says next, as a January headline from CNBC noting the Chinese trade deficit has cost Americans at least 3.7 million jobs is shown.\n\nNext, images of Chinese military officials marching are shown, as the narrator and on-screen text makes clear that \"China is the greatest threat to America's security and our values.\"\n\nThen images of Joe Biden walking with Xi Jinping are shown, as the narrator notes that \"career politician Joe Biden is weak on China.\"\n\nThen it shows Biden from earlier in his 2020 presidential campaign speaking on the campaign trail, downplaying the threat of the Chinese Communists to the United States. \"China is going to eat our lunch? Come on man,\" Biden said, dismissing the threat. \"They're not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They're not a competition for us.\"\n\nAs video of Biden shaking hands with Xi shifts on-screen to a photo of Joe and Hunter Biden wearing sunglasses with a Chinese Communist flag in the backdrop, the narrator starts slamming Hunter Biden and Joe Biden for corruption and weakness in the face of the regime in Beijing.\n\n\"When Joe Biden was vice president, his son got a sweetheart $1.5 billion deal from the Bank of China,\" the narrator says. \"When Joe Biden was a senator, he voted to give China special trade status that devastated American workers. Biden is weak on China and wrong for America.\"\n\nThe ad wraps with a positive note for President Donald Trump. \"We need to stand up to China and protect American jobs and our national security,\" the narrator says. \"Sen. Cotton is standing with President Trump to take on China and Keep America Great.\"\n\nA Cotton adviser told Breitbart News that this advertisement is airing in Ohio ahead of this coming Tuesday's Democrat primary, where Biden will face Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as the two duke it out for the Democrat nomination. Biden has strung together a series of huge wins since winning the South Carolina primary a week and a half ago. He followed his South Carolina win with a massive Super Tuesday, where he beat Sanders in a number of states he was not expected to win. Biden did it again this Tuesday night, winning places Sanders had said he intended to win like Michigan -- forcing Sanders, his last serious competitor for the Democrat nomination, back onto his heels with several key states around the corner.\n\nThe ad also comes as the coronavirus crisis sweeps the nation, sending markets into panic in recent days as public health officials attempt to stem what the World Health Organization (WHO) has now formally declared a worldwide pandemic. While some Democrats and establishment media outlets now falsely say it is racist or offensive to point out, the coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, and after the communist regime's mishandling of the disease ,it spread around the world, eventually reaching American shores.\n\nIn a statement provided to Breitbart News exclusively accompanying this new advertisement that Cotton is airing nationwide, digitally as well as on television in Ohio, specifically targeting areas hit by manufacturing job losses thanks to China's aggression, the senator made the case that Biden's deep and corrupt ties to the Communist regime in Beijing compromise the ability of the former vice president to handle a crisis like the coronavirus gripping the world right now.\n\n\"China is the greatest threat that we face,\" Cotton told Breitbart News. \"China's duplicity and incompetence handling the Wuhan coronavirus has caused a pandemic. But Joe Biden has been weak on China his whole career. Biden is so bad that we know he's not a Chinese agent -- if he were, his handlers would tell him to occasionally oppose China to appear credible. Anyone who is concerned about China's aggression or theft of American jobs needs to know that Joe Biden cannot be trusted to stand up to China.\"\n\nAs Breitbart News has previously reported, while Cotton is up for re-election this year in Arkansas facing no Democrat opponent, he is free to do more on the campaign trail nationally to challenge leftist Democrats like Biden -- and to help President Trump. This is the second such ad Cotton has released in as many weeks, with a previous post-Super Tuesday ad tying Sanders' socialism together with Biden's extreme open borders positions, noting there is not much daylight between them despite Biden's inaccurate claims of being a \"moderate.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Dissolved Pandemic Unit but Did Not 'Fire the Entire White House Pandemic Team'", "body": "CLAIM: President Donald Trump \"fired the entire White House pandemic team.\"\n\nVERDICT: Partly false. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton \"dissolved\" the pandemic office but staff remained to deal with the issue.\n\nLast month, Democrats tried a new way of blaming Trump for the coronavirus outbreak. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg claimed during the Democrat debate in South Carolina that Trump \"fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago, so there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. [Applause] And he's defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC so we don't have the organization we need.\"\n\nBreitbart News rated that \"Mostly False.\" We noted:\n\nIn reality, the pandemic expert -- Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer -- left the National Security Council (NSC) voluntarily after then-National Security Advisor John Bolton was appointed.\n\nBolton disbanded the unit that Ziemer was supervising as part of an effort to downsize the bloated NSC staff...\n\nThe Trump administration has indeed proposed cuts to the CDC, but they have not been passed by Congress.\n\nMoreover, some of the experts who had been part of the office remained on staff at the National Security Council.\n\nEarlier this week, Democrats asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the president's coronavirus team who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, about the decision to cut the White House's National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense. He was asked whether it had been a \"mistake.\"\n\nFauci said no, but added that it would also have been \"nice\" to have it around.\n\n\"I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very well with that office. It would be nice if the office was still there,\" he said.\n\nShe admitted she did not know \"whether the decision to disband the directorate, which was made in May 2018, after John Bolton became national security adviser, was a tactical move to downgrade the issue or whether it was part of the White House's interest in simplifying and shrinking the National Security Council staff.\"\n\nBut she argued the decision created \"unclear structure and strategy for coordinating pandemic preparedness and response.\"\n\nStill, she did not claim all the experts had been fired.\n\nAlso on Friday, a journalist at President Donald Trump's press conference on coronavirus in the Rose Garden at the White House asked the president about the decision to cut the office. Trump said he did not know about it -- which he may not have, since it was a decision made by Bolton.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) took to Twitter to accuse the president of lying, and added that Trump had \"fired the entire White House pandemic team.\"\n\nAfter his tweet was retweeted by a New York Times reporter, several former NSC officials began to push back.\n\nFormer senior NSC official Tim Morrison -- who testified in the impeachment hearings -- called Sen. Brown's claim \"total garbage\":\n\nFormer NCS official Richard Goldberg noted that the staff in question were still at the White House:\n\nUltimately, the argument is about whether the office should have been kept as a separate unit, or whether its functions could be done just as well by employees working in other parts of the organizational structure.\n\nFauci, who is a rare case of an expert whose opinion is valued by both sides, said it was not a \"mistake\" to cut the office but that it would be \"nice\" if it were still there. He may agree with the criticism -- but only up to a point.\n\nAt some point it is worth questioning whether now is the best time for Democrats to be looking for a way to blame the president, or a way to help him -- after wasting weeks on impeachment while he was tackling coronavirus.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.

Private Industry to Fight Coronavirus", "body": "President Donald Trump declared a State of Emergency in the United States on Friday, but he also demonstrated to Americans that both the government and private industry are engaged to help fight the coronavirus.\n\nThe president detailed what Vice President Mike Pence has described this week as a \"whole of America approach\" to fighting the virus, using the best of public and private resources to reduce its spread in the United States\n\nThe State of Emergency declaration opens up $50 billion in funding for the president, which he detailed in a press conference in the Rose Garden at the White House.\n\nTrump urged every state to set up emergency operations centers.\n\n\"You're going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world,\" he said, as top executives from health care companies and medical labs stood with the president.\n\nThe president focused primarily on increasing the number of testing kits available for sick patients who needed to be diagnosed for the virus.\n\nExecutives from Walmart, CVS, Target, and Walgreens promised to work with the president to increase testing levels and care for individuals.\n\n\"The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,\" he said.\n\nDoug McMillon from Walmart said that the company was \"eager\" to assist the president.\n\n\"Given what we're facing, that's certainly important to do,\" he said. \"We should all be doing that.\"\n\nBrian Cornell of Target acknowledged that the CEOs present were typically competitors in the medical and supply industry.\n\n\"Normally, you'd view us as competitors, but today we're focused on a common competitor, and that's defeating the spread of the coronavirus,\" he said.\n\nThe president highlighted efforts from companies Roche and Thermo Risher, as well as LabCorp and Quest, to speedily produce tests and promised that the government would quickly approve them for production.\n\nTrump also thanked Google for using its resources and 1,700 engineers to create a website that would help sick Americans locate a testing site.\n\n\"It's going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president also spoke about using his authority to clear the red tape of regulations that might hinder hospitals, doctors, and nursing homes to allow them to properly treat patients infected with the virus.\n\n\"We'll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they're entitled to,\" he said. \"No resource will be spared. Nothing whatsoever.\"\n\nDuring his press conference, he ceded his powerful podium to government medical professionals including Dr. Deborah Birx, who is helping the vice president lead the task force and Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nBirx said that the team had accomplished a great deal behind the scenes in the past weeks, acknowledging that it was \"invisible\" to the press.\n\n\"[T]his intense effort has not only resulted in innovative solutions but an automated high-throughput system, bringing the availability of these quality coronaviral testing to the American people at unprecedented speed,\" she said.\n\nFauci praised Trump's declaration for allowing everyone to act as quickly and efficiently as possible to fight the virus.\n\n\"We still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases, but we'll take care of that,\" he said. \"And ultimately, as the President said, this will end.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_spiering@breitbart.com", "name": "Charlie Spiering", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cornell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Cornell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_McMillon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug McMillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walgreens", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walgreens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Pharmacy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CVS Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Before imposing a travel ban, Trump would have to \"consult with Congress,\" the legislation dictates.\n\nLikewise, Democrat Senators Christopher Murphy (D-CT), Christopher Coons (D-DE), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have introduced legislation to stop Trump's recent expansion of a travel ban on some legal immigration from Burma, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Sudan, along with Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.\n\nThe legislation states:\n\nNo funds, resources, or fees made available to the Secretary of Homeland Security, or to any other official of a Federal agency, by any Act of Congress for any fiscal year may be used to implement or enforce Presidential Proclamation 9983 ... which restricts the entry into the United States of nationals of certain countries.\n\nThe effort to end America's ability to implement travel bans comes as the number of coronavirus cases hits 1,107 nationwide, including 32 deaths.\n\nDemocrats' fight to keep U.S. borders open to the world during the spread of the coronavirus was echoed by 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidate Sen.

'Medicare for All'", "body": "CLAIM: South Korea is making progress because it has a single-payer health care system like \"Medicare for All.\"\n\nVERDICT: False. So does Italy, and South Korea has benefited from the power of private industry in the fight.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) claimed this week that the U.S. faces a \"severe disadvantage\" in the fight against coronavirus because it does not have universal health care, or treat health care as a government-guaranteed \"right.\"\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who supports Sanders, made a similar argument on Twitter on Thursday, claiming that South Korea has had relative success in fighting coronavirus because it has single-payer health care:\n\nOcasio-Cortez is right that South Korea, where new cases are declining, has single-payer health care. So does Italy, where coronavirus has run amok despite early testing. Single-payer health care does not explain the difference.\n\nA new report by Reuters that compares South Korea and Italy notes that South Korea's aggressive coronavirus testing system has been accompanied by a widespread system of electronic surveillance that tracks potential contacts of those infected. \"South Korea's system is an intrusive mandatory measure that depends on people surrendering what, for many in Europe and America, would be a fundamental right of privacy,\" Reuters notes.\n\nSouth Korea has also had more practice with viral outbreaks, and developed its current system after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2015. Western countries have far less experience with such viruses.\n\nMoreover, CNN reports, South Korea's aggressive testing was made possible because of a private company called Seegene that was able to ramp up production. The government cut the usual red tape to allow the kits to be made.\n\nSanders and Ocasio-Cortez have attacked the private health care industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, demonizing the profit motive in producing life-saving medicines -- which is the reason many are initially produced.\n\nEarlier this week, health insurance companies promised President Donald Trump that coronavirus testing would be free for all Americans who needed it, without any copays. That goal was achieved without \"Medicare for All.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.
