But it is going to pass.\n\nIt is an unpleasant respiratory illness, but it is not an organ-destroying horror like Ebola. Precautions are being taken, a vaccine will emerge, and life will continue as usual.\n\nHere are five specific reasons to chill out.\n\n1. Coronavirus is a familiar illness, and not as bad as others. It is from the SARS family -- and less deadly. As Ha'aretz noted, \"the mortality rate from the current disease ranges from 0.5 to 2 percent, and is significantly lower than the mortality rate from the 2002 SARS outbreak (9.5 percent) and much lower than the 2012 SARS outbreak (34.4 percent). It may even be close to the mortality rate from an ordinary flu outbreak in the United States.\"\n\n2. The U.S. response has been exceptionally good. There have only been 16 cases thus far, none deadly. President Donald Trump bought precious time by stopping travel to China last month -- a step critics said was overly drastic. Democrats are screaming about funding and staff cuts that never actually happened. The latest outrage: the White House is controlling the message. As they should! The people in lab coats are not always good communicators.\n\n3. We are going to have a vaccine soon. There are private companies in the U.S. and around the world racing to develop a vaccine -- not just because of the urgent public health need, but because whoever finds it first stands to make a lot of money. (This is where the profit motive, and the pharmaceutical industry, are so crucial -- contrary to what Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, and other Democrats running for president have been saying about them.)\n\n4. China is going to be all right. The number of cases in China sounds large -- until you consider the size of China. True, the Chinese government has been duplicitous about coronavirus, as it is about everything. (Amartya Sen famously observed that India, unlike China, has never suffered famine because India has a free press.) And U.S. firms are learning a long-overdue lesson about the risks of investing there. But China will eventually pull through.\n\n5. The same people who want you to panic about coronavirus want you to panic about everything. The news business thrives on chaos. In addition, the media want to destroy Trump, which is why they spread the Russia collusion hoax. Coronavirus is not a hoax, but pundits should be asked if they cared enough about flu -- which kills far more people -- to get their shot this year. If not, ignore them. Remember to wash your hands, and stay cool.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.

Bloomberg claimed that Trump had \"fired\" a pandemic specialist at the White House, and \"defunded\" the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The implication: Trump was to blame for the spread of coronavirus -- even though there have been just over a dozen cases and no fatalities in the U.S.\n\nThe truth: the pandemic specialist had left voluntarily during a reorganization of the bloated National Security Council (NSC), and the CDC cuts -- as the agency wound down its Ebola response -- were only proposed, not enacted.\n\nThe AP confirmed Thursday, in an article titled \"AP FACT CHECK: Democrats distort coronavirus readiness,\" that much of what Democrats are saying about Trump's response to the coronavirus challenge is simply not true:\n\nDemocratic presidential contenders are describing the federal infectious-disease bureaucracy as rudderless and ill-prepared for the coronavirus threat because of budget cuts and ham-handed leadership by President Donald Trump. That's a distorted picture. For starters, Trump hasn't succeeded in cutting the budget.\n\nHe's proposed cuts but Congress ignored him and increased financing instead. The National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention aren't suffering from budget cuts that never took effect.\n\n...\n\nSome public health experts say a bigger concern than White House budgets is the steady erosion of a CDC grant program for state and local public health emergency preparedness -- the front lines in detecting and battling new disease. But that decline was set in motion by a congressional budget measure that predates Trump.\n\n...\n\n\"The CDC's response has been excellent, as it has been in the past,\" said John Auerbach, president of the nonpartisan Trust for America's Health, which works with government at all levels to improve the nation's response to high-risk health crises. Some Democrats have charged that Trump decimated the nation's public health leadership, but Auerbach said CDC's top scientific ranks have remained stable during the past three years.\n\nRead the full AP fact check here.\n\nThe changes in the Trump administration -- the restructuring and the proposed CDC cuts -- were overdue, as the Ebola crisis had faded. It was bad luck that a new public health crisis emerged at that precise moment.\n\nBut it was also fortunate that President Trump departed from protocol in one important way, widely criticized at the time: by shutting down travel from China, something the AP says is not typically done, he likely prevented a larger outbreak and bought the government precious time to prepare a response and educate the public.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.

Once again.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced that he will deliver a press conference on his administration's response to the virus and took aim at the establishment media for making the illness \"look as bad as possible.\"\n\n\"Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) & @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible. Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action. USA in great shape!\" the president wrote on Twitter. \"I will be having a News Conference at the White House, on this subject, today at 6:00 P.M. CDC representatives, and others, will be there. Thank you!\"\n\nWhile returning from India on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump also criticized Democrat presidential candidates for accusing his administration of mishandling the outbreak.\n\n\"CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world. It was opposed by the Dems, \"too soon\", but turned out to be the correct decision. No matter how well we do, however, the Democrats talking point is that we are doing badly,\" the president wrote. \"If the virus disappeared tomorrow, they would say we did a really poor, and even incompetent, job. Not fair, but it is what it is. So far, by the way, we have not had one death. Let's keep it that way!\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned that Americans could see \"significant disruption\" if the virus continues to spread in the U.S.\n\n\"Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters.",

"body": "The southern Chinese city of Shenzhen wants local restaurants to take dogs and cats off their menus as the country clamps down on the wildlife trade scientists suspect led to the deadly coronavirus outbreak.\n\nReuters reports a new city regulation states only nine meats that are permitted for consumption, including pork, chicken, beef and rabbit, as well as fish and seafood.\n\n\"Banning the consumption of wild animals is a common practice in developed countries and is a universal requirement of modern civilization,\" the notice said.\n\nApart from dogs, the new Shenzhen act bars snake, frog and turtle meat from the dinner table.\n\nA ban on eating dog and cat meat in Shenzhen would be \"extremely welcome,\" said Peter Li, China policy expert for Humane Society International, an animal welfare group.\n\n\"Although the trade in Shenzhen is fairly small compared with the rest of [Guangdong] province, Shenzhen is still a huge city and is larger than Wuhan, so this would be very significant and could even have a domino effect with other cities following.\"\n\nThe public will have until Thursday to respond to the draft proposal, according to Reuters.\n\nThe annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival is one of the most controversial food festivals in China and sees thousands of dogs cruelly killed, skinned and cooked with blow-torches before being eaten by the locals, as Breitbart News has reported.\n\nThe festival began in 2010 and occurs every year on the first day of the summer solstice. Those who partake believe that eating dog meat cools the body in the summer months.\n\nEach year in China, over 10 million dogs and four million cats are reportedly murdered for their meat. Most of these dogs are domestic pets stolen from families or strays taken from the streets and sent to notorious slaughter houses.\n\nMost slaughter operations have closed in the past two months because of restrictions on moving dogs across provincial borders, Li said.\n\nChina's top legislative committee on Monday also passed new legislation to ban all trade and consumption of wild animals.\n\nBeijing is yet to revise its wild animal protection law, but the passage of the proposal was \"essential\" and \"urgent\" in helping the country win its war against the epidemic, wrote state newspaper People's Daily.\n\nThe exact source of the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, remains unconfirmed.

Illegally Entering U.S. in FY2020", "body": "U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended 1,155 Chinese migrants this fiscal year after they illegally entered from Mexico, Canada, or coastal boundaries. More than 95 percent came over the southwestern border between October 1, 2019, and January 31, 2020.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection officials responded to an inquiry from Breitbart Texas and reported that Border Patrol agents apprehended 1,155 Chinese nationals who illegally crossed into the United States. Of those, 1,114 were apprehended after crossing between ports of entry in the nine Border Patrol sectors making up the southwestern border with Mexico. Of the remaining, 17 were apprehended after illegally crossing the Canadian border and 24 were apprehended along coastal boundaries.\n\nBreitbart Texas investigated the matter after Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley, Laredo, and Del Rio Sectors commented on the increasing numbers of Chinese migrants appearing in their sectors.\n\nDuring Fiscal Year 2019, which ended on September 30, CBP reports show that Border Patrol agents apprehended 2,134 Chinese migrants after they illegally entered the U.S. The 1,155 apprehended during the first four months of FY2020 represents more than half of the total arrested during the entire previous year. In FY19, agents arrested 2,060 along the southwestern border, 47 along the northern border, and 27 along coastal boundaries.\n\nBreitbart Texas asked Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston if the Chinese migrants represent a public health threat amid Coronavirus concerns. Dr. Hotez downplayed any threat due to the incubation period of the virus, currently estimated to be up to 14 days, according to the CDC. He did not believe the migrants posed a significant threat at this time.\n\nHowever, Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera, in his capacity as spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council and Local 3307 (in the Rio Grande Valley Sector), told Breitbart Texas that some Chinese migrants arrive at the U.S. border within five to eight days after leaving their homeland. He also said some take as long as two months to complete their journey.\n\nCBP officials responded to the issue of Chinese migrants as a public health threat, stating, \"This fiscal year, the U.S. Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley Sector, has seen an increase in the number of Chinese nationals being apprehended, but the significance of that increase should not be overstated.\"\n\nThe official reported that migrants from more than 148 countries have been arrested so far this fiscal year after they illegally entered the U.S.\n\n\"During the peak of the humanitarian crisis (May 2019), we were apprehending around 3 Chinese nationals per day,\" the CBP official stated. \" This year we are seeing approximately 5 per day.\"\n\nCBP says that operationally, this is a very manageable number and represents an extremely small percentage of the overall daily apprehension totals. So far this year, Border Patrol agents apprehended 130,976 migrants who illegally crossed the southwest border into the U.S., according to CBP's Southwest Border Migration Report. Chinese migrants make up 1,114 of that total (less than one percent).\n\n\"Although we haven't encountered any issues to date, we do have measures in place to identify individuals with signs of illness who may be potentially infected with a communicable disease,\" CBP officials stated.\n\nAgent Cabrera explained some of the protocols put in place for Chinese migrants. He said agents follow specific protocols to isolate migrants they apprehend who came from China and those who are traveling with them. They also monitor the migrants for any symptoms and immediately move them to hospitals for treatment if necessary.\n\nMexican cartels engaged in global migrant smuggling likely do not follow isolation or health monitoring protocols. Breitbart Texas has frequently reported on the smuggling of Chinese migrants. There does not appear to be a way to reliably determine if migrants from countries other than China are transported with or warehoused in Mexico with Chinese nationals.\n\nIn January, Laredo Sector Border Patrol agents found 63 migrants locked inside a tractor-trailer about 60 miles north of the Mexican border. The migrants came to the U.S. from eight countries, including China.\n\nAlso in January, Yuma Sector agents apprehended a group of 10 Chinese migrants locked in the toolbox of a pickup truck. A few weeks earlier, 11 more were found locked in a moving truck in California.\n\nIn November, Breitbart News witnessed the apprehension of three more Chinese nationals after they crossed the Rio Grande and were picked up by a human smuggler in Texas.\n\nBefore crossing the border into the U.S., cartel smugglers frequently move migrants in packed tractor-trailers, crowded box trucks, and other means of conveyance. They are warehoused in crowded stash houses in Mexico and the United States.\n\nIn September 2019, Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents teamed up with the Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office to raid a stash house holding nine Chinese nationals, Breitbart Texas reported.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/02/24/study-china-lied-wuhan-virus-did-not-originate-in-meat-market/", "title": "Study: China Lied, Wuhan Virus Did Not Originate in Meat Market", "body": "Chinese scientists have concluded that the Wuhan coronavirus did not originate at a wild meat market as the Communist Party had previously asserted, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.\n\nAfter weeks of the never-before-seen virus infecting people in the city of 11 million in December, Chinese authorities shut down the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where people were allowed to sell wild animals for meat relatively freely, on January 1. Chinese officials did not make the viral outbreak public until January 20, so doctors at Wuhan hospitals did not properly isolate patients, exposing themselves and sensitive patients to the virus.\n\nChinese officials insisted that the evidence suggested the new coronavirus jumped from animals to humans at the Huanan market.\n\n\"The origin of the new coronavirus is the wildlife sold illegally in a Wuhan seafood market,\" Gao Fu, director of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told a briefing in January, shortly after Beijing announced the outbreak. Gao's agency claimed as evidence that, of 33 samples taken from early patients that month, 31 were directly traceable back to the part of the market where individuals sold wildlife for eating.\n\nNow, a joint study released Thursday by Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Institute for Brain Research concludes that \"the SARS-CoV-2 source at the ... market was imported from elsewhere. ... The crowded market then boosted SARS-CoV-2 circulation and spread it to the whole city in early December 2019.\"\n\nCaixin Global noted in its report on the study that it has yet to be peer-reviewed, a process many in academia deem necessary to confirm that a study's findings are legitimate. It detailed how the study traced the origins of the virus in 93 different samples. If the virus had originated at the market, all samples would have been traceable there, but the researchers found otherwise:\n\nScientists used gene sequencing technology from 93 virus samples and analyzed their haplotypes -- groups of genes inherited together from a single parent organism. They found that all the samples with a reported link to the market contained the same haplotype, which they called H1.\n\nBut when the scientists dug deeper, they found that three more-ancestral haplotypes -- H3, H13 and H38 -- appeared in several cases with no reported ties to the market, including one in the southern city of Shenzhen and another in the United States.\n\nThat makes it relatively likely that the virus was introduced into the market from outside and began passing between people earlier than previously thought, according to the study.\n\nThe study's estimate for when the virus started spreading is the earliest yet on record, suggesting that the virus may have first begun spreading in Wuhan as early as November 2019. It condemned the Chinese communist regime for failing to alert residents earlier about the outbreak to ensure that people took safety precautions, particularly at crowded events and in hospitals: \"If the warning [after the market shut down in January] had attracted more attention, the number of cases both nationally and globally in mid-to-late January would have been reduced.\"\n\nThe latest study joins a much earlier one published in the medical journal The Lancet in January, which also called into question the official claim that the Wuhan wildlife meat market was responsible for the outbreak. That study found a case in which a patient with no links to the market got sick on December 1, one of the first to be identified as a patient. Of the 41 patients studied, 13 did not appear to have any connection to the market.\n\nHuang Chaolin, one of the doctors who wrote the Lancet study, told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua that the new case did not necessarily mean that the virus did not originate at the market, but that there may be more than one source responsible for the spread of the disease.\n\nThe Lancet study did not prevent a frenzy to identify the wild meat allegedly responsible for the virus, resulting in a wide variety of theories on whether bats, snakes, mice, badgers, or other pests could have carried the disease. As there is little supervision in what sorts of animals people bring to the market and most are killed live on site, even confirmation of the market as the source of the virus would leave many questions unanswered. Dr. Emily Landon at the University of Chicago explains:\n\nThese markets have been known to transmit viruses before. For cultural reasons in the region, people want to see the specific animals they're buying be slaughtered in front of them, so they know they're receiving the products they paid for. That means there's a lot of skinning of dead animals in front of shoppers and, as a result, aerosolizing of all sorts of things, which is why these crowded markets are common places for viruses to jump from animals to people. It's actually how SARS, another coronavirus, started in 2003.\n\nAdding to the initial confusion were reports on video allegedly showing the Wuhan market, but instead showing locations elsewhere in Southeast Asia that had no known ties to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nChina is nonetheless considering a nationwide ban on wild meat to prevent other potential outbreaks. The Communist Party has yet to address the most recent study potentially absolving the meat market.\n\nAt press time, global health officials have identified 79,544 cases of coronavirus worldwide, most in China, Over 2,600 people have died after being diagnosed with the virus. For weeks, Chinese officials reportedly denied patients with clear coronavirus symptoms the testing kit necessary to confirm the outbreak, suggesting the number of cases in the country is much higher than what government officials have documented.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com", "name": "Frances

Trying to 'Strangle Us'", "body": "Experts on China at a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) panel on Thursday sounded the alarm about the Communist nation's efforts to defeat the United States and without ever having to fire a shot.\n\nThe experts on the panel, hosted by the Committee on the Present Danger: China, warned that China is laying the groundwork to replace the U.S. as the world's superpower, which will have profound implications for Americans.\n\nChina expert and author Gordon Chang said China is becoming more belligerent to the U.S. -- not less -- and is trying to lay the groundwork in China to blame the coronavirus on the United States.\n\nChina recently had a famous health expert -- a \"hero\" of fighting the SARS epidemic -- raise doubts in China Daily, a Chinese state-run media outlet, that the coronavirus originated in China.\n\nThe Chinese Communist government is \"laying the theoretical foundation that the U.S. spread disease in their country,\" Chang said.\n\nChang also laid out remarks and actions that Chinese leaders have made or the Chinese military has done that show hostility to the U.S., such as that China had the right to use force to settle trade disputes, directing blinding lasers at U.S. pilots in Djibouti, and conducting sonic attacks against American diplomats.\n\n\"Why do we maintain a cordial relationship with a regime that is harming Americans?\" he asked.\n\nChang also mentioned a recent news report that said China plans to buy 1.4 million units of body armor, citing potential military conflicts with \"Taiwan secessionists\" and \"U.S. provocations.\"\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is \"warning us about what he wants to do,\" Chang said. \"We are in a war, and the enemy is the People's Republic of China.\"\n\nRetired Air Force Lt. Gen. Steven L. Kwast, who recently retired and speaks about the threat of China as a private citizen, said China is pursuing a strategy of seeking dominance while \"trying not to awaken the great giant\" -- the U.S.\n\nHe said the plan is to steal U.S. intellectual property, duplicate the technology using their party system, flood the market with that technology, and dominate the market. He said the Chinese are trying to dominate all cutting edge technological markets, including telecommunications, drones, quantum computing, super-computing, and facial recognition software.\n\n\"They have stated openly they see our freedom as an existential threat to their survival over time,\" he said.\n\nHe said if the China dominates 5G networks, through which all telecommunications will transmit, the U.S. could someday find itself in the position of not being able to counter lies and misinformation from China.\n\nChina is trying to \"strangle us [so that] we go out with a whimper,\" he said. Yet, he added, \"We are going about our lives.\"\n\nRep. Scott Perry, a retired Army brigadier general, said that China has already stolen the designs for the U.S.'s most expensive weapons systems, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as well as the C-17, and the F-22.\n\nSean Lin, a former U.S. Army Captain and Ph.D. with Hong Kong Goes On Foundation, said he witnessed firsthand the cruelty of China as a college student during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\n\nHe said he witnessed Chinese tanks rolling over students' heads and bodies. He said today, one only needed to look at the way Beijing is treating China's Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang Province.\n\nHe said China was harvesting organs from them for profit. He said a million people dying in China is \"just a number\" to the government.\n\n\"Communist regime is the enemy of all humanity,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristina_wong@breitbart.com", "name": "Kristina Wong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Political_Action_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Political Action Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_the_Present_Danger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Committee on the Present Danger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Daily", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China Daily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People's Liberation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djibouti", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Djibouti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Djibouti"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_L._Kwast", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven L.

Already 20 South Korean soldiers and one American have tested positive.\n\nIn response the allies are taking aggressive measures to guard against a viral outbreak and are even considering curtailing a key joint military exercise, something experts say is inevitable because if the virus were to spread through the ranks it could significantly weaken their ability to fight if necessary.\n\n\"In the military, soldiers are living as a group. So even if just one person contracts the virus at his base, its aftermath would be really tremendous,\" said Kim Dae-young, an analyst at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy. \"This year, no military training can be the best option.\"\n\nThe virus has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide, mostly in China, though over the past week South Korea has become the second-worst affected country after an outbreak centered in the southeast around its fourth-largest city, Daegu.\n\nSouth Korea boasts a 600,000-strong military, while the U.S. stations 28,500 troops in the country largely as a deterrent to possible North Korean aggression. Daegu, with a population of about 2.5 million people, is near four American bases.\n\nThe United States Forces Korea on Monday said that a USFK widowed dependent tested positive for the virus. On Wednesday the U.S. reported that a 23-year-old soldier had tested positive and would be treated at Camp Humphreys near Seoul. It said the soldier was originally based at Camp Carroll near Daegu.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_caplan@breitbart.com", "name": "Joshua Caplan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Korean Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles International Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Korea_Army", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Korea Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incheon_International_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incheon International Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoongAng_Ilbo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JoongAng Ilbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daegu", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daegu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Daegu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Humphreys", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camp Humphreys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forces_Korea", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Forces Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Educational_and_Academic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Educational and Academic", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/neonbrand-n-YceUl10I0-unsplash.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-5548675", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 2286, "pinterest": 3}, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 2289, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1464042938", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-28", "time": "03:24:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-28T03:24:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-28T01:45:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/02/27/gop-sen-mike-braun-schumer-trying-to-weaponize-coronavirus-politically/", "title": "Mike Braun: 'Schumer Trying to Weaponize Coronavirus Politically'", "body": "Indiana Sen. Mike Braun (R) affirmed that the United States is \"in as good a shape\" and \"as prepared\" as any nation to manage the coronavirus, given the infrastructure the country has, while Democrats like Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are trying to \"weaponize\" the infection to win political points.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart News Thursday, Braun said he was in the \"behind closed door meeting\" on Tuesday and concluded as a result that, given the infrastructure the country has, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the U.S. is ready to manage a spread of infection.\n\nBraun stressed this coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 infection \"should be an eye-opener for all of the world\" and that the U.S. must remain \"vigilant\":\n\nI think it's going to be an increasing issue over time ... And the fact is, this happened somewhere else, where they didn't have the benefit of that [infrastructure]. We've had very few instances here, but we need to be vigilant. We need to be prepared, like it could happen here. I just think that we, of any country, are going to be in as good a shape to deal with it. And it'll play itself out. The markets are going to be hurt because real economic activity has been disrupted.\n\nBraun said the spread of the COVID-19 infection reveals quite a bit about China.\n\n\"Its weaknesses, in terms of are we getting the full information,\" he explained:\n\nThey obviously do not have the infrastructure to deal with it. You could see that with the scrambling, where they were building hospitals, kind of on demand from it. I don't think they have the equivalent of the CDC, the NIH, the Department of Homeland Security, all of that, and I think that's why it mushroomed and ballooned.\n\nThe senator suggests American companies will likely begin to scrutinize their relationships with China.\n\n\"Many companies are going to start looking at their supply chain,\" he said. \"You know how deep it is in China, and probably get an eye-opener about what to do about that down the road.\"\n\nHe added:\n\nWhen you've got places - where they think it might have started with a bat at a food market - that is scary. And I think they've got probably some institutions and components of their culture that was the kind of public setting for something like this to arise, and it's probably the biggest setback they had as a country, even more so than grappling with tariffs and taking them on for their bad behavior as world trading partners.\n\nSo, I think they've had a one-two blow that, oh, probably, hopefully, will be an eye opener to them to see how they might change things down the road. I think that, as far as us, we will deal with it as well as any other country. And sadly, a lot of it is unknown, in terms of how expansive it's going to get. It is a virulent strain of coronavirus, and we need to have a heads-up accordingly.\n\nBraun's comments about Schumer using the coronavirus infection as a political weapon echoed what the Associated Press revealed in its fact check Thursday that observed Democrat presidential candidates are distorting the truth to Americans about the country's readiness to manage the virus.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dr_susan_berry@breitbart.com", "name": "Dr. Susan Berry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Braun", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Braun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/09/Chuck-Schumer.png", "eventUri": null, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "shares": {"facebook": 2193}, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 2193, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1463603436", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-27", "time": "18:33:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-27T18:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-27T18:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.501960813999176, "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/02/27/ocasio-cortez-pence-not-qualified-to-lead-coronavirus-effort-he-literally-does-not-believe-in-science/", "title": "Ocasio-Cortez: Pence 'Not Qualified' to Lead Coronavirus Effort", "body": "Rep.

We should be working hand in hand,\" he said. Besides the diplomatic blowback, he said, the travel ban \"probably doesn't make sense,\" since the outbreak has already spread to several other countries. [Emphasis added]\n\n\"At this juncture, it's going to be very hard to contain the virus,\" Bera told POLITICO, noting that his priority now is to get CDC's epidemiologists into China to study the origin of the pandemic. [Emphasis added]\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who is running to be the 2020 Democrat presidential nominee, refused to commit to closing America's borders amid global disease and virus outbreaks like the coronavirus during this week's CBS Democrat debate.\n\nLikewise, the George Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) denounced Trump's travel ban to protect Americans from the coronavirus, claiming travel bans \"do more harm than good.\"\n\n\"These measures are extraordinary incursions on liberty and fly in the face of considerable evidence that travel bans and quarantines can do more harm than good, including studies from the World Health Organization itself,\" the ACLU's Jay Stanley said in a statement.\n\nIn 2017, Breitbart News reported on a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) that warned of the potential for a deadly disease outbreak across the U.S. if proper illegal and legal immigration controls were not implemented.\n\nThe FAIR report noted:\n\nMost illnesses are spread by contact with infected people, livestock or agricultural produce. As a result, researchers have concluded that the international movement of people is a significant factor in disease outbreaks: 'Mobile populations can link zones of disease emergence to low prevalence or non-endemic areas through rapid or high-volume international movements, or both.\n\nEvery year, current legal immigration laws allow for nearly half a million Chinese students to study at American schools -- delivering more than $10 billion worth of university fees. Likewise, since 2010, tech corporations like Amazon and Microsoft have helped bring close to 60,000 Chinese workers into the U.S. labor market.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news",

Bernie Sanders emerged as the frontrunner for the Democratic Party's nomination for president after the Nevada caucuses last weekend.\n\nThe \"democratic socialist\" is still the frontrunner, despite former Vice President Joe Biden's win in South Carolina on Saturday. He is widely viewed as the least likely to defeat President Donald Trump in November's general election.\n\nThere are no alternatives to a Sanders-Biden contest, which Biden may struggle to win. The Mike Bloomberg bubble burst at the Nevada debate, and may not recover if Sanders wins California handily on Super Tuesday.\n\nSanders's surge is itself the result of a despair that seized many Democrats after the Iowa debate, when it seemed none of the candidates could beat Trump. If they were to lose anyway, better to vote for a sentimental favorite.\n\nSo the rise of Sanders is the result of one kind of panic, and the coronavirus panic is another: the reaction of those who believe the \"fake news\" and have convinced themselves that President Trump really is incompetent in a crisis.\n\nYou do not need the majority of people to panic to create a panic. You just need a significant proportion of people, reacting at the same time. And the signal to panic was sent last Tuesday by CDC official Dr. Nancy Messonnier.\n\nDr. Messioner said: \"We expect we will see community spread in this country ... It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\"\n\nHer words had an innocuous, scientific meaning: she was predicting there would be some spread of coronavirus (which there has been) and that some people would become seriously ill as a result.\n\nWhat she did not say -- yet what is equally true -- is that \"community spread\" could be limited, and that we already know that only a small proportion of those who have become infected (and no children!) have become severely ill.\n\nMessonnier is the sister of former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was once suspected of trying to help remove the president from office. But there was no conspiracy at work -- rather, just the ordinary problem of scientists not being very good at communicating to the public, and not realizing that in a climate of uncertainty, enough people will seize on small bits of information and give them the worst interpretation: we're all gonna die!\n\nThe illness is real, and the fear is real, but the reality of coronavirus is not that scary. What gave coronavirus its particular punch is there was already a large group of people in a state of fear, ready -- or even eager -- to panic.\n\nFor five years, the media have been telling us that Donald Trump is not just a buffoon and a criminal, but also a danger to national security. (Those words were literally used over and over again in the Senate impeachment trial.) Until late last year, Democrats and journalists hyped every possible speck of bad economic news -- in a tsunami of good data -- to frighten the public into believing a recession was on the way. (Some may even have believed it.)\n\nThe economy kept rolling, and Trump kept succeeding. But a good proportion of the general public refused to see it, or could not see it. Democrats, in particular, believed that the country was on the wrong track. Sanders's rise suggested that they would not be able to remove the cause of their fears at the ballot box, after failing in the Senate, and the coronavirus news made enough of them believe millions of people could suffer \"severe illness\" as a result.\n\nTrump's opponents, and those who still live in fear of what he could do, might not, under ordinary circumstances, be able to vote him out. But they still have a \"vote\" in public sentiment. Their panic is their power. Markets are largely about the public mood, and even \"fake news\" narratives have impact, if enough people react.\n\nIronically, not being able to vote Trump out of office has partly triggered a panic that has given Trump opponents a chance of doing so.\n\nPresident Trump has managed coronavirus largely as he should -- better, in fact, because he closed travel to China early, over objections. He has also taken charge of the administration's message, wisely. But there is little he, or his supporters, can do to stop panic by those determined, or inclined, to do so.\n\nThe best response is to keep on keeping on: \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" as FDR said. And, note: at least it didn't happen in October.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.

To the Global Times, it is healthy America that is trying to distract the rest of the world from China's narrative of the epidemic:\n\nThe US is the only major country that doesn't guarantee healthcare to its citizens as a human right. It's estimated about 30,000 people in the US die every year because they can't afford medical treatment, according to Physicians for a National Health Program. In the midst of such an incomplete system, it is unfortunately easy to understand why there are so many deaths from the seasonal flu.\n\nTo distract from this travesty, it is easy to understand why the US corporate media, with similar profit motivations as the drug and pharmaceutical companies, would rather sensationalize COVID-19 than adequately focus on domestic health disasters. Fear helps generate profit and distracts Americans from understanding the social problems around them.\n\nAfter once again quoting politically useful praise from the World Health Organization (WHO) - itself under scrutiny for prioritizing good relations with Beijing over frank discussions of the coronavirus threat - the Global Times claimed \"bigotry\" and \"imperialism\" are the only reasons China gets hassled about health crises that are covered without \"compassion\" by Western media:\n\nThe yellow peril stereotype, borrowed from Europe by American white supremacist writers in the 19th century, has long affected the Western cultural psyche. The idea that \"sneaky Asians\" would destroy Western nations became a racist trope used to justify hostility toward societies exploited by colonization and imposed underdevelopment. This explains modern-day delusions from US Senator Tom Cotton about biological warfare.\n\nIn spite of that chronic underdevelopment however, China has come a long way since achieving sovereignty. Though ever-evolving and still in development, China's healthcare system has worked to deliver free medical treatment to all COVID-19 patients. The government constructed a COVID-19 focused improvised hospital within 10 days. The lockdown of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak in Central China's Hubei Province, has allowed for the first decline in new cases in weeks. Taking decisive steps has helped China, and specifically Wuhan, repel initial mistakes and help stabilize the virus outbreak.\n\nAn even more heated Global Times screed on Tuesday accused American politicians, corporations, and media of using the coronavirus story to \"promote white supremacist racism and the advantage of their political system\" by \"fabricating\" a treat from China against the free world.\n\nThis story included China's latest obsessive mention of influenza deaths in the United States, a talking point that ignores the fact that the coronavirus turned out to be much more dangerous than the flu and far more dangerous than the Chinese Communist Party was willing to admit until recently.\n\nThe Global Times folded the coronavirus into Beijing's standard political narrative that jealous Western powers, especially the United States, are peddling \"conspiracy theories\" and \"bashing China\" to thwart its ascension to great power status. This particular iteration of the Beijing narrative included a veiled threat that \"attempts to force China into a downfall will backfire\" because so much of the global industrial chain runs through China, thanks to decades of globalism.\n\nThe Global Times was especially contemptuous of prominent China critics like White House adviser Peter Navarro and Republican Senators Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, all of whom the Chinese paper comically branded as \"neoconservatives\":\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro once described China as a \"disease incubator,\" a claim regarded by many as racist and beyond the moral baseline of human civilization.\n\nRepublican Senator Tom Cotton has repeatedly slammed the Communist Party of China over the coronavirus outbreak and claimed the virus is \"a man-made bioweapon that leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\"\n\nChinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai dismissed to the biological weapons theory as \"absolutely crazy,\" and warned such allegations could stir up suspicion, rumors, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and could \"harm our joint efforts to combat the virus.\"\n\nCotton's allegation has been largely debunked by biological experts quoted in the media including the Washington Post and the Guardian.\n\nA Huffington Post story titled \"Don't listen to Sen. Tom Cotton about Coronavirus,\" writes that \"spreading misinformation and panic in a weeks-long meltdown over the disease\" by quoting multiple experts saying his assertion is \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Tom Cotton is far more dangerous than the Coronavirus,\" a Twitter user commented on Cotton's anti-China tweet.\n\nThe latter slam on Cotton is amusing not just because the Global Times thinks one random Twitter user can humble a senator, but because Chinese readers of the Global Times cannot access Twitter legally since their government bans the platform.\n\nAs for Senator Rubio, he annoyed the Chinese Communists by accusing the World Health Organization of being unduly concerned with Beijing's feelings instead of pulling out all the stops to combat the coronavirus, and he wants WHO to extend membership status to Taiwan, a move bitterly opposed by China because it would confer national legitimacy on what the Chinese see as a rogue province.\n\n\"Rubio has an emotional affinity with, in additional to financial support of, Taiwan, because they both have a tendency to betray their homeland,\" sneered a Chinese academic quoted by the Global Times. By \"Rubio's homeland,\" he meant Cuba, the Communist nation from which Rubio's family fled.\n\nThe Global Times castigated U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross for supposedly welcoming the coronavirus epidemic as an opportunity to reclaim American jobs lost to China, and American businessman Kyle Bass expressing a wish to \"let the Chinese virus rampage through the ranks of the Global Times and the rest of the Communist Party.\"\n\nAs usual, the Chinese state paper left out some important context: Ross began by expressing condolences for the coronavirus and saying he did not want to \"talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,\" but he thought business leaders would take note of the pattern of disease epidemics disrupting Chinese supply chains.\n\nBass later deleted his tweet because he \"felt that it was too harsh for the rank-and-file\" employees of the Global Times, but he said the paper itself was still a \"simple belligerent tabloid designed to stir controversy with western media and commentators,\" and he insisted he would never apologize to a Chinese regime that proved itself a \"disgrace to humanity\" by arresting and punishing early whistleblowers on the Wuhan virus such as the late Dr. Li Wenliang.\n\nChina's remorseless efforts to spin the coronavirus epidemic to its advantage, frequently using bits of rhetoric it gleans from American politicians and media - like the constant attacks on the U.S. healthcare system launched by Democrats seeking to take control of it - are unlikely to convince people around the world who can see with their own eyes that Beijing concealed the damaging truth about the epidemic for as long as it could, at a cost to the rest of the world that would be much greater without the travel restrictions China despises.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hayward@breitbart.com", "name": "John Hayward", "type":
