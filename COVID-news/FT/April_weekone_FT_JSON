Four flights departed from Lima, one from Oakland and one from Tokyo.\n\nLondon's involvement stands in marked contrast to its decision to shun an EU scheme to jointly procure ventilators and other medical equipment to combat coronavirus. It also highlights how the pandemic has focused attention on little-heralded yet potentially vital EU arrangements that the UK faces important choices on whether to join once the Brexit transition period ends in December.\n\n\"The UK activated the [civil protection mechanism] as part of our international response to coronavirus, which helped repatriate EU citizens,\" said a UK official. \"It is standard practice to use the [mechanism] to recover costs in these situations.\"\n\nThe official said that Britain \"remains a member of and contributor to\" the mechanism throughout the Brexit transition period. \"As such we are entitled to activate the mechanism in response to a crisis during this time.\"\n\nThe commission data also show that, since the start of the crisis, about 200 Britons have been repatriated thanks to flights organised by EU countries with support from the mechanism.\n\nThey include four UK citizens who made it home from Georgia on a flight organised by the Latvian government, and 85 brought back on an aircraft the Irish government arranged for people stranded in Peru.\n\n\"We have helped bring back so far some 200 UK nationals on member states' flights financed by the EU,\" said Janez Lenarcic, the EU commissioner for crisis management. \"We have done this in a spirit of good co-operation to get people home and reunite families.\"\n\nSince the start of the crisis, the EU civil protection mechanism has supported a total of 60 flights, and it is reviewing requests from governments to help with over 200 more.\n\nEU diplomats said the co-operation was common sense at a time when all countries were grappling with the challenge of getting thousands of citizens home amid the large-scale shutdown of the commercial aviation industry.\n\nUnlike some other EU schemes, the civil protection mechanism is open to other countries and currently has six \"participating states\" from outside the bloc including Serbia, Iceland and Turkey. But EU officials said Britain had so far given no indication that it intended to continue participating after the Brexit transition period ended.\n\nA British government document setting out its plans for the UK's future relationship with the EU does not mention civil protection, even though the bloc's negotiating mandate does foresee the possibility of co-operation in this area.\n\nRosa Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe, a think-tank, said repatriation flights were one of a \"whole host of issues\" around potential joint UK-EU action highlighted by the pandemic, ranging from consular collaboration to the search for a coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\"There is scope to continue that kind of co-operation, which is very practical and not really ideological,\" she added. The UK approach to repatriation flights appeared to be a case of \"if they can do it quietly, they will\", she said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"},

time in order to force companies to make components for critical life-saving masks and ventilators for coronavirus patients.\n\n\"I have issued an order under the Defense Production Act to more fully ensure that domestic manufacturers can produce ventilators needed to save American lives,\" Mr Trump said in a statement.\n\nSoon after, he followed up with another order to use his powers under the act to acquire N-95 respirators from 3M, the US manufacturer.\n\nThe president's expanded use of the act, which gives the government powers to essentially take over parts of the industrial base for national emergencies, comes as ventilators and N95 face masks are in short supply while the number of coronavirus cases soar.\n\nMr Trump said it would help companies -- including General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, ResMed, Royal Philips, and Vyaire Medical -- secure the supplies needed to make the ventilators.\n\n\"I am grateful to these and other domestic manufacturers for ramping up their production of ventilators during this difficult time,\" he said, adding that it would \"save lives by removing obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators\".\n\nThe order comes just days after the president invoked the Korean war-era law to compel General Motors to make ventilators. Mr Trump had faced intense criticism for not invoking it earlier as governors warned that a lack of ventilators was the greatest challenge in dealing with the rapid rise in patients in many parts of the country.\n\nMr Trump's move came as the number of coronavirus cases in the US rose to 236,000, while the death toll rose to 5,648. Doctors and nurses across the US have complained about a lack of key equipment, including masks and other protective gear for medical staff. But hospitals say the biggest shortage is for ventilators, which are essential to help patients who face difficulty breathing after contracting the highly contagious virus.\n\nMr Trump has stepped up efforts to tackle the crisis in recent days, particularly as the scientists on his coronavirus task force have warned that the US could see almost a quarter-million deaths, even if people follow the strict social distancing guidelines that the federal government recommended remain in place until the end of April.\n\nA spokesman for Philips welcomed the move, saying it would help the company scale up from producing 1,000 ventilators now to 2,000 within two months and 4,000 by the end of the third quarter. Each device requires more than 650 specialised components from suppliers in the US, Asia and Europe.\n\n\"The weakest link in this whole chain is the ability of our suppliers to also scale with us. If we want to grow our production fourfold then all our suppliers will also have to grow their production fourfold. The DPA is now [being] used to facilitate exactly that,\" he said. \"There are regions in the US that are in lockdown. The DPA allows that supplier to stay open and to continue the production and delivery of the components.\"\n\nGE welcomed the move, saying it would address supply chain constraints. The group has already doubled its ventilator capacity and is looking to do so again by the end of June.\n\nMedtronic said it was waiting for guidance from the health and human services department about the impact of the move. It said it thought the administration was \"working to ensure that ventilator manufacturers, such as Medtronic, have the necessary supplies we need to continue to increase our production of these critical products\".\n\nMedtronic is looking to increase production from 300 ventilators per week to more than 1,000 by the end of June.\n\nAs well as measures to force US companies into action, the White House has also sought help from other nations, including Russia, which sent a cargo of medical equipment, including ventilators, to the US on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType":

that it has injected a sense of togetherness into polarised societies. But the virus, and the economic lockdowns needed to combat it, also shine a glaring light on existing inequalities -- and even create new ones. Beyond defeating the disease, the great test all countries will soon face is whether current feelings of common purpose will shape society after the crisis. As western leaders learnt in the Great Depression, and after the second world war, to demand collective sacrifice you must offer a social contract that benefits everyone.\n\nToday's crisis is laying bare how far many rich societies fall short of this ideal. Much as the struggle to contain the pandemic has exposed the unpreparedness of health systems, so the brittleness of many countries' economies has been exposed, as governments scramble to stave off mass bankruptcies and cope with mass unemployment. Despite inspirational calls for national mobilisation, we are not really all in this together.\n\nThe economic lockdowns are imposing the greatest cost on those already worst off. Overnight millions of jobs and livelihoods have been lost in hospitality, leisure and related sectors, while better paid knowledge workers often face only the nuisance of working from home. Worse, those in low-wage jobs who can still work are often risking their lives -- as carers and healthcare support workers, but also as shelf stackers, delivery drivers and cleaners.\n\nGovernments' extraordinary budget support for the economy, while necessary, will in some ways make matters worse. Countries that have allowed the emergence of an irregular and precarious labour market are finding it particularly hard to channel financial help to workers with such insecure employment. Meanwhile, vast monetary loosening by central banks will help the asset-rich. Behind it all, underfunded public services are creaking under the burden of applying crisis policies.\n\nThe way we wage war on the virus benefits some at the expense of others. The victims of Covid-19 are overwhelmingly the old. But the biggest victims of the lockdowns are the young and active, who are asked to suspend their education and forgo precious income. Sacrifices are inevitable, but every society must demonstrate how it will offer restitution to those who bear the heaviest burden of national efforts.\n\nRadical reforms -- reversing the prevailing policy direction of the last four decades -- will need to be put on the table. Governments will have to accept a more active role in the economy. They must see public services as investments rather than liabilities, and look for ways to make labour markets less insecure. Redistribution will again be on the agenda; the privileges of the elderly and wealthy in question. Policies until recently considered eccentric, such as basic income and wealth taxes, will have to be in the mix.\n\nThe taboo-breaking measures governments are taking to sustain businesses and incomes during the lockdown are rightly compared to the sort of wartime economy western countries have not experienced for seven decades. The analogy goes still further.\n\nThe leaders who won the war did not wait for victory to plan for what would follow. Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill issued the Atlantic Charter, setting the course for the United Nations, in 1941. The UK published the Beveridge Report, its commitment to a universal welfare state, in 1942. In 1944, the Bretton Woods conference forged the postwar financial architecture.

The order was for 200,000 such masks, according to the German newspaper Tagesspiegel.\n\nBerlin's interior minister Andreas Geisel confirmed that the consignment had been \"confiscated\" in Bangkok and never reached Berlin.\n\n\"We consider that an act of modern piracy,\" he said. \"You don't treat your transatlantic partners like that.\"\n\nThe confiscation came to light after the White House tried to force 3M to export masks to the US from its hub in Singapore, as the federal government exerts its powers to secure critical medical supplies and gear needed to prevent the spread of coronavirus and treat infected patients.\n\n3M this week resisted demands by White House officials to send about 10m N95 respirator masks being produced in Singapore for markets in Asia to the US, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nOn Thursday, US President Donald Trump invoked his authority under a Korean war-era law, the Defense Production Act, with regard to 3M's N95 respirator masks.\n\nThat allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to use \"any and all authority\" to buy \"the number of N95 respirators\" it \"determines to be appropriate\" from 3M and its subsidiaries, according to the wording of the act.\n\n\"We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks,\" Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday evening. \"Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing -- will have a big price to pay!\n\nIn a statement on Friday morning, 3M said the company was going \"above and beyond\" to boost production of N95 masks for the US market. It confirmed that the Trump administration had \"requested that 3M increase the amount of respirators we currently import from our overseas operations into the US\", noting that it had secured the exports from China.\n\n3M also said that the administration had requested that it \"cease exporting respirators\" from the US to Canadian and Latin American markets, but said this would also trigger a humanitarian crisis in those countries where 3M is a \"critical supplier\" and would end backfiring on America, since the US would face retaliation.\n\n\"If that were to occur, the net number of respirators being made available to the United States would actually decrease. That is the opposite of what we and the Administration, on behalf of the American people, both seek,\" 3M said.\n\nJustin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, said on Friday that it would be a \"mistake\" for the US to block exports of essential gear from reaching other countries.\n\n\"There is so much trade that goes back and forth in essential services, and it could end up hurting Americans as much as it hurts anybody else,\" he warned at his daily press briefing.\n\nExpressing frustration over the seizures, Mr Geisel said that despite the crisis, the \"methods of the Wild West\" should not prevail, and called on the German government \"to press the US to stick to international rules.\"\n\nThe mayor of Berlin, Michael M\u00fcller, accused Mr Trump of \"lacking solidarity\" and behaving \"irresponsibly\".\n\nAccording to Tagesspiegel the Berlin police had ordered the masks from 3M. They were produced in a 3M factory in China and were due to be reloaded at Bangkok airport and flown to Germany. Instead the delivery went straight to the US.\n\nGermany has imposed an export ban on protective clothing, particularly OP and FFP masks, as it fights coronavirus within its borders.\n\nFrench politicians have also complained of American attempts to divert shipments of masks intended for France to the US, although the US embassy in Paris denied on Friday that Washington was responsible.\n\nFrance itself was accused last month of commandeering orders of medical equipment ordered by buyers in neighbouring countries.\n\nThe Trump administration has not enacted export controls to keep products in the US. However, Peter Navarro, a White House trade and manufacturing adviser, hinted on Thursday at a forthcoming executive order that would see the US customs agency block foreign sales of medical supplies with inflated prices.\n\n\"We are going to crack down unmercifully,\" Mr Navarro said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

EU to help counter the coronavirus crisis, in a move that is likely to anger China and highlights the geopolitical dimension of the pandemic.\n\nDiscussions are at an advanced stage for a donated cargo likely to exceed the 2.2m masks Beijing pledged to Brussels in March, officials briefed on the matter said.\n\n\"We have been in talks, and there is progress,\" said a senior government official in Taipei. \"There will be an announcement soon.\"\n\nChina, which claims Taiwan as its territory, demands third countries and international organisations ignore Taiwan's de facto independence and treat it as if it were ruled by Beijing. While the EU follows this so-called \"one China\" policy and has no diplomatic or formal political relations with Taiwan, it maintains a \"structured dialogue\" with Taipei -- and is scouring the world to source masks and other equipment as Covid-19 cases climb across Europe.\n\n\"We welcome solidarity,\" an EU official said of the Taiwan mask proposal, while acknowledging that \"Chinese sensitivities are obviously involved\".\n\nThe EU is still awaiting arrival of a consignment of 2m surgical masks, 200,000 N95 respiratory protection masks and 50,000 coronavirus testing kits from China announced on March 18 by Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president. The commission said on Tuesday that its latest information was that the supplies would be ready to send \"in the coming days\" to Italy, the European country most affected by coronavirus.\n\nThe planned Taiwanese mask offer is part of what media there brand \"epidemic prevention diplomacy\". Excluded from the World Health Organization at China's insistence, Taipei is keen to use its success so far in containing the virus to boost international co-operation, especially with 'like-minded countries' such as western democracies. As of Tuesday, Taiwan had only 322 confirmed coronavirus cases and a death toll of 5.\n\nAcademia Sinica, Taiwan's top scientific research institution, held a videoconference on the coronavirus crisis on March 18 with officials from various EU institutions. It said the two sides agreed to co-operate on development of a rapid diagnostic test and a vaccine.\n\nThe same day, Taiwan authorities signed a deal with the American Institute in Taiwan, the US quasi-embassy in Taipei, on anti-coronavirus co-operation. China blasted the agreement as \"a political plot to pursue independence with the help of the epidemic\".\n\nThe accord included a pledge that once Taiwan's mask production capacity had reached a level where it could spare some, it would provide 100,000 pieces a week to the US in exchange for materials for producing hazmat suits\n\nOn Monday, Taipei announced an arrangement with Australia, under which Canberra will provide alcohol needed for producing hand sanitiser in exchange for non-woven fabric from Taiwan for mask production.\n\nOne of Taipei's key measures to strengthen itself against the pandemic was an early export ban and rationing of domestic sales of medical masks, while the government offered incentives and procurement guarantees for manufacturers of the equipment. This has led to a rapid ramp-up of new mask production capacity, which had reached 13m pieces a day as of Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"},

popular during the coronavirus crisis, admitted that it had \"mistakenly\" routed some user data through China, marking the latest in a string of mis-steps to cast doubt on the security of the platform.\n\nThe Silicon Valley company -- which has been used by the British government, among others, to host meetings during the pandemic -- said late on Friday that certain meetings held by its non-Chinese users may have been \"allowed to connect to systems in China, where they should not have been able to connect\".\n\nThe company said it had \"mistakenly\" allowed the calls to flow through its two Chinese data centres since February as part of its efforts to cope with increased traffic, as millions of users flocked to use its technology to host business meetings and social catch-ups during lockdown.\n\nThe company said it had since fixed the flaw, adding that the error occurred only \"under extremely limited circumstances\" and that government customers were not affected.\n\nZoom has significant operations in China, including a research and development department with more than 700 staff, which it has cast as a bid to keep personnel costs low.\n\nUntil now it has sought to reassure western critics who have privacy concerns -- including that meetings may be vulnerable to spying from Beijing -- that their data was not routed through Chinese servers.\n\nOn Thursday the company had told the Financial Times that \"data originating in the US stays in the US, and cross-border meeting data goes to wherever the host's enterprise account is headquartered\". It also said at the time that it only had one data centre in China, not two.\n\nZoom floated in April last year and now has 200m daily active users, up from 10m at the end of year. Its shares have nearly doubled in 2020, although they are trading down 20 per cent a highs last week of $128.20.\n\nThe China revelations are the latest in a litany of concerns about the data security practices of the company, which on Thursday committed to shifting all its engineering resources to tackling privacy issues.\n\nMis-steps revealed in recent days include undisclosed data sharing, features that allowed users to harass other users, and misleading statements about its encryption capabilities -- all of which it has sought to address with technology or policy updates.\n\nIt also announced plans to prepare a transparency report about any data requests it has received from governments, following pressure from privacy advocacy groups.\n\nFriday's statement was prompted by new research from Citizen Lab, which found that in some cases, Zoom's encryption keys -- the code used to unscramble meetings data -- appeared to be being sent to servers in Beijing.\n\n\"A company primarily catering to North American clients that sometimes distributes encryption keys through servers in China is potentially concerning, given that Zoom may be legally obligated to disclose these keys to authorities in China,\" Citizen Lab said.\n\nCitizen Lab said that the app was a \"high priority target\" for intelligence gathering and hacking by nation states, and warned that it should not be used by parties sharing sensitive information.\n\n\"An app with easily identifiable limitations in cryptography, security issues, and offshore servers located in China which handle meeting keys presents a clear target to reasonably well-resourced nation state attackers, including the People's Republic of China,\" the report said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

shocks, one thing is still guaranteed to make British ministers and officials bristle: mentioning the Germans. \"Arrgh,\" sighed one senior adviser, stung by unflattering comparisons.\n\nWith the pandemic bearing down, Boris Johnson on March 17 called on Britain's captains of industry to start building ventilators to supplement the country's stock of 8,000, lightheartedly dubbing the scheme \"Operation Last Gasp\".\n\nBut almost a week before the prime minister spoke, Germany had ordered 10,000 from an established manufacturer, adding to its existing 20,000 machines. This week Germany had more than twice as many critical care beds vacant -- around 15,000 to 20,000 -- as England has in its system overall.\n\nEven more stark is relative performance on testing. The UK and Germany entered the crisis in lock-step, working together on virus tests, some of the first developed in the world. But Germany's labs ran at more than five-times the NHS rate, completing 918,460 tests versus Britain's 163,194.\n\nOnly on Thursday did Matt Hancock, the health secretary, declare Britain would \"ramp up\" efforts by harnessing private facilities -- just as the global supply of chemicals and testing equipment was being squeezed. \"Germany had 100 test labs at the start, largely thanks to Roche, but we had to start from a lower base,\" he said. \"We are going to build a British diagnostics industry at scale.\"\n\nExperts say it is too early to judge how different policy choices have affected countries during this global pandemic. Germany's advantages stem from decades of higher health spending, alongside an industrial base better able to scale-up for an emergency. Even with this head-start, German ministers admit they are in \"the calm before the storm\"; in terms of deaths, the country is on a similar coronavirus trajectory to the UK.\n\nBut Berlin's strategy has nevertheless held up an unforgiving mirror to Britain's government. This is not just with regard to NHS capacity -- tuned more for resource efficiency than resilience -- but the quality and pace of decision making. The charge: that Britain's strategy twisted and turned, squandering precious time.\n\n\"It just wasn't consistent. They tested various strategies and rejected them,\" said Martin Stuermer, a virologist at IMD Labor in Frankfurt. \"They had this plan to allow life to go on but ensure that elderly people were protected. But then they abandoned that. And they weren't prepared for mass testing. but the main problem was that the government just didn't chart a clear course in this crisis -- unlike the German government.\"\n\nThe implications may soon become terrifyingly clear. UK infections are expected to peak by Easter Sunday.\n\nMr Johnson was slow to grip the coronavirus crisis. Evidence coming out of China about the disease in February was deemed unreliable and there was a hope it would burn itself out, like Sars in 2003.\n\nAlthough Whitehall had started working up contingency plans from the start of 2020, the lack of urgency was summed up by Mr Johnson's decision to disappear for a week in late February to his grace-and-favour Chevening home. It was only on March 2 that he chaired his first coronavirus emergency meeting.\n\nAt this point advisers were envisaging a spread of the virus through Britain -- controlled by escalating social distancing measures -- with a peak around mid-May to early-June. \"Glastonbury should be all right,\" one minister told anxious colleagues, referring to the world's biggest music festival in late June.\n\nRather than following countries like South Korea in taking immediate draconian action to stop the disease -- including the use of mass testing -- Mr Johnson's team thought a more modulated approach would ultimately save more lives and cause less economic harm.\n\nPatrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, found a willing ally in Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief adviser, in embracing the concept of \"herd immunity\", where the disease passed through healthy members of the population. Mr Cummings referred to the concept in a 2013 blog.\n\n\"There was an element of British exceptionalism to it,\" said one Treasury official.\n\nCrucially during this time, Public Health England, a government agency, also advised that mass-testing was not feasible. Neil Ferguson, a professor at Imperial College and government adviser, told parliament it was \"very clear from messages from PHE that we would have nowhere near enough testing capacity to adopt that strategy\".\n\nUnlike Germany's decentralised and at times unwieldy system, the UK chose to concentrate efforts in superlabs, in part to ensure reliability. Sharon Peacock of PHE said it was preferable to \"dissipating our efforts into a lot of laboratories\". One senior academic said PHE struggled to delegate one of its core functions; the service had been \"hanging around waiting for the next epidemic. That is what they are paid to do,\" he said.\n\nBut in practice it meant that while Germany broadened its testing strategy to cover all those with mild symptoms -- the core of a strategy to test, trace and isolate people infected with the virus -- by March, Britain was struggling to scale up. The approach was narrowed to testing only hospital admissions. Only 5,000 of approx 500,000 frontline NHS workers had been tested by Thursday.\n\nDonald Trump was to say later that if Britain had persisted with the herd immunity approach it would have been \"catastrophic\". But that had already become clear to Mr Johnson and his team by the weekend of March 14-15.\n\nNew data from Italy confirmed the disease was spreading faster than previously thought, with more patients ending up in intensive care units: Imperial College warned about 250,000 people would have died in the UK without a change of course. Worse still, ministers were advised that even if NHS intensive care capacity was doubled or trebled, it would be overwhelmed three times over.\n\nMr Hancock, Michael Gove, cabinet office minister, and Mr Cummings now urged Mr Johnson to put aside his libertarian instincts and effectively lock down Britain. \"The three of them saw it immediately,\" said one Number 10 official. Another official involved in the strategy change said: \"When the facts change, you change your mind.\"\n\nRestrictions on social life lagged some of Germany's states by a week or so, but the differences with Britain were less pronounced than with some other countries.\n\nMore consequential for Britain was the gaping flaw the strategy-change exposed in Britain's preparations. The only exit strategies from the lockdown appeared to be a vaccine or antiviral treatments -- still thought to be many months away -- or mass community testing to allow restrictions to be eased without triggering a second wave.\n\n\"If you follow a herd immunity strategy, why would you not build treatment and testing capacity? That's what puzzles me,\" asked Devi Sridhar, professor of global health at Edinburgh University. \"I think it is because they were taking everything from the flu playbook. In flu you don't have to chase every case down, you don't test in the community or medical staff\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009But coronavirus is not flu.\"\n\nTo expand treatment, Britain has already doubled its critical care bed capacity this month and aims to acquire up to 50,000 ventilators in total. Some 30 are due to arrive this weekend but 8,000 are expected in the next few weeks. But time is very short. Since the beginning of the outbreak Germany has amassed 10,000.\n\nMr Johnson appealed to household names such as Airbus, Nissan, Dyson and McClaren to aid the effort. But some established medical equipment makers felt left in the cold. \"They've overlooked the real manufacturers in the system,\" said one person at a medical devices maker who asked not to be named. Ministers insist they have pursued all avenues, engaging with industry since February.\n\nBlame over testing mis-steps is being directed by ministers at the NHS bureaucracy and PHE. \"They're proud of their independence and won't yield for anyone,\" said one minister of health officials. \"The same is true for Public Health England: they're the reason we don't have more testing. They want to control the whole tedious process.\"\n\nFor doctors a long way downstream from the decisions in Whitehall, the impression has overwhelmingly been one of dithering and delay caused by theoreticians being left to manage an emergency.\n\n\"To us on the frontline, it feels like this is what happens when you let epidemiologists in charge of the real world,\" said an NHS Consultant from Hertfordshire on the Covid frontline. \"What has never been explained to those working in respiratory care is why there wasn't 'test, test, test', then isolate, contact and trace again, which is the absolute basis of public health and infection control. Now they seem to have reacted, but it's all too late.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

is currently 4.7 per cent. That is the proportion of people, as of Sunday afternoon, who have died after being diagnosed with the virus -- 32,137 out of the 685,623 who have tested positive for Covid-19 around the world.\n\nIt compares with a death rate of around 0.1 per cent for seasonal flu and 0.2 per cent for pneumonia in high-income countries. However, 4.7 per cent is not only changeable but frustratingly unreliable, both for governments seeking to calibrate their policy response and for citizens trying to gauge how much they should worry.\n\nThe proportion of people who have died from the disease varies strikingly from country to country. Researchers warn that there are so many uncertainties -- not least over the true number of infections -- that it remains almost impossible to draw firm conclusions about the death rate.\n\nMike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organisation's health emergencies programme, has outlined four factors that might contribute to the differing mortality rates: who becomes infected, what stage the epidemic has reached in a country, how much testing a country is doing, and how well different healthcare systems are coping.\n\nBut there are other sources of doubt too, including how many coronavirus victims would have died of other causes if no pandemic had occurred. In a typical year, around 56m people die around the world -- an average of about 153,000 per day.\n\nInsufficient testing\n\nArguably the biggest unknown about Covid-19 is the true number of people worldwide who have contracted the virus. Without that information no accurate death rate can be calculated.\n\nMany infected people will display either mild or no symptoms, and will remain absent from the data unless they are tested. Since resources are limited and different countries are testing to different extents, the size of the information gap varies from place to place.\n\nJohn Ioannidis, a professor of epidemiology at Stanford University, has branded the data we have about the epidemic \"utterly unreliable\".\n\n\"We don't know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300,\" he wrote last week. If thousands more people are surviving than we know about, then current mortality rate estimates are too high -- perhaps by a large margin.\n\nResearchers at the University of Hong Kong have estimated that, in Wuhan, where the pandemic began, the likely death rate was 1.4 per cent -- much lower than the previous estimate of 4.5 per cent, which was calculated using official statistics on the region's cases and deaths.\n\nIn the UK, where the government has been criticised for a slow initial response, only the most serious cases are being tested. In total 1,231 people have died out of 19,758 confirmed cases, giving a death rate of 6.2 per cent.\n\nRosalind Smyth, professor of child health at UCL, said official UK coronavirus data was \"so misleading that it should not be used\". Using conservative estimates, the true number of people infected \"is likely to be 5-10 times higher\", she said.\n\nThe age of people infected\n\nMuch depends on who gets infected, how old they are and whether they have underlying health conditions. It is well known that those who are older are more likely to become seriously ill and die. But Robin May, professor of infectious diseases at Birmingham University, notes: \"There are 70-year-olds who are wheelchair bound and others who run miles every week.\"\n\nThe WHO has also warned that younger people are \"not invincible\" and must take the virus seriously.\n\nItaly has to date been the worst affected country in Europe, with 10,023 deaths and 92,472 infections, giving a crude mortality rate of 10.8 per cent. But the average age of Italians who have tested positive is 62, and the vast majority of those who have died have been 60 or over.\n\n\"Italy has been a poster child for healthy people living into old age,\" said Dr Ryan. \"Unfortunately, in this case, having that older population may mean that the fatality rate appears higher because of the actual age distribution of the population.\"\n\nBut different countries are also reporting cases and deaths in different ways: in Italy, Covid-19 is listed as the cause of death even if a patient was already ill and died from a combination of illnesses.\n\n\"Only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus,\" said the scientific adviser to Italy's minister of health last week.\n\nSpain's national government simply lists how many people with confirmed cases of coronavirus have died and provides no extra information on any other medical conditions.\n\nIn South Korea, which has a younger population than Italy, around a third of confirmed cases were in people aged 30 or under: 152 people have died so far out of 9,583 infections, giving a mortality rate of 1.6 per cent. In Germany, which has recorded 455 deaths, the majority of infections have occurred in people aged 15 to 59. Based on the available data, the country's death rate is around 0.8 per cent, but this may also reflect its aggressive approach to testing people with milder symptoms.\n\nRisk of death from other causes\n\nIn the UK, around 150,000 people die every year between January and March. To date, the vast majority of those who have died from Covid-19 in Britain have been aged 70 or older or had serious pre-existing health conditions.\n\nWhat is not clear is how many of those deaths would have occurred anyway if the patients had not contracted Covid-19.\n\nSpeaking at a parliamentary hearing last week, Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said it was not yet clear how many \"excess deaths\" caused by coronavirus there would be in the UK. However, he said the proportion of Covid-19 victims who would have died anyway could be \"as many as half or two-thirds\".\n\nWhat stage of the outbreak preparations begin\n\nAt what stage in the epidemic cycle a country begins to prepare its healthcare system is crucial.\n\nIf a healthcare system becomes overwhelmed, as happened in Italy and parts of China, the standard of care that patients receive is likely to fall. This is likely to increase the mortality rate.\n\nIn one hospital in Lombardy, northern Italy, a chronic shortage of equipment means staff are now using snorkelling masks bought from Decathlon, a leisure goods chain, to hook up patients to oxygen supplies.\n\nGiven the number of patients in intensive care in the region, the WHO's Dr Ryan said last week, the fact that doctors are saving \"so many is a miracle in itself\".\n\nDr Clarke said it was \"not a given that [the UK and Germany] will end up in exactly the same place that Italy is in,\" because \"you can't draw any cast-iron conclusions from a trajectory on a graph\".\n\nBeing behind the curve gives countries longer to prepare for an outbreak and learn from others' mistakes.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType":

century may have pushed political rivalries to one side. Not so in Spain, one of the nations worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with over 100,000 confirmed cases and more than 9,000 dead.\n\nThe government's official slogan is \"United, we will stop this virus\". But, as the death toll mounts and Madrid uses emergency powers to issue economic diktats, the politics of confrontation has returned with a vengeance.\n\nThis week the principal opposition grouping, the centre-right People's party, labelled prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez a liar and one PP regional leader even accused the government of issuing orders to hide the real death count.\n\nThe far-right Vox -- the third biggest force in congress -- has called for Mr S\u00e1nchez's resignation and replacement by a government of national unity. Meanwhile, the pro-independence administration of Catalonia upbraids the government for its alleged incompetence and parsimony on an almost daily basis.\n\n\"Here, instead of closing ranks and looking for the maximum possible consensus, the politicians are opting for a bitter fight -- lucha dura,\" said Astrid Barrio, a politics professor at the University of Valencia. \"I am not sure citizens are going to appreciate that when the obvious priority is the health emergency.\"\n\nSome blame the tensions on the already significant levels of polarisation in a country where people turned to radical solutions in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and where far-left and Catalan nationalist votes helped bring Mr S\u00e1nchez to power, to the enduring disgust of the right.\n\nOthers fault the alleged mismanagement of his new Socialist-led coalition, which has barely been three months in office.\n\nWhile the country has united in applause for health workers at eight o'clock every evening, underlying tensions have been exposed at other times -- such as when different groups of Spaniards have banged pots and pans in protest at the government or, on one occasion, against the royal family.\n\nWhatever their cause, the deep fissures now re-emerging highlight the scale of the challenge if the country is to overcome the health crisis and the economic reckoning that many fear is to come.\n\nTo impose Spain's two and half week old lockdown, Mr S\u00e1nchez's minority coalition assumed sweeping emergency powers, and won the backing of opposition parties in parliament to do so.\n\nThe government says its steps are having an impact -- reducing the daily increase in confirmed cases in percentage terms and the numbers of new entrants to intensive care wards. It adds that it has authorised more than \u20ac4bn in funds to fight the virus, much of which has gone to Spain's regions.\n\nBut even as they voted through the emergency powers, and their subsequent prolongation, Spain's rightwing opposition MPs voiced deep misgivings about Mr S\u00e1nchez and his allies' management of the crisis.\n\nNow those recriminations have taken centre stage as the death count regularly tops 800 a day and the government takes temporary measures, such as prohibiting businesses hit by the crisis from sacking employees and banning \"non-essential\" work while requiring companies still to pay salaries.\n\nPablo Casado, the leader of the PP, accuses Mr S\u00e1nchez of lying or hiding information, since the prime minister opposed a ban on non-essential work last week.\n\nSpain's biggest employers confederation has also inveighed against the government for that ban, which it says risks the \"massive destruction\" of jobs and businesses \"in a definitive manner\".\n\nNacho Torreblanca of the European Council on Foreign Relations faults Mr S\u00e1nchez for failing to follow up his calls for national unity with the appropriate level of consultation with business and other political parties.\n\n\"It is clear that, after a certain point, the government had to shut the country down,\" he said. \"But the manner in which S\u00e1nchez did it -- making the decision, then getting cabinet approval and then writing the decree -- that only increases the polarisation.\"\n\nThe government fiercely contests such arguments, noting calls in previous days for a tougher clampdown on economic activity from centre-right leaders in regions such as Madrid and Murcia, as well as the separatist administration in Catalonia.\n\n\"People would not understand why the PP, which has spent weeks asking for a tougher lockdown and a paralysis of industrial activity, will not support it at this time,\" said Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero, budget minister and government spokeswoman. The measure will have to be approved by parliament in the next month.\n\nWithin the government, one of the champions of an industrial shutdown was Pablo Iglesias, leader of the leftwing Podemos and deputy prime minister, who argued for such a measure for days, despite the reservations of the economics ministries.\n\nOn Sunday Mr Iglesias tweeted a reminder that according to the Spanish constitution, \"the country's entire wealth\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is subordinated to the general interest\". That led his critics to warn of nationalisations in the offing. Under Spain's current emergency rules, the government has the power to requisition or command private companies.\n\n\"You can see how this could be October 1917 in the eyes of Podemos, the moment they can make a fundamental change in how the economy works,\" says Mr Torreblanca.\n\nPodemos counters that there is a world of difference between learning from the inadequacies of the government response to the financial crisis a decade ago and turning Spain into a Venezuela on the Mediterranean.\n\n\"The era of neoliberal solutions, of austerity and putting the emphasis on bank bailouts is over,\" said a Podemos official. \"It is more important to save lives than to save businesses.\"\n\nAt a press appearance this week, Mr Iglesias said the coalition hoped soon to announce plans for a living minimum income. But he also acknowledged unspecified errors and said the government's duty was \"to reach out its hand to the opposition\" for constructive suggestions, adding: \"The citizens will judge the roles that everyone played.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type":

number of European countries making the wearing of face masks outside the home compulsory amid shifting debate over the medical gear's protective utility.\n\nAuthorities would start distributing millions of free face masks at the entrances to all supermarkets from midweek onwards, chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced on Monday. Shoppers will only be permitted inside supermarkets and other open stores, such as pharmacies, if they are wearing masks.\n\nWhile masks are a familiar sight throughout Asia, the only other countries in Europe to require the wearing of masks in public space are Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nThe step would be a \"learning phase\" for further measures to come that would mandate the use of masks for any situation outside the home likely to bring people close to one another, Mr Kurz said on Monday.\n\n\"I'm fully aware that wearing masks is something alien to our culture,\" he added. \"Together we have to do everything [possible] so that we can quickly return to normalcy and a functioning economy.\"\n\nThe move by Vienna comes as European governments devise ways to contain the spread of Covid-19 and keep it from re-emerging after their economies come out of their prolonged self-imposed lockdowns. It marks a departure from earlier official guidance.\n\nThe WHO and many governments say healthy people do not need to wear a mask unless they are taking care of a person with suspected Covid-19 infection. The advice is partly an attempt to stop people who don't need masks -- which are in short supply in many places and needed by health workers -- from trying to buy them.\n\nThe German government may enforce a similar obligation when it considers relaxing the lockdown measures, health ministry spokesman Hanno Kautz told reporters on Monday, according to Reuters. Such masks could help protect others from contracting the illness from the wearer, Mr Kautz was quoted as saying.\n\nFrance initially advised its citizens not to wear masks, then advised they should wear one only if they were infected or if they worked in care or retail. The main reason was that the government chose to keep its short supplies for hospitals.\n\nBut French trade unions representing shop assistants, factory workers and police officers have demanded safety equipment for all staff or else they would exercise their right to refuse to work in dangerous conditions.\n\nIn Italy, where the outbreak has been the deadliest in the world, the wearing has within a month gone from attracting disapproving looks to being socially obligatory.\n\nThe free masks delivered by the Austrian government will not meet the same medical standards as those used on the front line by doctors and nurses, but Vienna hopes that by forcing citizens to cover their noses and mouths in public, even if with simple barriers, will have a meaningful impact on transmission of the virus.\n\nAdvice from the Austrian government's medical advisers indicates the new coronavirus is likeliest to be spread through larger droplets ejected by coughing and sneezing -- which a rudimentary mask might impede -- rather than in smaller aerosol particles that the body sheds through breathing alone that could only be stopped by more sophisticated means. The Red Cross has issued guidance in Austria to citizens on how they can make their own masks at home.\n\n\"It would be a mistake to think that such masks protect you,\" Mr Kurz added. \"But the airborne transmission is somewhat reduced. This is not a substitute for [social] distancing.\"\n\nAustria's has been among the most aggressive governments in Europe in taking action to curb public life in order to stop the pandemic: the approach -- which has even included sequestering tourists in hotels in designated quarantine zones such as Tyrol -- has yielded Mr Kurz's government plaudits at home. It stands in contrast to the more laissez-faire approach adopted in the UK and Sweden.\n\nPolice in Austria have rigorously enforced stay-at-home rules and movement restrictions: according to the interior ministry, more than 10,426 cautions have been given.\n\nThe government has said it will not even consider the rollback of restrictions until the daily growth rate of new coronavirus cases falls below 1 per cent. As of Monday morning, Austria had recorded 8,813 confirmed Covid-19 cases -- with 108 deaths. The growth rate has decreased over the past two weeks, from roughly 40 per cent in mid-March, to 11 per cent.\n\n\"The truth is, it's a marathon and it's not our job to just say what you want to hear,\" Mr Kurz said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score":

hibernation. Governments that have imposed lockdowns to slow the spread of coronavirus are focused on how to help the millions who have been put out of work. But not everyone is hunkered down at home. Essential workers must go out to keep the lights on and their fellow citizens fed. This has exposed an uncomfortable truth: the people we need the most are often the ones we value the least.\n\nThe situation is particularly stark in the UK. Doctors and nurses have rightly received an outpouring of national gratitude, but they are not the only ones on the front line. The list of \"key workers\" also includes those who work in nurseries, care homes, food factories, warehouses and delivery drivers. These are some of the worst paid and most insecure jobs in the British economy.\n\nOfficial data suggests that more than 40 per cent of childcare workers aged 25 and over, who should be covered by the minimum wage, are paid below it. Almost 60 per cent of those who provide care for people in their own homes in England are on so-called \"zero-hour contracts\", which do not guarantee regular hours or incomes. Workers in fields and food factories often have to accept temporary employment contracts with fewer rights and no security. Many delivery drivers are classed as self-employed, so they are paid per \"drop\" and receive no sick or holiday pay.\n\nThis precarious army labours around the clock. On Monday I spoke to a domiciliary care worker who visits bed-bound clients in their homes (she did not want to be named for fear of punishment by her employer). She was in the middle of a 10-hour shift, having worked 14 hours on Saturday and 14 on Sunday. \"We're all putting the effort in,\" she said. She is paid \u00a39.75 an hour at weekends and \u00a38.75 in the week, which amounts to about \u00a31,700 a month.\n\nMeanwhile, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has promised to pay all non-essential furloughed employees 80 per cent of their salaries, or up to \u00a32,500 a month. That was the right thing to do to prevent mass unemployment. But it means the government is paying higher wages to some people to sit at home and do nothing than others who are being paid to do essential work -- and at personal risk to their own health. Social distancing is not possible for a careworker.\n\nUnison, the union for many care staff, has been raising concerns about the lack of personal protective equipment. The care worker I spoke to had gloves but no mask; she had purchased her own hand sanitiser. Her company, which employs her on a zero-hours contract, would only pay statutory sick pay of \u00a394.25 a week if she developed symptoms and had to self-isolate. \"Before, I would have gone into work with a cold or a cough -- now I'd have to stay off but then I don't know how I would pay the bills.\"\n\nOf course, it was always senseless for care staff to be disincentivised from staying away from often vulnerable clients when they were unwell. Coronavirus isn't the only bug that can be deadly to the old and frail. But the pandemic has forced us to acknowledge problems we have long found it easier to ignore.\n\nThere are things we can do. In the short-term, having splashed a lot of cash on the unemployed, the chancellor should pay a \"national gratitude bonus\" to every key worker who is risking his or her own health to keep the rest of us comfortable at home.\n\nOnce the economy has recovered, these jobs need to be made better. Insecure contracts and loopholes should be replaced with permanent jobs, better wages and more training and accreditation. This would not be costless. Admittedly, some companies in low-wage sectors such as food, care and logistics would simply make less profit.\n\nThe care worker I spoke to, for example, is convinced her employer could afford to pay staff more \"if you compare what the private clients pay to what we get\". But others have wafer-thin margins already, such as social care providers that have bid competitively for contracts from cash-strapped local authorities.\n\nIt is likely, then, that we would have to pay more for some things. Food would become more expensive; higher taxes would be required to fund social care and childcare; home delivery might no longer be free.\n\nSome will object that higher prices would push those on the breadline into deprivation. But the answer is not to keep these goods and services unfeasibly cheap, it is to use the tax and benefit system to make sure nobody is so close to poverty to begin with. A look at Scandinavia shows that a different balance between wages and prices is perfectly possible.\n\nCoronavirus has forced us to rethink who we value and how. Some of the workers we have left to languish in low-paid and insecure jobs are the very ones we cannot live without. It's not just time to be grateful. It's time to make amends.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-hour_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zero-hour contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preschool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temporary work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_sick_pay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statutory sick pay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accreditation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accreditation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loophole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loophole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Home_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Home Health", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Home_Health/Home_Care", "label": "dmoz/Health/Home Health/Home Care", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fceef8808-7414-11ea-90ce-5fb6c07a27f2?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 2200}, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 2200, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6020680716", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-05", "time": "06:03:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-05T06:03:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-05T06:02:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.9333333373069763, "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/9c75d47f-49ee-4613-add1-a692b97d95d3", "title": "Fewer deaths in Veneto offer clues for fight against coronavirus", "body": "When at the end of February Lombardy and Veneto recorded Italy's first local cases of transmission of coronavirus, the two regions quickly erected road blocks, establishing Europe's first lockdown and a precedent for the rest of the continent.\n\nSince then the fortunes of the two wealthy neighbours, which have some of the best-resourced health systems in Europe, have tragically diverged.\n\nStruck by a human catastrophe unseen in Europe outside of war, with military trucks taking away corpses from the city of Bergamo, Lombardy has a death rate of 17 per cent.\n\nBut Veneto's is just over 5 per cent. While virologists caution that the percentage death rate is closely tied to the level of testing, they also attribute the gap to other factors, such as Veneto's reluctance to hospitalise compared with its neighbour.\n\n\"Veneto has a very low mortality compared to the rest of Italy,\" said Professor Andrea Crisanti, a leading virologist from the University of Padua, in charge of a mass testing programme across Veneto. \"This shows that our approach has worked well so far.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday Lombardy, which has a population of 10m people, accounts for 7,593, or 57.7 per cent, of Italy's total declared deaths from the virus of 13,155. Meanwhile Veneto, which has a population of 4.9m, has suffered 499 official deaths out of 9,625 diagnosed cases.\n\nHigher levels of testing and tracing in Veneto is the most widely cited explanation for why the region has managed to control its outbreak more effectively than its neighbours.\n\nLuca Zaia, governor of Veneto, was the first regional head in Italy to devise a widespread testing programme that involves drive-through swabs done in cars as well as tests in medical centres.\n\nThey acted in direct contradiction of World Health Organization guidance, which advises only to test the sick. On the advice of the region's own scientists, Veneto has to date conducted 112,746 tests as of Wednesday, the second-highest in Italy after the 121,449 of Lombardy in spite of having half of its population.\n\nYet experts say testing is not the only reason for the lower death rate.\n\nVenetian doctors also cite the region's expertise in infectious disease, something they trace back to its pioneering history dealing with viruses arriving in its port from the east. The word quarantine derives from quarantena, the Venetian word for \"forty days\", or the amount of time ships arriving from plague-ridden destinations were isolated.\n\nFor Giorgio Pal\u00f9, one of Europe's leading virologists, and scientific adviser to the governor of Veneto, a critical factor has been the number of diagnosed patients taken into hospital.\n\nProfessor Pal\u00f9 said the hospitalisation rate in Lombardy, meaning the number of diagnosed patients who are taken in for clinical treatment, at the start of the outbreak was about 65 per cent.\n\nThis compares with 20 per cent in Veneto, where the majority were told to stay at home unless urgent care was required.\n\n\"There were different instructions given to the sick by the different regional health authorities,\" he said. \"Yes, there has been more testing in Veneto but people were kept at home and not taken into hospitals. The more patients you admit to the hospital, the more cases you get. You create the outbreak as at the start nobody was taking care of sampling the doctors or nurses, [so] you were taking home the infection.\"\n\nHis observation comes as more than 60 Italian doctors and health workers have died, the majority of these in Lombardy. A group of doctors from the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo warned last month that hospitals had become the main source of transmission of Covid 19 infections, and urged more patients to be treated at home.\n\n\"We are learning that hospitals might be the main Covid-19 carriers,\" they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"They are rapidly populated by infected patients, facilitating transmission to uninfected patients.\"\n\nThe Veneto region has a large network of smaller health centres, which have been used to diagnose and treat patients in ways that have kept them out of large hospitals, said Professor Pal\u00f9.\n\nThe fact that Lombardy has a greater proportion of private hospitals than Veneto also contributed to more Covid-19 patients ending up in hospitals, he argued. The Lombardy administration was also under political pressure, he added.\n\n\"In Lombardy there were too many admissions from the primary side, where the triage was done. The Italian prime minister at the start criticised the hospitals in Lombardy, and it seems they responded by wanting to show they were treating people, not telling them to stay at home.\"\n\nOfficials in Lombardy also said Rome should have done more. \"I put my mask on on the television, and they insulted me and told me that I undermined Italy's credibility,\" said Lombardy's governor Attilio Fontana this week. \"Perhaps I should have been tougher in opposing the [central] government.\" Late last month, Lombardy established teams of medics to monitor at home patients who had been discharged from hospital.\n\nFor now, the mood in both regions is sombre.\n\n\"Have we committed errors? Of course we have,\" said Giulio Gallera, Lombardy's head of welfare last week. \"We have always given our best to offer the many people who arrived in our hospitals the necessary care\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we have done the best we could.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This pandemic may not itself transform the world, but it can accelerate changes already under way. One ongoing change has been in the relationship between China, the rising superpower, and the US, the incumbent. Being a superpower is not just about brute strength, it is also about being seen as a competent and decent leader. After victories in the second world war and the cold war, the US was such a leader. Despite rising economic strength, China is not. But times can change. The coronavirus may accelerate the process.\n\nKishore Mahbubani, a former Singaporean diplomat, has written a characteristically provocative book on the struggle for primacy between the two superpowers under the provocative title Has China Won? The answer, he suggests, is not yet. But it might. This is not just because of its scale, but also because of American mistakes, including false perceptions of Chinese reality. Perhaps the most important conclusion to draw from his analysis is that global influence derives mainly from one's own choices. China and the US have each made big mistakes. But the US failure to create widely shared prosperity at home, and its bellicosity abroad, are proving crippling. The dismal presidency of a malevolent incompetent is one result.\n\nNow has come the virus, an event not considered in this book. It casts a harsh light on the competence and decency of the superpowers. It has done the same on EU solidarity (or its absence), the effectiveness of states, the vulnerability of finance and the capacity for global co-operation. In all this, the performance of the US and China is of pre-eminent importance. So what have we learnt?\n\nThe novel coronavirus, which is causing such social and economic havoc, emerged in China's Hubei province. There seems little doubt about this. The US National Institutes of Health state that it originated in bats. Irresponsibly and tragically, the local authorities suppressed news of the infection, causing a delay of at least three weeks in the response. That let the virus spread across the world. Thereafter, however, the Chinese state took brutal action, bringing the disease under control in Hubei and halting its spread across China. Relative to population, China's mortality rate has been very low. Both the initial suppression of bad news and the scale of the response are characteristics of a repressive, yet effective, state. (See charts.)\n\nEffective response to the disease will have had a big economic cost in China. But the state encouraged employers to retain their employees, while also providing support to enterprises to do so. The official urban unemployment rate has risen very little. The largest group of victims has, as usual, been migrant labour. China can now reopen the economy, though there is a risk of a second wave of the disease as it does so.\n\nThe US has had its own forms of denial, emanating shamefully from President Donald Trump himself, together with huge failures in ramping up testing and providing equipment, as has the UK. Columbia University's Jeffrey Sachs has written devastatingly of the ill will and ineffectiveness on display. Infections are spreading at fearful speed across the country. It could get worse. Italy and Spain show how much worse. Yet the US has the additional drawback of a defective health system.\n\nThe US, like other high-income countries, has now responded with \"social distancing\", although Mr Trump has only reluctantly extended it, and a fiscal response, worth $2tn. Roman Frydman of New York University, argues that this is neither big enough, given the scale of the American economy, nor well-focused: only a 20th of this sum is going to hospitals, while state and local governments are short-changed. Worst of all, argues veteran anti-corruption campaigner, Frank Vogl, is a $500bn fund for big corporations likely to be under Mr Trump's unsupervised control, which is contrary to the will of Congress.\n\nThe fundamental American principles of democracy and individual freedom remain attractive to many around the world, despite the global rise of populist autocracy. The vigour of its private economy may yet save us all. But today the US is losing its reputation for elementary competence, already badly battered by its long list of futile wars and the financial crisis of 2007-09. Parts of government, notably the Federal Reserve, remain effective for now, though who knows what would happen in a second Trump term? But the fundamental capability of the often despised \"administrative state\" -- the bulwark of any complex urban civilisation -- really matters. At these times of crisis, its absence is lethal. A government at war with science and its own machinery is now very visible to all.\n\nFor those of us who believe in liberal democracy, these US failures hurt: they give credence to the idea that autocracy works better. But the death of decency and competence in core western governments matters beyond even this. The arrival of the pandemic is a global moral challenge. It is necessary to tackle the spread of disease, manage financial shocks, stabilise the economy and help the weak. The US has to play a big part. There remains no alternative to its role.\n\nWe have been reminded that no man is an island in a pandemic. As Gordon Brown argues: \"Out of this crisis must come reforms to the international architecture and a whole new level of global co-operation.\" If this is to happen, some states must lead. Any global order rests on co-operation among powerful states. China and the US must not only function. They must function together, recognising the many interests they share, while tolerating their deep differences.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"},

India did not get the next 21 days right it would risk wiping out the gains of 21 years. In South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa ordered one of the world's strictest lockdowns before the country had registered even a single coronavirus death. The three-week shutdown was necessary, the president said, to save hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nAll across the developing world -- with some exceptions, including Brazil -- leaders are closing their economies to stop the pandemic. But in countries with high death rates from other illnesses and with brutal levels of poverty, could the cure actually be worse than the disease?\n\nIn an era of groupthink, in which not to impose a lockdown risks accusations of mass killing, it is at least worth posing the question. Even if leaders such as Mr Modi or Mr Ramaphosa hold private doubts, their instincts for political survival might force them onward. No one is likely to lose support for being too tough on coronavirus.\n\nTo state the obvious, it is harder to impose a lockdown in a poor country than in a rich one. In huge cities such as Lagos, Mumbai or Manilla, instructing people to stay at home is to confine millions to cramped housing. In the slums where up to half the population may live, people could be crammed six or eight to a room, with no easy access to water, or even soap.\n\nArundhati Roy, the Indian author and political activist, has called the lockdown not an act of social distancing but rather one of \"social compression\".\n\nIt is hard enough to keep wealthy economies ticking over in a lockdown. In poor countries, huge informal economies are a double-edged sword. They may act as shock absorbers. Some people might be able to leave the city and scrape a living on family plots of land. In other ways, informal economies make things more difficult.\n\nPeople who eke out an income by hawking roadside goods, fixing pots and pans, shining shoes or braiding tourists' hair have little way of surviving if they are forced indoors. Within hours of India's lockdown order, there were pitiable scenes of migrant workers trudging home by foot, in some cases hundreds of miles. In South Africa, too, signs of social stress are everywhere. Police have used rubber bullets and tear gas to enforce social distancing in the crowded townships, where the black majority still lives a quarter of a century after the end of apartheid.\n\nThen there are the silent bombs, the invisible consequences of fighting one disease to the possible neglect of others. While we obsessively count the coronavirus death toll, only a dedicated few worry about possible knock-on effects in a country such as the Democratic Republic of Congo where measles killed 6,200 and malaria 17,000 last year. If economies crash, silent killers such as diarrhoea, malnutrition and infant mortality may sweep through populations.\n\nAlex de Waal, executive director of the World Peace Foundation, says lockdowns are only effective if countries can bolster health systems and testing capacity. They cannot work without people's consent, which means income support and functioning supply chains.\n\nNone of this is to say that leaders such as Mr Modi or Mr Ramaphosa are wrong to impose lockdowns. These are truly agonising decisions made at times of radical uncertainty. There is little way of knowing whether populations are less at risk because they are young or more at risk because they may be malnourished or have compromised immunity.\n\nLast year, according to the UN's cheerfully named World Mortality Data Booklet, 9.9m people died in India and 10.4m in Africa. We will only know next year whether this number goes up in 2020. Even then, when it is too late, it might still be hard to draw sensible conclusions.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

according to Financial Times analysis.\n\nFor most of March, Italy and Spain have been in the eye of the storm, with each day bringing more new infections and deaths as their outbreaks accelerated. Following weeks of stringent lockdowns, however, there are early signs that both countries have turned a corner in their fight against the virus.\n\nItaly's new daily positive tests peaked at 6,557 on March 21 but have been trending steadily downwards since then. Deaths also appear to have peaked with 919 fatalities on March 27.\n\nSome experts have warned that Italy's falling case count may be because of a decline in daily testing numbers rather than a slowdown in the outbreak itself, but other data from the Italian health ministry show that hospitalisations are also declining, suggesting that the worst may have passed.\n\nA flattening and reduction in new cases and deaths still means that each day brings more infections and fatalities. In China, it took two months for daily infections to come down from their peak of thousands per day to the dozens seen now.\n\nSpain's outbreak has lagged a few days behind Italy's but appears to be following the same trend. Daily new infections in Spain peaked at 8,271 on March 26, but appeared to have plateaued at about 8,000 every day since. Similarly, Spain's daily death toll appears to be stabilising, but reached a new peak of 932 on April 1, up from 913 two days earlier.\n\nFrance and Germany's outbreaks are also showing early signs that exponential increases in cases are coming to an end. Daily death tolls in both are still accelerating, but daily new infections are beginning to stabilise.\n\nSweden is a cautionary tale. Daily new infections looked to have flattened off after peaking in mid March, but the rate of increase has begun picking up again.\n\nThe UK and the US outbreaks, by contrast, have shown no signs of slowing down. The UK locked down later than much of Europe, while the US has not yet applied national containment measures.\n\nIn the UK, April 1 brought more than 4,000 new confirmed cases, a thousand higher than on any previous day.

It really doesn't feel like they are sharing the pain,\" he added.\n\nOne insurer has introduced a blanket exclusion for any loss relating directly or indirectly to a communicable disease. Another has tightened the rules about \"denial of access\" cover -- which applies when a policyholder cannot access their business premises -- to exclude diseases.\n\n\"We are seeing the removal of any ambiguity,\" said Alex Balcombe, a partner at claims consultant Harris Balcombe. \"Brokers say it is happening across the board.\"\n\nThe changes come at a crucial time for many customers. Many insurance policies come up for renewal on April 1, and insurers have been making late changes to the terms they are prepared to offer on a range of commercial policies.\n\n\"It seems like a pretty bleak day for the industry,\" said Mr Hepburn. \"They don't have to take this stance. They could take a premium for it and provide the cover.\"\n\nOne City insurance broker said the trend was widespread across the industry, both at the Lloyd's of London insurance market and elsewhere. He said the new exclusions had partly been prompted by requests for information from rating agencies and regulators about how big the industry's exposure to coronavirus-related claims could be.\n\nMr Hepburn added that the rush to introduce new wording suggested there were \"probably a lot of grey areas\" in existing contracts. \"The insurers are probably concerned that they'll have to take a conciliatory approach to some of the claims that are coming through.\"\n\nInsurers say the pandemic will cost them as much as a large natural catastrophe, with claims against many types of policies. But they also say pandemics have been excluded from standard business interruption cover for many years, and that there has been little interest in policies that specifically cover this kind of event.\n\nIn a letter to parliament last week, Association of British Insurers director-general Huw Evans said providing more coverage for future outbreaks \"would require significant state

lockdowns imposed across much of the continent to contain the coronavirus pandemic, even if restrictions that have paralysed the economy are expected to remain in force for several more weeks.\n\nFrance, Spain, Belgium and Finland are among many countries that have set up expert committees to examine a gradual easing of stay-at-home orders for some businesses and schools while avoiding a second wave of infections that could overwhelm health services.\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez, the Spanish prime minister, on Saturday extended the shutdown of his country for another two weeks until April 26 but he said a ban imposed last month on all non-essential work including manufacturing and construction would be lifted after Easter.\n\n\"When we have the [infection] curve under control, we will shift towards a new normality and towards the reconstruction of our economy,\" Mr S\u00e1nchez added. \"A specific team of epidemiologists has been working for two weeks now on a plan to restart economic and social activity.\"\n\nAngelo Borrelli, head of Italy's Civil Protection Agency which is in charge of co-ordinating the national response to the outbreak, suggested a \"phase two\" of the country's lockdown could begin next month.\n\n\"I don't want to give dates, but between now and May 16 we may have further positive data that suggests we can resume activities and then start phase two,\" he said.\n\n\u00c9douard Philippe, the French premier, said last week that the process of \"deconfinement\" had no precedent and would be \"fearsomely complex\", adding: \"We are probably not heading for a deconfinement that would be absolute everywhere for everyone.\"\n\nDenmark, which was one of the first countries in Europe to shut down activity and close its borders, last week became the first to put a timetable on the loosening of restrictions.\n\n\"If we Danes for the next two weeks -- beyond Easter -- continue to stand together, at a distance, and if the numbers remain stable and reasonable, then the government will begin a gradual, quiet and controlled opening of our society again,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on March 30.\n\nFew other governments are willing to put a timescale on the loosening of restrictions not least because, according to most experts, it will require a massive increase in testing capacity. Many also worry about undermining the stay-at-home message with the onset of the Easter holidays and warmer weather and with populations already chafing at weeks of confinement and the loss of earnings.\n\nGermany, where the daily rate of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths has risen in recent days, has also begun preparing what one official called a \"phase-out\" that would be \"acceptable in terms of health policy\". \"But we've been careful about what we say in public,\" he added.\n\n\"The important message now is: we are not in a phase of the pandemic where we can tell people the measures can now be relaxed,\" Steffen Seibert, spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel, said on Friday. \"Of course you can prepare for that mentally, but for the moment it's this [stay-at-home] message that matters.\"\n\nHowever, some experts believe it is a big mistake for governments not to engage the public in a debate about loosening restrictions.\n\n\"Although it is clear we cannot talk about when the opening up will take place, we can talk about how,\" said Christiane Woopen, professor at the University of Cologne's Centre for Ethics, Rights, Economics, and Social Sciences of Health and a scientific adviser to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous region.\n\n\"The public deserve it. They are taking a lot of hardship. They have to trust what political leaders are doing in the next months.\"\n\nProf Woopen is one of a dozen academics -- epidemiologists, physicians, lawyers and economists -- who published a report on Friday for the Munich-based Ifo economics institute. The report is an attempt to frame what Prof Woopen calls an \"opening strategy, not an exit strategy\", since there is unlikely to be any return to normality before a reliable vaccine against Covid-19 becomes widely available, which appears several months away.\n\nA separate Ifo study predicted the German economy could shrink by up to 20 per cent this year if the shutdown lasted three months and was followed by only a gradual recovery. Prof Woopen and her fellow authors said social and psychological strain was as important to alleviate as the loss of output.\n\nThe Ifo report argues for a \"risk-adjusted\" strategy whereby some age groups, regions and social and business functions can resume activity before others. Schools could begin lessons, given the lower risk of severe symptoms in children and the burden of closure on working parents, but older people and high-risk groups may remain cloistered for months. Highly automated factories could start up but nightclubs would be at the back of the queue.\n\nThese changes will require huge shifts in organisation. Denmark and Belgium, for example, are considering splitting classes and the school week in two, to allow for better social distancing.\n\nAny loosening of restrictions would have to be accompanied by a ramping up of testing, said Martin Lohse, professor of pharmacology at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, and another of the Ifo report's authors.\n\nEven Germany's extensive testing -- it was conducting 50,000 a day last week -- is insufficient given its population of 80m, he said. Antibody testing would also be indispensable even if none of the tests being trialled around the world was so far deemed accurate enough. And governments needed to boost production of protective equipment as the wearing of face masks becomes more widespread. France for example is now considering making face masks mandatory in public.\n\nMore rigorous contact tracing and tracking via mobile phone apps, would also be essential, Prof Lohse added.\n\nA differentiated loosening of restrictions would inevitably be more confusing for the public than the stay-at-home instruction, Prof Lohse admitted. \"Transparent communications helps. Telling people the truth about difficult choices but also the hopes makes a real difference.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

hope in the race to fight coronavirus, with Johnson & Johnson announcing a potential vaccine that could be available early next year and Abbott Laboratories launching a rapid test.\n\nJohnson & Johnson said it had discovered a potential vaccine candidate and was teaming up with the US government to invest $1bn in its development, expecting to start testing in humans by September. Shares in the world's largest healthcare company rose 5.8 per cent to $130.17.\n\nAbbott is launching a test that can take as little as five minutes and can be run on a portable machine the size of a toaster. Shares in Abbott jumped 8.7 per cent to $81.07.\n\nUS politicians have worried that pharmaceutical companies could profit off the crisis while making vaccines and drugs unaffordable for many. But J&J promised on Monday that the vaccine would be sold on a \"not-for-profit\" basis during the pandemic.\n\nAlex Gorsky, chairman and chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, said the company feels a \"deep responsibility\" to improve the health of people around the world, using its scientific expertise, scale and financial strength.\n\n\"The world is facing an urgent public health crisis and we are committed to doing our part to make a Covid-19 vaccine available and affordable globally as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\nTroubles with tests have been blamed for a sluggish response to the outbreak in many countries. Abbott's new diagnostic test for Covid-19 could cut the wait for results down to as little as five minutes for a positive result and 13 minutes for a negative one.\n\nThe test runs on the company's portable platform, which is the most widely available point-of-care molecular testing device in the US. The test will start to be distributed to healthcare providers, such as doctor's offices, urgent care clinics and emergency departments, this week.\n\nRobert B. Ford, president of Abbott, said the device would help clinicians test \"outside of the traditional walls of a hospital in outbreak hotspots\".\n\nJ&J has been hunting for a vaccine candidate for Covid-19 since January. If the early trials go well, the company said the vaccine could be available by early 2021 to be used under an emergency use authorisation, a fast-track waiver from the US regulator.\n\nAs well as the expansion of its partnership with the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as Barda, on research and development, J&J is investing to rapidly scale its manufacturing capabilities, preparing to produce a billion doses by the end of 2021.\n\nBut while J&J has landed on a vaccine candidate far more quickly than usual, it is still behind Boston-based biotech Moderna. Moderna's candidate was ready more than a month ago and entered human testing in March, six months earlier than J&J plans for its potential vaccine.\n\nThe announcements came as three top scientific institutions received new funding to embark on trials to test whether existing drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can be used to prevent coronavirus infections, in the first investments made by the Covid-19 therapeutics accelerator, funded by the Wellcome Trust, the Gates Foundation and Mastercard.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [],

television broadcast last Tuesday night, I was hit by a wave of anxiety. The Indian premier, whose rare primetime appearances typically herald big announcements, had already addressed the nation days before to warn of the coronavirus threat. Then, he had called for a symbolic one-day \"people's curfew\" to show India's resolve to fight the outbreak. His reappearance so soon suggested something bigger in store.\n\nSure enough, Mr Modi had alarming news. Just a week earlier, India's top health officials were insisting the outbreak was under control, and that only travellers back from overseas or their contacts were infected. But now, he said, the deadly disease threatened to \"spread like wildfire\". He imposed a strict, nationwide, 21-day curfew.\n\nEven as he spoke, large swaths of India, including its main cities, were under different state-level lockdowns, due to last until March 31. Public transport services were suspended. But Mr Modi's stern televised admonition to India's 1.4bn people to stay indoors until mid-April or face criminal prosecution sparked panic.\n\nCurfew was starting in just four hours. Mr Modi promised authorities would ensure a smooth flow of essential items like milk, fresh fruits and vegetables to Indians' front doors so they need not step out at all. But plenty of city dwellers were sceptical. Minutes later, pharmacies and grocery shops were mobbed by panicked buyers stocking up on necessities.\n\nThough I did not join the scramble, I understood their fears. Like many, I will not forget the chaos unleashed when Mr Modi invalidated nearly 86 per cent of India's currency overnight back in 2016 in a dramatic bid to purge black money from the economy.\n\nThen, Mr Modi promised that those with legitimately earned cash could deposit it in their bank accounts or exchange it for the new currency. But little preparation had been done. New notes (slightly different size from the old ones) had not yet been printed in sufficient supply. ATM machines had to be recalibrated to dispense them.\n\nIndia's cash-dependent economy seized up, leading to widespread job losses. Millions of Indians, many of whom lacked bank accounts, waited hours, if not days, to exchange or access their own money, even in emergencies.\n\nMr Modi's coronavirus lockdown has displayed the same lack of preparedness. The wealthy elite and urban middle classes were advised to rely on ecommerce companies and neighbourhood shops to bring provisions to their doors. But no one told the police, who sought to enforce the national \"stay-at-home\" order by beating couriers making deliveries and shutting logistics warehouses, forcing a temporary suspension of ecommerce operations.\n\nAt my local vegetable shop, the manager was initially distraught, as their truckloads of fresh produce were barred from entering the city for days. The flow of food is now improving.\n\nBut these challenges pale when compared with the tribulations of vulnerable urban workers, including casual labourers, dependent on daily wages to feed themselves, and informal sector workers, easily dismissed in hard times.\n\nImposing the curfew, Mr Modi did not utter a word about how these millions of workers -- mainly rural migrants -- were to get by for three weeks without any earnings. Many turned to the only social safety net they have: the sanctuary of home. With public transport suspended, thousands began long, dangerous treks on foot back to their villages, in a mass exodus. But amid widespread fear of coronavirus, returnees cannot count on a warm welcome: at least one group of migrants was sprayed en masse with disinfecting bleach at a police check post.\n\nAt the weekend, Mr Modi apologised for the hardships the poor have suffered as a result of the lockdown, though he insists he had no choice. Yet for political ends, the prime minister often touts his own humble origins as the son of a railway station tea-seller, which he insists gives him insights into the lives of working-class voters.\n\nIt is all the more surprising, then, that he failed to recognise that for India's impoverished underclass, living in urban slums or tiny tents and hovels, \"staying at home to stay safe\" was a luxury they could not afford.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Informal economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suspension bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_safety_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social safety net"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Feebb7446-72a0-11ea-90ce-5fb6c07a27f2?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 859}, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 859, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6016553517", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-04-01", "time": "19:18:00", "dateTime": "2020-04-01T19:18:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-04-01T19:17:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/8b7bc787-4f33-4909-85f0-8df36d165b69", "title": "Amazon contractors enduring 'subhuman' conditions in Philippines ", "body": "Amazon has said it is urgently investigating claims of \"subhuman\" conditions at a Philippines call centre, where workers say coronavirus travel restrictions have left them sleeping in close quarters on makeshift beds.\n\nVideo footage and stills, taken at the weekend and provided to the Financial Times, appear to show several employees sleeping on the floor at a facility in Cebu City. One employee appears to have set up a bed on a treadmill.\n\nThe Amazon-contracted workers at the site, which is managed by managed by French outsourcing company Teleperformance, provide support to customers who have bought the US tech giant's internet-connected Ring camera systems.\n\nWhile it is typical for some Filipino call centre workers to sleep on-site to avoid long commutes, workers said lockdown restrictions meant the facility had been overwhelmed. Employees said they were only able to leave the site to buy groceries or use showers at a nearby hotel.\n\nAs a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, Cebu City has been put in a state of \"enhanced community quarantine\", with police-enforced movement restrictions and public transport shut down. Unable to take a daily commute, workers at the facility have been faced with a choice of remaining at the site round the clock or forgoing their work entirely.\n\nUNI Global Union said the Amazon contract stipulated that all work be done on-site. A Ring spokeswoman declined to go into specifics regarding the terms of its contract.\n\nIn a letter to their bosses, the workers say promises of adequate sleeping arrangements have not materialised, which has led to \"hundreds\" of workers sleeping in the facility, including on the call centre floor itself and in a small gym.\n\n\"We are urgently investigating these allegations and addressing them with Teleperformance at the most senior level,\" the Ring spokeswoman said.\n\n\"Ring does not tolerate violations of our vendor Code of Conduct, and we expect our vendors to follow government orders and recommendations regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, including our strict guidelines for social distancing.\"\n\nExecutives at Teleperformance declined to offer an immediate comment on the conditions.\n\nStreaming giant Netflix also contracts Teleperformance employees out of Cebu, though a spokesman said its workers had been encouraged to work at home -- and the vast majority were doing so.\n\nAmazon said its understanding of the sleeping arrangements was that they were voluntary. But the UNI Global Union, which advocates for call centre employees, said that since the outbreak of the virus, those on the Amazon contract were offered extra financial incentives -- the equivalent of three months' pay -- if the adherence to a normal work schedule was maintained to at least 95 per cent.\n\nIn their letter, workers said conditions had become \"subhuman\" after the travel ban meant staying at the location was their only option if they wished to get paid. \"Our choices are only between going to work or else to starve,\" the letter said. \"And you are all aware that in this desperate time, we will choose the former. But that does not excuse you from your responsibility to treat [us] fairly, as human beings.\"\n\nTeleperformance employees face severe penalties for talking to the media or sharing information about their work in any way. A contract seen by the FT suggested that workers would be considered liable for \"damages\" of \"at least\" 500,000 pesos -- roughly two years' salary -- for breaking confidentiality agreements, on top of losing their job.\n\n\"While it is not unprecedented for some number of call centre workers to stay overnight, housing hundreds of workers for weeks in extremely close quarters during a pandemic is a tragedy waiting to happen,\" said Christy Hoffman, UNI's general secretary.\n\n\"Teleperformance and clients like Amazon are responsible for providing workers safe, sanitary work conditions, and if they cannot do so, workers should not have to suffer because of their failure.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [],

As the Covid-19 outbreak threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems, it also presents a harrowing human dilemma. We have caught a glimpse of this in Italy. Distilled to its essentials, it can be expressed more or less as follows.\n\nDoctor A has one ventilator and two patients in the grip of the coronavirus. Arriving first at the hospital, patient B, a 65-year-old retiree thought to have only a slim, albeit still measurable, chance of survival, is being kept alive on the ventilator. Patient C, a 35-year old teacher who arrived later, is deteriorating fast, but is judged to have a high chance of recovery if transferred to the ventilator.\n\nConsidering this quandary in the abstract, my sense is that most people take a broadly utilitarian view: the doctor would be right, perhaps should even be compelled, to switch around the two patients. Physicians swear a sacred oath to uphold life. Transferring patient C to the ventilator would be the route most likely to do so.\n\nNow reframe the choice. Patient B is one of your parents. The doctor asks you for the family's permission to turn off the ventilator so it can be made available for patient C. Saying yes would entirely remove your mother or father's small, but real, chance of survival -- and perhaps, though you would never know, deny them another 20 years or so of life.\n\nMy wholly unscientific polling suggests that many, even most, minds change at this point. Broad ethical judgments are one thing. Life-and-death choices touching those we hold dearest are another. Parents, it is often observed, will sacrifice just about everything, including their own lives, to protect their children; doctors tell me that children often press them to do just about anything to prolong the lives of gravely ill, elderly parents.\n\nThe rapid advance of Covid-19 means the ventilator dilemma may soon be played out at hospitals across the advanced nations, as the pace of the pandemic outstrips the number of machines available to treat the most seriously infected. A big question will hang in the air. Who do we want to play God?\n\nIn the Lombardy region of northern Italy, the speed with which the virus overwhelmed even the most modern, well-equipped medical centres, appears to have left no time for a lengthy debate. Media reports from the region suggest it was left to hospitals and physicians to make rough-and-ready rationing decisions. As far as one can tell from broadcast interviews, they all took age as a starting point, although many added assessments of other conditions.\n\nSome Italian doctors have spoken of circumstances so dire and pressures so intense they were obliged to apply a straightforward cut-off age of 65. Others have cited thresholds of 70 or above, often applied in combination with calculations of the impact of underlying conditions on life expectancy. Broadly speaking, though, the ventilators were reserved for the young and relatively fit over the elderly, and often, infirm.\n\nThere is nothing new about rationing care. Health authorities do it all the time in their choices of drugs and treatments. In Britain, the government-sponsored National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has a mathematical formula that sets financial cost against added \"life-years\" when evaluating treatments that prolong the lives of the terminally ill. In nations without extensive public health systems, money and the marketplace do the rationing.\n\nDoctors' organisations, hospitals and health authorities in many nations have ethical protocols about the allocation of resources between patients. My own experience is that doctors in the NHS are usually conscious of the resource, as well as the human cost of the \"overtreatment\" of patients deemed to have reached the end of their natural lives.\n\nBeyond the west, of course, such philosophical debates are usually superfluous. For the largest segment of the world's population, these choices simply do not exist. How many ventilators will there be to share out in nations where billions have access, at best, only to the most basic healthcare? Covid-19 promises to reveal itself in its full horror as it travels south.\n\nBack in the rich world, existing protocols that might now be repurposed for application during the pandemic tend to be grounded in the utilitarian goal of maximising outcomes that preserve life. That means patient B giving up the ventilator for patient C -- or, more likely, being shuffled into a palliative care ward from the moment of admission to the hospital.\n\nYou will not hear many people, however, saying this out loud. No one wants to see the trade-off made explicit. The New York governor Andrew Cuomo spoke for political leaders everywhere when he was asked this week how his state would choose if there were more patients requiring ventilators than the numbers available. It was a question, Mr Cuomo said, he did not want to have to ask.\n\nThe politicians know that, if and when the pandemic confronts the families of the seriously sick with life-and-death choices, cold utilitarian logic may well dissolve as it competes with human emotion. Better to keep things vague and, if need be, shuffle off the decision. Most of us are probably content for doctors to play God -- as long, that is, they do not expect us to share the responsibility.

of exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to crack down on opponents who have been at the forefront of more than a year of mass anti-regime protests.\n\nWhile weekly demonstrations have all but ended as people are prevented from gathering and also fearful of contracting Covid-19, the authorities have extended the imprisonment of an opposition leader, arrested a prominent journalist and summoned dozens of activists for questioning, civil society groups say.\n\n\"The authorities are taking advantage of the fact that the international community has something else to focus on now and are distracted by the coronavirus,\" said Ahmed Benchemsi, north Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe north African state has witnessed huge protests since February 2019, with hundreds of thousands of Algerians taking to the streets at least twice a week to demand the departure of the military-backed regime.\n\nLast week, Karim Tabbou, an imprisoned opposition leader, was hauled before a judge to face a sudden trial the day before he was due to be released.\n\nHe was handed a one-year sentence, which means he will spend at least another six months behind bars. Neither he nor his lawyers knew about the court appearance in advance.\n\nThe charges related to \"incitement to violence\" and \"harming national security\" and refer to speeches he made criticising the role of the army in politics.\n\nThe authorities also detained Khaled Drareni, a journalist who has covered the protests extensively, on similar charges a week ago. Mr Drareni, who publishes a website covering opposition news, has more than 140,000 followers on Twitter.\n\nHe is also the Algeria correspondent for Reporters Sans Frontiers, the international press advocacy group.\n\nDaikha Dridi, an Algerian journalist and colleague of Mr Drareni on Radio M, an independent internet broadcaster, said his arrest was unexpected.\n\nMr Drareni was previously detained for three days last month after he filmed police at a demonstration arresting a well-known opposition activist.\n\n\"Khaled is being made to pay for his stubbornness,\" Ms Dridi said. \"He was called in several times over the past year and once the military police asked him to stop covering the protests and to stop referring to them as a revolution.\"\n\nThe arrests appear to be part of a larger campaign against dissent, Ms Dridi and others said.\n\nThe National Committee for the Liberation of Detainees, an Algerian civil society group, said dozens of activists across the country have been summoned to appear at police stations in recent days.\n\nAfter the coronavirus pandemic spread to Algeria, prominent figures within the opposition movement, including Mr Drareni, called for a suspension of the anti-government demonstrations.\n\nThe protests erupted after Abdelaziz Bouteflika, announced his intention to extend his 20 presidency by contesting elections, despite him being incapacitated by a stroke.\n\nIn a bid to quell the demonstrations, the military forced Mr Bouteflika to resign, but the leaderless protest movement managed to maintain its momentum and continued to press for a complete overhaul of the regime.\n\nThe military-backed authorities held a presidential election in December in which five pro-regime figures competed. Amid calls for a boycott, there was a low-turnout on polling day, but Abdelmadjid Tebboune, a former prime minister was announced the winner.\n\nThe protests continued until last month. Algeria, Africa's biggest gas exporter, faces mounting economic challenges as grapples with the double blow of the coronavirus outbreak and plunging oil prices.\n\nThe government announced it was cutting spending by 30 per cent in a bid to manage its diminishing resources.\n\nActivists say that as the regime expects to have to face more public discontent, it wants to silence critics who were vocal during the past year of dissent.\n\n\"I think they will continue settling political accounts [with opponents], said Mr Benchemsi. \"The coronavirus is for now sucking up all the media oxygen, they believe whatever they do will be under the radar.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

migrant camp on the mainland, as public health workers warn of a humanitarian disaster if the highly contagious disease takes hold in the overcrowded settlements.\n\nOn Tuesday, an asylum seeker who had been living in a camp outside Athens tested positive for the virus after giving birth at a clinic, the first recorded case among an estimated 60,000 refugees and migrants living in camps on the eastern Aegean Islands and remote areas of mainland Greece.\n\nIt is not clear where the woman contracted the virus.\n\nMigrants describe a climate of fear as they live packed together with little water, sanitation or information about the coronavirus crisis that is raging across Europe.\n\n\"What hope do we have of defending ourselves from corona? \" said Ahmad, on the phone from a camp under lockdown in northern Greece. He shares his small living space with five other men, his cooking facilities with dozens of people, and his camp recently had no running water for 10 days.\n\nSix people have also tested positive for coronavirus on the Greek island of Lesbos, home to the 20,000-strong Moria camp that activists say is particularly ill-equipped to handle an outbreak.\n\nResidents have been ordered not to leave the camp, even to collect their monthly stipend in the nearby town as police step up patrols on the roads nearby.\n\n\"There are areas in the Lesbos camp [...] where there is one water point for 1,300 people. There is one toilet for 167 people. And there is one shower for 200 people,\" says Apostolos Veizis, head of mission in Greece for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), or Doctors without Borders. \"So when we call for people to stay home, this is the paradox: what home?\"\n\nPublic health experts say the situation is not only a humanitarian failure, it risks undermining the fight against the pandemic in Europe.\n\n\"Either we include everyone in this strategy, or we strategically fail. Not including these populations is a recipe for failure for our whole society,\" said Karl Blanchet, a public health professor and director of the Geneva-based Centre for Education and Research in Humanitarian Action.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and MSF are calling for the immediate evacuation of overcrowded island camps. Sea Watch, a search and rescue group, has proposed that decommissioned cruise ships could house those who have been evacuated.\n\nThe European Commission says the risk of a coronavirus outbreak in the migrant camps is \"of concern to us and to the Greek authorities\" and is seeking to speed up the transfer of people from Greek islands -- which host some 41,000 in camps -- to the mainland.\n\nAthens has also announced measures to improve screening and limit groups or visitors, measures Mr Dr Veizis said would do little good given the already unhygienic, overcrowded conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, despite coronavirus being spread by close human contact, other countries in south-east Europe have been accelerating moves to corral migrants into camps.\n\nMigrants have been forced into makeshift settlements in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Serbia some migrants said they had no access to disinfectants or gloves and that camps were under military guard. In some camps, those with a fever said they were left among the camp population while others were whisked into isolation. Some anxious residents wondered whether a coronavirus outbreak had begun.\n\n\"The scariest thing is we have no idea who might be sick and who isn't,\" said Mohammed, living in Serbia's Sombor camp.\n\nMany Balkan states appeared to be trying to push migrants across their borders and into Serbia, where the migrant population in its camps climbed from 5,000 to 8,000 in just a few weeks.\n\n\"They [other Balkan states] have taken note of Serbia's relatively open stance and are pushing migrants into their territories as they try to get rid of migrants in this Covid-19 crisis period,\" said Stefan Lehmeier, the deputy director of International Rescue Committee in Europe, \"I'm not sure what governments intend to do -- the migrants cannot make themselves disappear.\"",

sides of the Atlantic have pushed the global economy into the sharpest downturn since the Great Depression, data released on Friday signalled.\n\nThe US economy shed 710,000 jobs in early March, ending 113 months of continuous job growth, in official figures that were far worse than economists had been expecting.\n\nThe shock US employment numbers came shortly after business surveys across Europe showed the services sector to be in deep trouble with the largest drop in activity and prospects for more than 20 years.\n\nThe head of the IMF has warned that the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic would be worse than the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"This is a crisis like no other,\" said Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, speaking at a conference organised by the World Health Organization on Friday. \"Never in the history of the IMF have we witnessed the world economy coming to a standstill,\" she said. \"It is way worse than the global financial crisis.\"\n\nWorse data was about to come in April, economists said, with many now forecasting double digit percentage declines in output in the second quarter as vast swaths of the world's two most advanced economic zones shut down.\n\nIndices of activity by purchasing managers in the eurozone, UK and Swedish purchasing managers' indices all fell around 20 points, from levels indicating a majority of companies were seeing business activity improving to levels below those seen at the worst point of the 2008-09 financial crisis.\n\nItaly, which went into lockdown first, had the weakest PMI index on record with a figure of 17.4, compared with a figure of 50 which represents the point at which an equal number of companies reported rising and falling activity.\n\n\"It's clear that the economy is contracting more quickly than ever before during peacetime,\" said Jack Allen-Reynolds, an economist at Capital Economics.\n\nThe terrible data have led economists to slash forecasts for global growth, which were around 3 per cent at the start of March for 2020. Economists at Bank of America have cut their estimates repeatedly and now expect a contraction of 2.7 per cent, \"considerably worse than the 2008-09 recession\".\n\nWith 10m initial claims for unemployment insurance reported in March in the US, economists expected weak payroll figures -- but the reality was much worse than forecast.\n\nDavid Riley, chief investment strategist at asset manager BlueBay, said: \"Today's report confirms, if this were needed, that the US and global economy is experiencing the most severe drop in output and income in modern history.\"\n\nGovernments and central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have responded with stimulus programmes designed to offer insurance to those who have lost regular work or companies who have seen revenues dry up much faster than in a normal recession.\n\nBut they cannot prevent the shutdowns having a devastating effect on current business conditions, which will continue until the spread of Covid-19 is brought under control and restrictions can slowly be lifted.\n\nAs the US and Europe prepare for an even more difficult month for their economies in April, all eyes will be on China to see whether its economy rebounds after lockdown restrictions begin to be relaxed.\n\nEven though some of China's business surveys have bounced, the service sector in the world's largest economy remains under severe strain with smaller private sector companies on Friday reporting activity still worse than in February, according to the Caixin survey.\n\nMiguel Chanco, senior Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that despite the easing of restrictions there was still \"no post-lockdown bounce\" to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [],

Boris Johnson woke to universally negative newspaper headlines on Thursday morning -- including from some titles usually supportive of his leadership.\n\nAfter the government disclosed that just 2,000 National Health Service staff in England had been tested for coronavirus, the Daily Mail declared it was the \"Statistic that humbles ministers\". Even the Daily Telegraph, where the prime minister spent most of his journalism career, splashed on virus testing, with the blunt headline \"Questions without answers\".\n\nPressure is mounting on the prime minister as the Covid-19 crisis deepens. Some ministers and Conservative MPs are concerned whether Mr Johnson and his advisers have a strategy to exit the nationwide lockdown.\n\nTempers are fraying at the heart of government as it tries to increase testing, boost the supply of protective equipment to NHS staff, and secure more hospital ventilators. \"It's fucking tense in there,\" said one Tory official, referring to the atmosphere in 10 Downing Street.\n\nA blame game is already under way and, for ministers and their aides, the primary target of their ire is the civil service and what they see as the state machinery's inability to deliver.\n\nOver the past fortnight, the Downing Street political team has been increasingly at odds with Mark Sedwill, cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, over how best to respond to the crisis.\n\nOne Number 10 insider said there was \"growing anger\" at Sir Mark's alleged \"inability to execute what needs to be done\".\n\nCriticism of Sir Mark is also coming from within Whitehall. His lack of Treasury experience has been identified by several civil servants as a flaw in his skills-set given that the pandemic threatens to wreak huge economic damage.\n\n\"People are saying that Jeremy Heywood would have handled things differently,\" said one senior civil servant. Lord Heywood, the former cabinet secretary who died in 2018, spent a big chunk of his career at the Treasury.\n\nA Cabinet Office spokesperson, responding to the allegations against Sir Mark, said: \"There is no truth to this. The cabinet secretary and PM are working in lockstep to protect the NHS and save lives during this period of unprecedented challenge.\"\n\nGus O'Donnell, another former cabinet secretary, said: \"It's always going to be difficult in Number 10\" as Mr Johnson seeks to make trade-offs between \"black and white\" medical advice and wider considerations about society and the economy.\n\nOne cabinet minister closely involved in responding to coronavirus said the leadership of key public bodies should also shoulder responsibility for the acute challenges.\n\n\"The NHS bureaucracy is something to behold. The conversations have been pure 'Thick of It',\" said the minister, referring to the BBC political satire.\n\n\"They're proud of their independence and won't yield for anyone. The same is true for Public Health England: they're the reason we don't have more testing. They want to control the whole tedious process.\" PHE is responsible for responding to public health emergencies.\n\nThe second target for blame for some Conservatives is those advising Mr Johnson, led by his chief aide Dominic Cummings.\n\nOne senior Tory insider described certain aides in Downing Street as \"inexperienced, unpleasant and naive\".\n\n\"There is a lot of tension in there because they realised they are desperately trying to make up ground,\" said the insider, claiming that Downing Street \"wasted a lot of time\" by previously accepting that Britons should be exposed to Covid-19 in order to gain \"herd immunity\".\n\nOne Downing Street insider defended the Number 10 team: \"This is an unprecedented global health crisis and everyone is focused fully on delivering the best possible response.\"\n\nMr Johnson has sought to improve his communications during the crisis by bringing in Isaac Levido, the Australian political strategist who ran the Conservative election campaign last year, and Gabriel Milland, a close ally of Mr Cummings who works for the consultancy firm Public First.\n\nBut while the government has honed its message on social distancing, it is struggling to explain its strategy for exiting the lockdown.\n\nMr Johnson released a video on Wednesday evening, filmed while he is self-isolating after falling ill with Covid-19, in which he said testing was \"how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end\".\n\nUltimately, Mr Johnson risks becoming the target for blame. Several Tory MPs expressed concerns about his demeanour in the latest video. \"I'm worried he is isolated, unwell and isn't receiving good advice,\" said one MP. Another said he looked \"dire\" and claimed there were fears in the parliamentary party that \"he doesn't have a grip\".\n\nThese concerns partly stem from how key decisions are made by a small group of ministers in daily meetings involving Mr Johnson, chancellor Rishi Sunak, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and health secretary Matt Hancock. These ministers are assisted by Sir Mark, chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance.\n\nThe arrangements have left many Tories feeling perplexed. One cabinet minister not involved in the daily meetings said she \"didn't have a clue\" about the basis for the decisions. Another MP said: \"It's like a black box in Number 10. No one knows what is going on.\"\n\nAlthough Mr Johnson bears final responsibility for how the government deals with coronavirus, his high approval ratings in opinion polls suggest the public are giving him the benefit of the doubt for now.\n\n\"Everyone is trying their best and he's not in trouble yet,\" said one ally of Mr Johnson. \"But the next few weeks are going to be very tough for all of us. It will get worse and he'll need all the support he can get.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":
