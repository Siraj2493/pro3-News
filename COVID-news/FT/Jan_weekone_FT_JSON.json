The virus outbreak has prompted widespread concern on Chinese social media and triggered memories of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars, that infected more than 8,000 people worldwide and killed over 700, including almost 300 in Hong Kong,.\n\nThe World Health Organization said, in a statement issued on Thursday, that Chinese authorities believed that the disease \"does not transmit readily between people\", but noted that it could cause severe illness in some patients.\n\nChinese health officials said on Sunday that they had identified 59 cases, with seven patients in critical condition. There has been no further statement on the possible spread of the disease in China, nor on the health of those who were severely affected. However, state television said on Thursday that eight of those who had been hospitalised had been treated in Wuhan, \"cured and discharged\".\n\nHong Kong, activated its \"serious\" response mechanism to the disease last week and, like other parts of the region, has ramped up screening at airports. Hong Kong legislators have called for more transparency from mainland Chinese health authorities about the outbreak.\n\nOfficials in China covered up the Sars outbreak for weeks before the growing death toll forced them to reveal the epidemic. International criticism of Beijing's handling of the outbreak led to wide-ranging reforms to disease control methods in the country.\n\nSophia Chan, Hong Kong's food and health secretary said on Wednesday that there had been 38 suspected cases in the territory. However, she said none had been confirmed as related to the Wuhan outbreak, adding that 21 patients had already been discharged from hospital.\n\nThe virus broke out between December 12 and 29. Some of those infected were employed at a market selling seafood and live animals in Wuhan that has since been closed for disinfection, according to Chinese disease control officials.\n\n\"The reported link to a wholesale fish and live animal market could indicate an exposure link to animals,\" the WHO said earlier this week.\n\nCoronaviruses in humans usually cause relatively harmless respiratory infections. However, two are deadly -- Sars and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which have each caused hundreds of deaths.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Region"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Media of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Chan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophia Chan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health_and_Social_Care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Health and Social Care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency and translucency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East respiratory syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinfectant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholesaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wholesaling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F91f3f8d0-328d-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "eventUri": "eng-5411056", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 15}, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 15, "relevance": 52}], "totalResults": 1, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 1}}
