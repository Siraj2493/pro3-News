Officials in Beijing said two patients had been diagnosed with the virus, while authorities in Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong, confirmed one case.\n\nMore than 20 patients have been transferred from Wuhan to the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen to receive treatment, according to three staff from Shenzhen People's Third Hospital.\n\nThe virus has killed three people and nine remain in critical condition since it was identified earlier this month. The World Health Organization tweeted on Monday the outbreak had most likely started with an animal source but also noted there had been \"some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts\".\n\nMost patients diagnosed with the virus have presented with relatively mild symptoms. Health authorities in Wuhan said on Monday that 25 patients have been released from hospital after recovering from the infection.\n\nBut the outbreak has evoked memories of the Sars outbreak that killed nearly 800 people more than 15 years ago after originating in China. The latest cases have also added to growing concerns ahead of the Chinese new year period next week, when millions will travel across the country to visit family.\n\nA study by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London estimated that more than 1,700 people in the city could have been infected with the disease by mid-January.\n\nIt is possible that the number of cases has been under-reported because in younger or fitter patients the symptoms might not be serious enough to warrant seeking treatment, according to experts.\n\nA patient diagnosed with the virus in Japan last week was released from hospital. Two people from Thailand diagnosed with the disease after travelling from Wuhan this month presented fever-like symptoms without becoming severely ill.\n\nSouth Korean authorities on Monday said they were increasing monitoring after the country confirmed its first case of the virus. A 35-year-old woman has been quarantined at a local hospital after arriving from China on Sunday, according to health officials.\n\nBefore this outbreak, six coronaviruses had been identified in humans. Four caused relatively mild cold-like symptoms while the other two, Sars and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), can be fatal.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

authorities moved to prevent aeroplanes and trains from leaving the city of more than 10m in a bid to contain a deadly Sars-like virus that has killed 17 people and infected nearly 600.\n\nThe measures, which include closing all of the city's public transport, went into effect at 10am local time and comes on the eve of China's lunar new year spring festival, the busiest period of travel in the country when hundreds of millions are expected to travel across the country. A total of 3bn trips will be made over the Chinese new year period, from January 10 to February 18, according to Xinhua, the Chinese news agency.\n\nSome Wuhan residents said they had attempted to depart the city before the ban was implemented but were unable to leave.\n\n\"I heard about the train cancellations in the middle of the night, but came to the station anyway in case I could change my ticket. It looks like that's not possible,\" said Li Lei, a 24-year-old who spoke to the Financial Times outside Hankou station in Wuhan. He planned to travel to his home city of Chongqing for the new year holiday.\n\nThe move to lock down the city on the eve of the world's biggest annual mass migration underlines the mounting pressure on Beijing to prevent a repeat of the Sars crisis in 2003, when nearly 800 people died and officials initially covered up the severity of the outbreak.\n\nBy Thursday, cases of the coronavirus, believed to have originated in a Wuhan market that sold meat and seafood, had been reported in multiple countries and the US. Measures to screen for the illness have been implemented worldwide.\n\nOne Wuhan resident said her 57-year-old mother had been experiencing symptoms of the virus for a week but was turned away from several hospitals.\n\n\"When we arrived at the hospital in the morning, staff said the pulmonology department was closed after four doctors had been diagnosed with coronavirus,\" said the person said who asked not to be named.\n\nA relative of a medical worker in Wuhan said the city lacked medical supplies to deal with the outbreak. \"There are not enough isolation wards and test kits,\" said the relative of a medical worker in Wuhan, asking not to be named.\n\nStreets in the city were deserted. People without face masks at a Wuhan train station were exhorted by station officials to put one on.\n\nBlocking movement during the new year period can cause social instability because it is the only time of year that many Chinese can see their families.\n\nIn 2008, a snowstorm prevented more than 100,000 migrant workers from leaving a train station in the southern city of Guangzhou and authorities struggled to control.\n\nCompared to the Sars outbreak, Beijing's reaction this time around has been much swifter. Sars is believed to have emerged in late 2002 but was only reported officially in February of 2003, giving it ample time to spread through the Chinese new year holiday.\n\n\"Beijing and Hong Kong governments' reaction this time have been much faster and more proactive than Sars,\" said Chi Lo, senior strategist for greater China at BNP Paribas Asset Management. \"In particular, Beijing is more transparent in its reporting and control mechanisms than during Sars, and China's public health system is now more experienced in handling the outbreak.\"\n\nHong Kong was particularly hit during the Sars outbreak and has been on high alert following the discovery of the latest virus. Residents rushed to buy face masks on Wednesday evening as news broke of the first confirmed case in the city. One pharmacy on Hong Kong island said it had sold out of its latest order of 200 boxes of masks within half an hour.\n\nAuthorities in the city confirmed a second case on Thursday.", "source": {"uri":

a deadly Sars-like virus, dozens of vendors line up for compensation after officials shut down the local market.\n\n\"Many people here got infected,\" said one vendor, referring to the virus that originated in the market and has now spread across the globe. Stallholders queueing outside the blue-shuttered stalls of the market were each receiving Rmb10,000 ($1,445) for lost business.\n\n\"We had live animals but nothing illegal,\" insisted another vendor, amid reports that the virus jumped from wild animals such as civet cats that were reportedly sold at the market.\n\nNearly two months after the first reports of a new virus emerged in Wuhan, authorities have shut down air-and-rail transport links into and out of the central city, China's seventh largest, which also acts as a transport hub to most of the country's metropolises.\n\nPeople swarmed the city's airport and train station on Wednesday night to try to beat the travel ban. As the death toll mounted to 17 and the number of infected rose to 599 across China and cases were reported throughout Asia as well as the US, worried residents descended on Wuhan's hospitals.\n\nCity authorities claim the air-and-rail travel ban and the closure of the market were evidence of decisive action to combat the spread of the disease. But with more than 100m Chinese about to travel for the lunar new year holiday, analysts question whether the slow release of information worsened the spread of the disease.\n\nChina only began a determined national drive after President Xi Jinping on Monday urged an all-out effort to curb the spread of the virus, and the Communist party threatened local officials who tried to cover it up, analysts said.\n\n\"The government has been trying to monopolise disease-related information from the very beginning,\" said Yanzhong Huang, a fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in the US.\n\nThe Chinese government's dissemination of information on the Wuhan virus is a dramatic improvement on 2003, when authorities covered up the Sars outbreak. This time, health authorities have released regular updates on the virus after patients began showing symptoms in late December.\n\nChinese authorities have isolated suspected patients, checked their contacts for infection, and identified and shared the virus' genetic profile with overseas researchers. \"China seems to be following best practices,\" said Jeffrey Koplan, a global disease expert at Emory University in the US.\n\nThe problem was the slow dissemination of this information, analysts said.\n\nWhen Chinese state media reported 27 cases of an unknown type of pneumonia in Wuhan on December 31, city authorities closed the market the next day, according to staff. Over the following two weeks, authorities in the city identified dozens of infections and said the cause was a virus similar to Sars.\n\nBut the city's bestselling commercial newspaper, the Wuhan Evening News, did not feature the outbreak on its front page for two weeks, between January 6 and January 19.\n\nChinese censors also initially instructed media to stick to reprinting official reports on the virus from central government-controlled media, severely restricting independent reporting, according to multiple journalists.\n\nIn one example, a Chinese reporter said this month that they were told by a medical professional that hospitals in the city were given a target of \"zero infections\" among staff, with hospital deans liable to be fired for failing to meet the target. As a result, medical staff were slow to report infections among nurses.\n\nBut the journalist's media outlet did not follow up on the information, the reporter said. This week, the Wuhan government suddenly admitted that 15 medical staff had been infected -- a development normally considered an important indicator of the virality of a disease.\n\n\"Until recently the government was saying [there were] no such infections. Does that mean the infection happened all at once?\" said the Council of Foreign Relations' Mr Huang of the medical staff cases.\n\nPart of the reason for the tightly controlled release of information was that Wuhan, a provincial capital, was hosting annual meetings of the top municipal and provincial officials from January 7 to 17.\n\n\"This is a major factor that the authorities in Wuhan city sought to project an air of calm and most likely delayed taking action to stop the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus,\" said Dali Yang, an expert on Chinese bureaucracy at the University of Chicago.\n\nSince Sars, China has built a world class network of disease control centres in all its big cities. Yet several cases were confirmed overseas in Thailand and Japan before infections were reported in Chinese cities other than Wuhan.\n\n\"The strength of the Chinese system, that [it] gets right down to the front line, was ultimately what got Sars under control,\" said a public health expert who declined to be named. \"There is a question of whether the alert [was] in place sufficiently quickly this time\".\n\nFollowing Mr Xi's statement, there have been stronger warnings on social media. \"Anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of cases out of self-interest will be nailed on a pillar of shame for eternity,\" the ruling party's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said on a social media account.\n\nIn Wuhan on Thursday, those who were unable to get away before the quarantine flocked to supermarkets and convenience stores to gather supplies while others crowded hospitals, worried they might have caught the disease. The atmosphere was of a city preparing for a siege rather than Spring Festival celebrations.\n\n\"I wouldn't normally visit a hospital with mild symptoms,\" said a 25-year-old woman surnamed Liu outside one of the city's hospitals. \"But I am more cautious after hearing about the virus.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

tumbled as fears over the spread of a Sars-like virus on the eve of the peak lunar new year travel season hit tourism and retail shares.\n\nHong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index fell 2.3 per cent in Tuesday trading, in its biggest one-day fall this year, after China's National Health Commission on Monday confirmed the first cases of human-to-human transition of the coronavirus.\n\nThat has fuelled concerns over the spread of the disease, which has infected 224 people and killed four ahead of the start of the new year break this weekend. Hong Kong was also hit after Moody's downgraded its credit rating late on Monday.\n\nRajiv Biswas, chief Asia Pacific economist at IHS Markit, said the outbreak was \"particularly concerning just as the Chinese new year season gets under way, with millions of Chinese tourists travelling both within China and to many popular Asian tourist destinations\".\n\nIn Hong Kong, consumer-related stocks dropped 2.4 per cent on fears the outbreak could affect spending over the lunar new year. Wharf Real Estate Investment, which operates Hong Kong shopping malls, fell over 3 per cent.\n\nChina's Shanghai Composite index was as much as 1.4 per cent lower. Shares in Shanghai International Airport, Air China and China Eastern all fell more than 2 per cent on concerns the virus could affect travel. The renminbi shed 0.4 per cent versus the dollar.\n\nMost people diagnosed with the new coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, have shown relatively mild symptoms. But the outbreak has evoked the 2003 Sars virus contagion, which also emerged from China and killed 800 people after officials initially attempted to cover up the epidemic.\n\nMr Biswas said the economic consequences of the virus were \"extremely concerning\" for Asia-Pacific. \"China's international tourism has boomed, so the risks of a\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Sars-like virus epidemic spreading globally have become even more severe,\" he said. Tourism, airlines and retail stocks were among those likely to be hardest hit.\n\nJefferies analysts said markets were jittery over concerns the virus would spread to more cities in China and elsewhere. A worst-case scenario -- an impact similar to Sars -- would hit Hong Kong particularly hard. The 2003 outbreak pummeled the city's stock market and economy.\n\n\"Hong Kong is very small and very compact,\" they said. \"Any news will impact all consumers significantly and quickly. China is very big, thus at this stage only consumer sentiment in the affected cities is negatively impacted.\"\n\nChinese-listed healthcare stocks rose on the news of human-to-human transmission. Shares in drugmakers Shanghai Shenqi Pharmaceutical and Zhende Medical, as well as several others, all climbed by the daily limit of 10 per cent.\n\nCitigroup said that while concerns over the outbreak could impact tourism and related industries in China, it was still too early to determine its severity. \"At the current stage, we cannot quantify the potential impact and need to monitor the trend during the Chinese new year [holiday],\" the banks' analysts said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

annual migration to travel home for the lunar new year holiday, authorities revealed a jump in the number of people infected with a deadly virus that has already killed nine people.\n\nSenior health officials said on Wednesday that 440 people had tested positive for the newly identified coronavirus in 13 provinces. They recommended that people in Wuhan avoid large gatherings.\n\nA team at the University of Hong Kong estimated on Tuesday that almost 1,700 people in Wuhan may have already been infected with the virus, and that it would have spread to 20 Chinese cities based on travel patterns and the cases that had so far been found overseas. Their findings were in line with estimates from Imperial College London.\n\nGabriel Leung, chair of public health medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said he expected a \"substantial upward revision\" to the estimate following news of confirmed cases in more overseas countries.\n\nChinese health officials on Wednesday warned that the virus could be mutating and that there could be further spread of the disease.\n\nUS health officials on Tuesday confirmed the first case of a person infected with the new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, is a man in his thirties just north of Seattle. He had travelled from Wuhan to the US.\n\nMacau, the Chinese territory neighbouring Hong Kong, reported its first case on Wednesday in a businesswoman from Wuhan. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have identified cases over the past week, all of which have been linked to the city in central China, while Thailand has confirmed four cases of the virus.\n\nChinese health authorities say evidence suggests the disease is transmitted through the respiratory tract.\n\nEarly cases of the virus were linked to a market in Wuhan that sells animals as well as seafood. The market was closed at the start of January in an attempt to contain the outbreak. Live chickens and wild animals destined for sale have now been banned from the city.\n\nAfter the initial outbreak, other patients were found that had not been in contact with the market.\n\n\"Our experts believe the cases are mostly linked to Wuhan,\" said Li Bin, vice-minister of China's National Health Commission, on Wednesday. \"There has already been human-to-human transmission and infection of medical workers and there is community-based transmission at a certain scale.\"\n\nProfessor Leung said the biggest questions were whether sustained human-to-human transmission would take place between people with no connection to Wuhan and if there was now more than one epicentre.\n\n\"Given those upward adjusted numbers, are they going to turn into a second or third epicentre? And\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the containment strategy within Wuhan, is that possible? That is, I think, that is the big unknown,\" he said, referring to government measures in response to the outbreak.\n\nThe city of Wuhan and Hubei province have been told to intensify their emergency response, and wild animals and live poultry destined for sale have been banned from the city. Temperature checks have been brought in to test people at airports, train stations, coach stations and ports.\n\nA strict isolation policy has been introduced for patients with a temperature as well as for their close contacts.\n\nThe whole country must now make daily reports, even if there are no new cases, Mr Li said on Wednesday.\n\nHealth authorities said anyone with a fever, coughing, difficulty breathing who had either visited Wuhan, or was in touch with someone who had visited the city should seek hospital treatment. The public was reminded to wash their hands regularly and to wear a mask in hospitals or clinics.\n\nGao Fu, head of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Monday that evidence had been found linking the new coronavirus to wildlife at the market. according to China Daily. However, the animal involved had not been identified.\n\nA 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), the deadly virus that killed more than 800 people, was passed to humans via contact with civet cats.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki",

from China in a bid to stop the coronavirus from taking hold on the island as governments around the world step up efforts to halt the spread of the Sars-like disease.\n\nThe move came as China said on Sunday 56 people had died from the disease, up from 42 a day earlier, while 1975 people were infected, including three in Taiwan.\n\nUnderlining international concern over the outbreak, the US State Department said on Sunday it was evacuating staff from its consulate in Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the epicentre of the disease. The virus has now also been detected in the US, France, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and Nepal.\n\nIn China, the national travel agency suspended Chinese tour groups travelling overseas and domestically over the lunar new year holiday that started this weekend while the city of Beijing has suspended all buses into and out of the capital from Sunday.\n\nThe travel restrictions in Beijing and other smaller cities, such as Xian and Shantou, come on top of a lockdown of more than 40m people living in Wuhan and surrounding areas.\n\nThe growing number of measures to deal with the outbreak, which also include closures of entertainment and tourist venues, are expected to deal a heavy blow to the world's second-biggest economy. China's gross domestic product grew at its slowest pace in 29 years last year.\n\nChina's president Xi Jinping said late on Saturday the country was facing a \"grave situation\" at a meeting of the Communist party's top leadership, the politburo standing committee, state television reported.\n\nThe escalating public health emergency comes as China celebrates the lunar new year, the most important holiday of the year in which hundreds of millions of people make billions of trips to celebrate with family and friends.\n\nTaiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre said on Sunday that due to the continuous increase in infections, all travellers from the Chinese province of Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital, including those studying in Taiwan, would be barred with immediate effect.\n\nTaipei said it would also suspend applications from Chinese citizens for travel permits except for special cases.\n\nThose Chinese citizens who already had a permit to travel to Taiwan would have their entry dates pushed back, and Chinese students studying in Taiwan who had gone home for the Lunar New Year break would have their return dates postponed by two weeks.\n\nBusiness travellers from China as well as Chinese spouses of Taiwanese citizens were still allowed to enter Taiwan but would be required to go into a self-regulated quarantine for two weeks.\n\nTaiwan has 3 confirmed cases and has another 156 undergoing quarantine and testing.\n\nIn Hong Kong, authorities on Sunday declared the city's highest level of emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak and said all schools would remain closed for a further two weeks beyond the lunar new year holiday.\n\nHong Kong's popular amusement parks Disneyland and Ocean Park were both closed from Sunday to help prevent the spread of the virus, Chinese state television reported, while Shanghai Disneyland has been closed since Saturday.\n\nMcDonald's said it had closed its restaurants in five Chinese cities while the country's leading cinema chains temporarily shut tens of thousands of movie theatres across the country. China's leading film studios cancelled their plans to release the biggest movie blockbusters of the year at the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, traditionally the commercial high point in the world for the cinema industry.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak could hit China's quarterly GDP growth, according to Barclays, taking into account the potential shocks to transportation, restaurants and hotels.\n\nIndia said it had urged its citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to China.\n\nWhile no cases have yet been confirmed in India, authorities have placed 11 people under observation, of

authorities quarantined the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak of a deadly Sars-like virus.\n\nChina's benchmark CSI 300 index dropped 2 per cent in Thursday trading, putting the index on course for its worst one-day performance since early July. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.5 per cent after the city confirmed its second case of the coronavirus, while China's currency weakened against the dollar.\n\nMarkets slipped after authorities on Thursday shut transport networks in Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the heart of the epidemic, in an attempt to limit the pathogen's spread. Hundreds of millions of people in China are travelling domestically and abroad for the long lunar new year holiday, raising fears over the virus's spread.\n\nMore than 500 people have been infected by the virus and 17 are dead. The outbreak has roiled markets this week.\n\n\"What makes this concerning\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009is that nobody really knows exactly how this is going to turn out,\" said Timothy Moe, chief Asia Pacific equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. He added that the longer-term effect on markets was \"really going to be contingent upon how far and fast this propagates and how the medical community is able to combat it\".\n\nChina's renminbi weakened 0.2 per cent to Rmb6.9198 per dollar. Mizuho currency strategist Ken Cheung Kin Tai said \"radical measures, in particular with shutting down the public transport and travel ban in Wuhan, signalled that the actual situation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009might be [more severe] than expected and could cause [a] panic mood in the market\".\n\nShares in Shanghai International Airport fell 1.7 per cent, taking their total loss for the week to 4.7 per cent, as analysts warned of a hit to the travel industry. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell 1.2 per cent at $62.44.\n\nIn Hong Kong, rail operator MTR dropped 1.8 per cent after the company announced it would suspend sales of tickets to Wuhan from the city's high speed railway station.\n\nCasino stocks listed in the territory tumbled after gambling hub Macau said it had cancelled all public celebrations for the lunar new year. Sands China shed 3.8 per cent and Galaxy Entertainment 2.8 per cent.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies said the impact on travel to Macau was still unclear, despite the government forecasting a 6 per cent decline in visits over the holiday. \"Anecdotally, we still have not heard of any hotel cancellations with rooms close to 100 per cent booked,\" they said.\n\nElsewhere in Asia-Pacific, Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 index dropped 0.8 per cent as Tokyo's Topix index fell 0.5 per cent.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sydney\n\nJanuary 25, 2020\n\nThe death toll in China from the coronavirus outbreak mounted on Saturday as the first confirmed cases were reported in Europe, Australia and Malaysia, raising global concern over the spread of the Sars-like disease.\n\nChina said the number of deaths had risen to 41 people from 25 on Friday and 1287 were now infected with the virus. It sent army medics to Wuhan, the central city that is the epicentre of the outbreak, to help overcrowded hospitals deal with the emergency.\n\nAuthorities also reported the first death of a doctor working on the front line of the outbreak in Wuhan on Saturday. While most of the fatalities have been in older people, authorities said a two-year-old girl had also been infected.\n\nThe mounting death toll comes on the first day of the lunar new year, the most important holiday in China, when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country to celebrate the festival with their families. Holidaymakers will make billions of trips during the festival, fuelling concerns over the spread of the virus.\n\nWhile all the deaths and the vast majority of confirmed cases are in China, the virus has also been detected in the US, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Nepal, aside from France and Australia.\n\nChina has shut down more than 10 cities around Wuhan, closing train and bus connections and other public transportation.\n\nThere are also roadblocks preventing most private cars from leaving Wuhan. Dozens of state-owned companies have been enlisted in relief efforts. A new quarantine hospital with 1,000 beds is expected to be completed early next month on the outskirts of Wuhan.\n\nAt a Marriott Hotel in Wuhan, dozens of medical staff from cities such as Shanghai arrived from late on Friday evening to help with treatment efforts. \"We have about 300 rooms here, and by the end of the day they should be filled with medical staff who have travelled to Wuhan,\" said hotel manager Ricky Liu.\n\nWhile the World Health Organisation has thanked Beijing for its co-operation and transparency in handling the outbreak, there is growing anger from people in Wuhan at the slow and opaque way the local authorities have responded.\n\nThere are calls online for Beijing to fire the Wuhan mayor and party secretary for their handling of the outbreak. A post on social media from a senior reporter at the province's top party newspaper calling for the mayor's resignation was rapidly censored on Friday.\n\nResearchers at Australia's University of Queensland believe they could have a vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus in as little as six months. A team of about 20 researchers from the university's School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences is trying to produce injectable doses in prefilled syringes that can be sent around the world.\n\nThe team was working \"until all hours of the night\" to find a vaccine, said Dr Keith Chappell, a member of the group. Due to the \"high pressure situation\", they might begin testing within four months.\n\nThe team is one of three being funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a global non-profit focused on developing vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, to accelerate the search for a vaccine. The two other teams are from Nasdaq-listed Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(FT)\n\nBe mindful of how we treat mental health Over the past few years, we have seen businesses commit with great fanfare to new mental health initiatives, from training mental health first-aiders to bringing in puppies and yoga classes. These projects are certainly well intentioned. But the sad truth is we have no idea if they work, or even if they cause more harm.

"title": "Coronavirus makes for dismal lunar new year for Wuhan residents", "body": "The Lunar New Year is traditionally a time for food, fun and family reunion across China. But for Wuhan resident Tang Yong, this year's festivities were marked with fear.\n\n\"During the New Year, we are meant to feel happy. But this year was lonely and no one was around. We are becoming more and more worried,\" said Ms Tang, 27, a marketing worker who lives with her parents in the central Chinese city that is the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak. \"I don't have a festive feeling,\" she added.\n\nThe Lunar New Year is the biggest annual festival in China but this week's nationwide celebrations have been hit hard by the outbreak. Disruptions were heaviest in Hubei, the province that includes Wuhan and where authorities have imposed a lockdown on more than 40m people.\n\nIn Wuhan this weekend, the streets were quiet as most people followed government advice to remain indoors. Ms Tang did not dare venture out to see relatives or stock up on lotus root -- a key component of New Year's eve meals in Hubei. \"I stayed home for five days and I will stay home ...basically for the whole spring festival,\" she said.\n\nFood was mostly well-supplied. On New Year's eve on Friday, a Carrefour supermarket in central Wuhan was busy with customers, with a sign at its entrance reading \"we promise not to run out of goods or raise prices\". But the mood was downbeat.\n\n\"There will be a different atmosphere for this New Year because we will not be having fun outside. We can only give our relatives New Year wishes over the phone,\" said one man in his late 30s surnamed Wang, who carried a basket of fresh vegetables.\n\nWuhan resident Sally Zhang, who works in a real estate company, usually gathers with up to 20 family members on New Year's eve. But this year she was spending the festival with just her husband, children and parents in law.\n\n\"The atmosphere is tense, everyone feels at risk, and there are significantly fewer people moving around the neighbourhood. Children are not going outside,\" she said.\n\nInstead of the usual family conversation and card games, Ms Zhang joined hundreds of millions in watching the annual New Year gala on state television, which featured a live link-up with a Wuhan hospital, alongside the usual glamorous song and dances.\n\nAs the programme was broadcast, the hashtag \"New Year's Eve in the intensive care unit\" trended on Chinese social media service Weibo. One often reposted social media comment read: \"Can you please send a responsible leader to Hubei?\"\n\nNeither President Xi Jinping or members of the ruling party's elite politburo standing committee have made public appearances in Hubei since the outbreak began.\n\nInstead of usual new year greetings, one of the most posted articles on China's top social media service WeChat was a call to donate masks and medical items to hospitals in Wuhan. Another widely reposted article called for the city's mayor to be sacked. It was promptly censored.\n\nNationwide, millions decided to call off large-scale family gatherings at home, cancelled books for restaurant meals with families and tourist trips after cities shut down tourist attractions and New Year events, such as fairs held at temples.\n\nTo help persuade people to change their plans, an image of a well-known Chinese doctor was shared by mobile phone accompanied with a message that read: \"Gatherings create trouble for society, one less meal won't hurt family ties\".\n\nZhou Ning, a cardiologist from Wuhan Tongji hospital, blogged on how he celebrated Lunar New Year eve dinner with his parents. But he sat away from them and wore two layers of surgical masks to avoid infecting them. \"I just could not break their heart,\" he wrote, explaining why he had gone ahead with the meal despite the risk of infection.\n\nFor thousands visiting hospitals in Wuhan over the New Year period, the situation was even more stressful. Outside the Red Cross hospital, a woman surnamed Song accompanied her elderly mother who had come down with a fever.\n\nHer husband had been on a work trip outside Wuhan, leaving him stuck outside the city, so she had left her seven-year-old daughter alone at home for most of the day, checking in using WeChat.\n\n\"I am not letting my daughter out of the house. I left food and other things she needs for her,\" she said. \"When I come home I will take a shower straight away, and I won't even look at her directly when we talk in case I breathe on her.\"",

"title": "Cautionary signs for bullish equity and credit investors", "body": "FT subscribers can click here to receive Market Forces every day by email.\n\nA divide between bullish equity sentiment and a more cautious outlook evident in government bond and gold markets has emerged of late -- and well before Thursday's retreat across global share markets and haven buying.\n\nSince early October the S&P 500 benchmark has risen 15 per cent while the FTSE All-World index is up about 13.5 per cent. A 10-year Treasury yield sitting around 1.71 per cent on Thursday remains above its multiyear lows of 1.50 per cent in October, which followed widespread talk of recession at the end of summer.\n\nBut what has shifted of late is how equities have extended those gains this month, building on a stellar 2019 performance (the S&P 500 is up 2.5 per cent for January), while the 10-year Treasury yield has dropped well inside 2 per cent. This trend was evident before Thursday's decline in government bonds yields, reflecting a retreat in global equities amid concern that China's coronavirus may weigh on economic activity.\n\nMoreover, the usual relationships that have coincided with a higher 10-year Treasury yield in the past, such as a stronger renminbi and a weaker Japanese yen, have not arisen lately.\n\nStable yields certainly help bolster bullish equity spirits as there is plenty of time before risk assets are judged by a rebound in economic activity that also bolsters earnings growth for companies in 2020. This combination of low yields and higher equities can be traced back to the actions of the Federal Reserve and other central banks. The Fed has pumped plenty of money into the short-term funding market since autumnal winds began blowing. Whether buying Treasury bills amounts to a form of quantitative easing or not is beside the point; the reaction across financial markets suggests investors have raised their risk appetite since the central bank became an active buyer of bills.\n\nOther havens, such as the Swiss franc and gold, have been in demand this month. A decline in the value of global negative-yielding debt to about $11tn has not prevented gold from staying above $1,550 an ounce (its highest level since April 2013). The precious metal is holding above its late-summer peak from August that coincided with negative-yielding debt rising beyond $17tn. Low and negative interest rates increase the appeal of holding gold, an asset that does provide an income stream. The recent decoupling between gold and yields -- shown below via this chart from BNY Mellon -- suggests a demand for portfolio insurance that goes beyond typical financial-based products.\n\nThat makes sense for investors with portfolios whose weighting in equities continues climbing given recent share market rallies. Plenty of unease is detectable as Wall Street, led by large multinationals and technology companies, has ventured beyond comfortable levels.\n\nDaniel Tenengauzer at BNY Mellon believes:\n\n\"Investors appear to be unwilling to buy optionality. With implied volatility in FX markets at a seasonally adjusted all-time low, many seem more interested in holding portfolio insurance through other exposures rather than through buying options.\"\n\nThe debate over the record run for Wall Street certainlydominates market conversation. Citi's Tobias Levkovich notes the bank's \"Panic/Euphoria Model is edging closer to euphoric territory, and thus it is something worth monitoring now\".\n\nTobias also asserts:\n\n\"One can contend that stocks look ridiculously cheap to bonds when viewing but we could equally argue that bonds are very overvalued but that has not stopped money flows from favouring fixed income over equities. In 1999 cash chased stock funds and now it may be pursuing bonds. We do not see the makings of a bear market based on our indicators. However, we do not see the pent-up demand that would generate a new S&P 500 or Nasdaq bubble either.\"\n\nThe euro slipped while Bund yields edged lower in the wake of Thursday's European Central Bank meeting. In truth, there was little new information for investors other than an outline of the ECB's first review of its monetary policy strategy in 16 years.\n\nThe question of how eurozone inflation is measured is a key component of the review. Housing costs currently have a much lower weighting than the share of income most people spend on rent or mortgages. Moreover, the ECB's calculation of inflation differs from that of the Fed (as housing is a far bigger weighting in US measures). It is a divergence that matters a great deal, argues Dhaval Joshi at BCA Research.\n\nA higher housing-cost weighting would entail higher inflation for Europe and thus limit the push into negative interest-rate territory. Or, as BCA noted last month:\n\n\"If Europeans and Americans were using the same definition of inflation then, one way or the other, their monetary policies would not be as deeply divergent as they are now. One important implication is that European currencies would not be as undervalued as they are now.\"\n\nChristopher Dembik at Saxo Bank notes:\n\n\"Any change in order to include housing prices could prove super hawkish. More basically, the review might also bring some clarity about what the objective of inflation really means. It could get rid of the 'below, but close to' 2 per cent inflation target and it could adopt a more flexible approach, ie a range of 1-3 per cent for instance.\"\n\nShare markets in China and Hong Kong fell sharply on Thursday with the coronavirus having killed 18 people and infected more than 600 in China, while Beijing has quarantined the city of Wuhan. China's CSI 300 slid 3.1 per cent in what was the index's worst one-day performance since May, although a factor in the selling pressure is a week-long lunar new year holiday that starts on Friday. It can only be hoped that a far more proactive response from China (versus the Sars outbreak in 2003) contains the situation.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial

is the latest round in an age-old struggle", "body": "In the story of humanity, communicable diseases play a starring role. From the bubonic plague to cholera to HIV, we have been locked in a struggle for supremacy with maladies for millennia. With several Chinese cities under curfew, infections in the hundreds and the potential for significant economic disruption, the efforts to protect public health from today's novel coronavirus are a striking example of this continuing contest. As governments and health authorities battle to stop the spread of the new virus, they would do well to consider lessons from history.\n\nThe exact effects and nature of the new strain of the coronavirus, a relative of the common cold, remain unknown. Experts are concerned about the speed at which it could mutate. Reporting suggests that animals may have been the original source -- as was the case with Sars, another virus in the same family -- reflecting the proximity which millions in China share with livestock. The emergence of new diseases has also been worsened by climate change, which has expanded the temperate region where pathogens can thrive, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nToday's strategy of containment -- one of the key measures deployed against endemic diseases -- would be familiar to civil authorities and medical personnel as far back as the ancient world. \"Quarantine\" has its roots in the Venetian Republic's 14th century efforts to keep out the plague. But the maritime power would have been hard-pressed to institute a cordon sanitaire on a Chinese scale. The ability to lock down cities the size of Wuhan, which is about as big as London, is a reflection of the power of Beijing's ever more authoritarian rule.\n\nMisinformation, and disinformation, are also still prevalent. During the outbreak of Spanish flu in 1918-19, conspiracy theories of enemy bioweapons circulated. An 1853 outbreak of yellow fever in New Orleans was blamed on immigrants. On social media, wild claims are already circulating that the coronavirus was manufactured on behalf of vested interests seeking to sell vaccines. Fear and mistrust may be one of the greatest challenges authorities face in eliminating infectious diseases.\n\nTechnological changes have proved to be a double-edged sword. Modern diagnostic techniques have sped up identification, while data science has made it easier to track the spread -- a far cry from John Snow's dot map of the 1854 cholera outbreak in London. But some advances, such as improved connectivity, have probably contributed to the rapid proliferation of the virus within China and abroad.\n\nEven global health co-operation has been less than straightforward. The conversation has far improved from 1851, when European nations sought to standardise maritime quarantines. Yet the WHO, despite its message of worldwide \"solidarity and co-operation\", continues to exclude Taiwan from key meetings and information sharing, under Chinese pressure. That risks creating a loophole for the coronavirus and future diseases. Pandemics and politics do not mix well.\n\nYet perspective is needed. Sars killed fewer than 800. Data so far suggests the coronavirus may have a lower mortality rate than its cousin, and is most lethal to those with weakened immune systems. It is the perennial scourge of influenza that most concerns pandemic watchers. An estimated 50m died from the Spanish flu. Even with modern medicine, US authorities estimate about 34,000 Americans died last flu season. Outbreaks of unidentified diseases demand vigilance and study. But novelty does not make them inherently more dangerous than older foes.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

the 57-year-old resident of Wuhan started having trouble breathing. She went to Hubei Provincial People's Hospital, one of the best in the city, where a doctor told her she might have a new virus that was starting to cause global alarm, but he could not actually test her.\n\nOver the course of the next week, she was turned away by four other hospitals in the city before a doctor at Xinhua Hospital told her that she probably had the virus and should go home and \"self-quarantine\".\n\n\"By then we had stopped trying as hospitals were either closed or packed with patients with different levels of symptoms,\" says Xie Jing, her daughter. \"We have spent several thousand yuan [renminbi] seeing doctors but we are still not sure if my mother is a virus carrier.\" She adds: \"Wuhan did a bad job in disease control.\"\n\nWuhan, a city of 11m, has enjoyed a few moments at the centre of modern Chinese history. One of the economic hubs of central China, it was twice briefly the capital under the nationalists and Mao Zedong took his famous swim in the Yangtze in Wuhan at the start of the cultural revolution.\n\nNow Wuhan is at the centre of an outbreak of a previously unknown coronavirus: nCoV, as it is known, has this week demonstrated some uncomfortable similarities with Sars, which killed almost 800 people between 2002 and 2004. The global economic costs of Sars were estimated at $50bn.\n\nBy mid-afternoon on Friday, 26 people had died and there were 881 confirmed cases of nCoV infection, according to Chinese state television, with another 1,073 suspected cases in 20 provinces across the country. Small numbers of cases have also been confirmed in the US, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau, but no deaths have been reported outside China.\n\nSince Wednesday, Wuhan has been under a near-lockdown with air and rail links suspended as the authorities try to limit the spread of infection. Paramilitary police stand guard outside the main railway station to prevent anyone entering while -- in contrast to the overcrowded hospitals -- the streets are largely empty ahead of the annual spring festival, the most important holiday in China when families come together to celebrate.\n\nYet some health experts fear the travel restrictions on Wuhan and other cities in Hubei have come too late, given that many of the 100m Chinese who cross the country every year to visit relatives had already made the trip.\n\nFor the authoritarian government of President Xi Jinping, who is under pressure over the protests in Hong Kong and the victory of an opponent in the Taiwanese elections, the outbreak of a new virus is a very public test of its ability to manage an international crisis -- and one that cannot easily be blamed on malign outside influences.\n\n\"The story the Communist party tries to perpetuate is that the Chinese government system is inherently superior because of its ability to maintain stability and growth,\" says Adam Ni, a former adviser to the Australian government and editor of the China Neican newsletter. \"Internal shocks can shatter the idea of the omnipotence of the party.\"\n\nThe outbreak came to the authorities' attention on December 29 when four workers at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market were admitted to hospital with pneumonia symptoms. \"It was detected because China had put in place a system specifically to pick up severe lower respiratory infections,\" says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization. Within two weeks, Chinese researchers had identified the pathogen as a new strain of the coronavirus and released its full genetic code to colleagues worldwide.\n\nBoth Sars and Mers, a related coronavirus, originally passed to humans through contact with animals -- civet cats and camels respectively -- and experts believe that nCoV came from live animals sold in the market. The actual source is under investigation. Although snakes have been mentioned as a possibility, many scientists believe that the virus originated in bats.\n\nInfectious disease crises require a mixture of extreme transparency and draconian controls. WHO officials have thanked Beijing for what Mr Tedros calls \"its co-operation and transparency\" -- in contrast to the three months taken for the country to notify the rest of the world about Sars in 2003. Health experts believe their counterparts in Beijing are trying to be as open as possible this time, though local officials in Wuhan may have tried to cover up the outbreak in its early stages.\n\nThe capacity of the Chinese system to marshal resources and give orders has been clear in Wuhan and its surrounding cities, where tens of millions of people have been placed in partial quarantine. Major tourist sites across the country, from the Forbidden City in Beijing to Shanghai Disneyland, have shut their doors, while companies that produce surgical masks have kept running over the holidays.\n\nOne 29-year-old Shanghai resident who declined to be named says he went to visit his parents in Wuhan on Tuesday and returned home on Thursday at 10am, just before the travel ban took effect. At 3pm, he got a knock on the door of his Pudong district flat. \"I was in my pyjamas only to find there was one police officer with two medical people in full gear in my living room,\" he says. \"They tracked me down and reached out to my landlord to get the key.\"\n\nThe visitors were \"polite but forceful\". He was told to stay at home and report his body temperature twice a day for the next week. When he posted an item about the visit on WeChat, he received responses from \"haters\" who accused him of spreading the virus by leaving Wuhan. \"But they have no idea how badly the local authorities are responding to the whole incident,\" he says.\n\nYet there may be downsides to Mr Xi's style of leadership for crisis management, with centralised decisions leading to inaction among lower officials concerned about taking the initiative over sensitive issues.\n\n\"This is yet another example of his concentration of power creating a political system that is prone to buck-passing and secrecy,\" says Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the US.\n\nThe president's position of power will not be affected but the new virus \"portends an extraordinarily difficult year\", he says. \"Xi is looking to build an empire, but instead, he'll be spending his time fighting domestic fires.\"\n\nDiscontent over the Communist party's management of the outbreak has so far largely been directed at the mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, with some online commentators calling for his resignation for earlier downplaying the severity of the virus.\n\nResidents were angry in particular that two events held in the city in early January -- a communal dinner with over 40,000 people and the distribution of 200,000 free tickets to tourist sites -- were not cancelled and might have worsened the spread of the virus.\n\nNot everyone is so critical of the official response. Wang Hongtao, 30, a video producer from Wuhan, spent time observing one of the main hospitals in the city in recent days. \"There was a long line of patients but everything seemed to be kept in order,\" he says. \"I don't believe there are hospitals that are turning infected patients away.\"\n\nSo far nCoV has killed 3-4 per cent of people infected, mainly those with underlying chronic disease, and caused severe illness in about a quarter. That compares with a 10 per cent fatality rate in Sars. Although the new virus does not pass easily between people, the Chinese authorities are detecting limited human to human transmission.\n\nJeremy Rossman, a virologist at the University of Kent in the UK, says: \"It is likely that the virus will continue to spread with rapid increases in case numbers over the coming weeks. However, it remains unclear if the disease will keep to its current low fatality rate and low incidence of person-to-person spread or whether the virus will adapt.\"\n\nAlthough no vaccine is available to prevent nCoV infection, a crash programme to develop one is under way. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, based in Oslo, is a $750m partnership set up in 2017 between governments, charities and industry to prevent future pandemics.\n\nCepi has launched three projects using different technologies to prepare nCoV vaccine candidates and aims to have one ready for testing on human volunteers within 16 weeks, says Richard Hatchett, the partnership's chief executive. \"There are no guarantees of success,\" he adds.\n\nAnother tool that would help fight the outbreak is a better diagnostic test. Health authorities in China and elsewhere are using tests that recognise the genetic sequences of nCoV but these are slow to perform and have to be carried out in specialist laboratories. One US company, Co-Diagnostics, says it has completed preliminary design work for a faster molecular screening test.\n\nNo drug has been developed to treat coronavirus infections, though some antivirals may help patients fight nCoV.\n\nAlthough medical science has made much progress in the 17 years since Sars, the new coronavirus will be stopped by using the same methods to break the chain of transmission, says Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\n\"You isolate the patients and make sure that the people caring for them have maximum protection against infection,\" he says. \"Then you trace everyone who has been in contact with the patient within the incubation period and look for any symptoms in them.\"\n\nNo cases of Sars have been detected anywhere since 2004. The world will be relieved if its sister virus can also be wiped out within a year.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

equity markets could hit even harder this week if the death toll continues to mount and the contagion's effects spread across and beyond Asia.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng, already buffeted by the US-China trade war and local protests, has taken the biggest knock. Over the past week it has fallen by 3.8 per cent, just ahead of China's CSI 300, which lost 3.5 per cent. Stock exchanges in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand, all of which have reported cases of the contagion, also sank.\n\nThe US, the first nation outside Asia to be affected, is yet to see any significant market impact. However, the S&P 500 closed up just 0.1 per cent on Thursday after the World Health Organisation said it was split on whether the epidemic qualified as an international emergency.\n\nThe outbreak has drawn comparisons with the 2003 outbreak of Sars, which left nearly 800 dead after sweeping through more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. Then, like now, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was hit the most, losing nearly a fifth of its value over six months.\n\nBrent crude dropped about 6 per cent over the week to $60.9 a barrel by late Friday -- its lowest level since early December -- with most traders pointing to the coronavirus as the cause of the sell-off.\n\nChina's renminbi, too, lost more than 1 per cent over the week against the US dollar to trade at Rmb6.9.\n\nShares in airlines and luxury goods makers were also under pressure. Air France and British Airways-owner IAG both slid about 6 per cent over the week, while Burberry, Richemont and LVMH -- luxury goods makers that are heavily reliant on Chinese sales -- were each down more than 4 per cent. The big beneficiaries: shares in Asian businesses that make rubber gloves and other surgical equipment.\n\n\"The potential spread [of the virus] is enormous,\" said Andrew Sullivan, Hong Kong-based director at broker Pearl Bridge Partners. \"Already we have seen retail and travel stocks hit, and I would expect to see that continue.\" Daniel Shane\n\nMark Carney's final interest-rate decision as Bank of England governor is poised to be among the most compelling. Investors are equally divided about what will happen, with swaps markets pricing a 50 per cent chance of a cut in rates to 0.5 per cent.\n\nMr Carney and some of his colleagues on the monetary policy committee talked up the case for lower rates in early January. A flurry of weak economic data showed the economy took a turn for the worse at the end of 2019 as the uncertainty surrounding the general election held back activity.\n\nBut signs of a post-election rebound have muddied the picture. Friday's purchasing managers data showed unexpectedly strong growth in business activity in January.\n\nMelanie Baker, a senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, argued a January rate move was \"unlikely\".\n\n\"After a business survey jump like this and with optimism higher, why not wait a bit longer to see how things play out?\" she said.\n\nBut some investors clearly believe the MPC will assign greater weight to official output data rather than surveys and sentiment indicators. That was the case during 2019, when the BoE ignored gloomy surveys and kept rates on hold, according to Jacqui Douglas, chief European macro strategist at TD Securities.\n\nShe said: \"Do they change tack now and say it's the survey data that matters? Our feeling is that the hard data has been weak enough to justify a rate cut.\"\n\nWith markets pricing the chance of a rate cut as a coin toss, the BoE is likely to trigger a sizeable reaction whatever it does on Thursday. Tommy Stubbington\n\nAt the Federal Reserve's final meeting of 2019, chairman Jay Powell made it clear the central bank was firmly on pause.\n\nAfter three consecutive interest rate cuts between July and October -- which brought the central bank's policy rate down to 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent -- officials at the Fed signalled confidence in the amount of accommodation they had provided the economy, given the ebbing of risks to the global growth outlook and the continued rude health of the US labour market.\n\nOfficials at the central bank will give more clues on Wednesday as to what may compel them to change that stance, when they meet in Washington for their first policy-setting meeting of 2020.\n\nTo date, Mr Powell has trained his focus on a few important indicators. In order for the central bank to lower interest rates further, he said there would need to be a \"material reassessment\" of the economic outlook, perhaps brought on by a re-escalation of the US-China trade war that played a large part in the Fed's decision to ease policy in the first place.\n\nBut for the Fed to move in the opposite direction and to raise interest rates, Mr Powell would need to see \"a significant move up in inflation that's also persistent,\" he said in December.\n\nIn fact, the Fed has gone so far as to say it is willing to let inflation run above its 2 per cent target to make up for the years inflation has run below this level. The bar for rate rises, then, seems very high.
