Residents in all three towns, which lie to the south-east of Milan, were told to stay indoors on Friday after six coronavirus cases were diagnosed.\n\nOn Sunday the Italian authorities announced that the total infection count had increased to more than 100; 89 of the cases are located in Lombardy, according to the region's president. Two elderly people have died in the outbreak.\n\nOther cases included 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia-Romagna and one reported case each in Lazio and Piedmont. Ansa, the Italian newswire, reported on Sunday that there were suspected but unconfirmed cases in Milan and the region of Umbria.\n\nThe special measures have been enforced across an area with a population of about 50,000 people. Residents have been instructed by the Italian government to stay in their homes and the country's civil protection agency has passed an emergency decree. Those who break the instruction risk fines or imprisonment.\n\nMilan mayor Giuseppe Sala said on Sunday that he had requested all schools in the city to shut for a week, and several large Italian companies, including the bank UniCredit, have instructed employees in the affected towns to not come into work.\n\nSeveral Serie A football fixtures, including Inter Milan's match against Sampdoria, have been suspended.\n\nFashion designer Armani said it would hold an empty show in Milan on Sunday, the final day of the city's fashion week; the event will instead be livestreamed online. MIDO, the world's largest eyewear trade fair, which is due to take place in Milan at the end of February, said it was suspending the event until June as a result of the outbreak.\n\nAuthorities in Veneto were reported to be considering suspending the Venice Carnival, which is currently taking place.\n\nMr Conte said Italy had adopted \"rigorous and meticulous controls\" after two Italian citizens in their late seventies died from the infection.\n\nLuca Zaia, regional governor of Veneto, said the rapid spread of the virus showed that local-to-local transmission had occurred and it would no longer be sufficient to try to isolate travellers from China to stem the outbreak.\n\nGiulio Gallera, a Lombardy councillor for welfare, tried to calm worried locals.\n\n\"The message we want to give is that in the area of the outbreak, the measures taken are efficient and positive,\" he told reporters. \"The aim is to contain the situation as much as possible.\"", "source": {"uri":

Hong Kong also intends to quarantine its citizens from the vessel, prompting a rebellion from some who say they would rather stay free in Japan.\n\nCarrie Lam, Hong Kong chief executive, said her government was working on plans to evacuate all 351 of the city's residents aboard the Diamond Princess with a chartered flight. She warned those passengers not to leave the ship by their own means as they would either be rejected by commercial flights or stopped on arrival in Hong Kong and quarantined for 14 days.\n\nJapan will only allow passengers with a negative test for the coronavirus to disembark. However, US and Hong Kong authorities say these tests do not guarantee that a person is free of the disease.\n\nIn an interview with Japanese broadcaster NHK on Tuesday, one of the officials responsible for the quarantine said it was the correct decision but acknowledged weaknesses in infection control on board the vessel.\n\n\"We don't have any facility suitable to quarantine such a large number of people on land,\" said Iwate Medical University professor Shigeru Sakurai.\n\nTwo officials involved in the quarantine have caught the disease. As of the last tally released on Tuesday evening, there were 542 confirmed cases of coronavirus on board the vessel, the largest outbreak outside China.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType":

decoupling of China and some developed countries. With factories shuttered and consumption stalled, multinational companies have been forced to shift production elsewhere. Apple has warned investors that its revenues will take a hit thanks to the outbreak.\n\nA gradual decoupling of global economies has been under way for a few years. The South Korean electronics group Samsung, for example, has been closing Chinese plants and opening others in Vietnam. Mexico has benefited from some US corporations moving their supply chains closer to home. But decoupling will undoubtedly speed up as Beijing's opacity in handling the coronavirus epidemic highlights the risks of doing business in China.\n\nThere are marked similarities between the virus and decoupling itself. There is what you see on the surface (masks and panic or supply chain shifts and profit warnings) and then there is what you can't know: how many victims the outbreak will claim or what the world will look like economically and politically in five to 10 years, as globalisation dissolves and divides deepen.\n\nStill, it is the job of a columnist to go out on a limb, so let me make a few predictions about what may lurk around the corner if the decoupling continues. An increased risk of violence in Taiwan, the inability of Europe to defend its own liberal democratic values, and a world in which smart devices can no longer speak to each other across borders are distinct possibilities. And all of these things could fundamentally reshape the global economy and geopolitics.\n\nThe most pressing issue in the short term is Taiwan. That's where most of the world's semiconductors are made, the majority of them by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, a contract chipmaker that supplies US companies, including Apple, and a number of Chinese firms. Semiconductors are a key area in which the Chinese are not yet technologically self-sufficient. In hardware (from routers to switches to handsets), areas of software, and in high-tech services, the Chinese have already largely decoupled from the US. Consider the success of homegrown firms such as the smartphone maker Xiaomi. Or the telecoms group Huawei's efforts to build bespoke Chinese operating systems. Or the fact that many of the most innovative new mobile apps are developed in China.\n\nBut semiconductors require huge amounts of capital investment and research effort. It could be a decade before China can fully develop its own industry. In the meantime, it will be dependent on Taiwan, which not only supplies US companies, but where support for democracy is growing. This begs the question of whether, or perhaps when, Taiwan's semiconductor industry might become a political hot potato, as both China and the US try to build their own independent high-tech sectors.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that Taiwan will be able to operate in both orbits indefinitely. As one telecoms analyst put it to me recently, \"What's happened in Hong Kong is fascinating and disturbing in part because it raises the question, what happens if the same thing occurs in Taiwan?\"\n\nDecoupling also presents an existential challenge for Europe. Last week, the EU came out with a new ethical framework for artificial intelligence, part of its attempt to carve out a \"third way\" system of tech governance that can exist between the surveillance state of China and the dominance of the big technology companies in the US. But Europe's telecoms market is dependent on Huawei equipment, which is cheaper than that of its competitors. As one European Commission official admitted to me, \"using Huawei in 5G is a foregone conclusion\". This is in large part because 2G, 3G and 4G systems in much of Europe have been built upon it. It would be too expensive to retrofit the system to build out 5G without Huawei today.\n\nIf using Huawei does present a security risk (and I've been told by any number of Europeans and Americans in both the public and private sector that it does) then one has to wonder if Europe actually has control over its tech governance. Does it have the ability to defend its own liberal values over privacy and data rights in a digital world? Decoupling may, for Europe, become similar to the debate about defence in general. Even if the EU has its own strategy, will it be able to enforce it?\n\nIt's possible, of course, that the US and Europe could come together in some sort of transatlantic tech standards alliance. This would be likely to involve US government subsidies for 5G, given the financial pressures on the European telecoms industry.\n\nBut if that doesn't happen, we may be moving towards a world reminiscent of decades past, when a business trip from the US to Japan or Europe involved having to carry an entirely different 3G phone. This time around, however, the communications gap would exist across the entire technology stack, in both the consumer and the industrial internet.\n\nImagine a world in which cross-border banking, online shopping and data sharing becomes bifurcated between two systems. That is a reality we may be heading towards. Apple and other tech companies would certainly take a valuation hit in such a future. But so would many others in industries beyond technology. As with coronavirus, the effects of decoupling will be both unpredictable and exponential.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

unveiling plans to shrink its operations in the US and Europe and warning the coronavirus outbreak and unrest in Hong Kong could hurt its business in 2020.\n\nThe London-based lender said it aims to cut annual costs by $4.5bn and shed $100bn of assets by the end of 2022 in an attempt to kick-start its stuttering business.\n\n\"Parts of our business are not delivering acceptable returns. We are therefore outlining a revised plan to increase returns for investors,\" said Noel Quinn, interim chief executive. \"We have already begun to implement this plan, which my management team and I are committed to executing at pace.\"\n\nHSBC said it expected the overhaul -- the bank's most radical since it narrowly survived a money-laundering scandal in Mexico in 2012 -- to cost it around $6bn in restructuring costs and $1.2bn of costs related to disposals, the majority of which will fall this year and next.\n\nHSBC said on Tuesday it would reduce the size of its investment bank by reducing the amount of assets adjusted for risk by around 35 per cent in Europe and 45 per cent in the US. It added it would redeploy the capital tied up in these businesses in higher-growth areas.\n\nThe bank also said it would shrink its sales and trading and equity research operations in Europe and move its structured products division from London to Asia.\n\nIn the US, where the bank has generated subpar returns for years, HSBC said it would \"reposition\" itself by slashing the size of its retail branch network by almost one-third, moving fixed-income trading to London, and reducing operating costs by 10 to 15 per cent.\n\nIt said it would make significant changes to the structure of the group by merging the \"back and middle office\" sections of its investment bank and commercial bank, stopping short of a full-scale merger of the two divisions.\n\nIt also unveiled plans to close its global private banking unit, which provides services to rich clients. The division will be merged with its retail banking unit.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, who heads the private bank, is leaving HSBC as a result of the changes, making him the highest-profile casualty of the restructuring so far. He was once tipped as a potential future CEO of the group.\n\nIn addition, the bank will suspend share buybacks \"given the high level of restructuring\" although it said it would maintain its dividend and keep its core equity tier 1 ratio -- a key measure of balance sheet strength -- between 14 and 15 per cent.\n\nHSBC said the changes would enable it to generate a return on tangible equity -- an important measure of profitability -- of between 10 and 12 per cent by 2022, compared with the 8.4 per cent it reported for 2019.\n\nThe bank unveiled the overhaul as it reported a pre-tax loss of $3.9bn for the fourth quarter, after taking a $7.3bn writedown on the value of its investment and commercial banks in Europe, which it blamed on \"lower long-term economic growth rate assumptions.\"\n\nAdjusted pre-tax profits for the fourth quarter were up 29 per cent to $4.3bn, ahead of consensus estimates of $3.9bn.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

With demand in Japan now suffering a fresh hit from the coronavirus outbreak, it points to a rocky economic outlook for the rest of the year.\n\n\"The sharp fall in output in the fourth quarter means that October's sales tax hike hit the economy harder than most had been anticipating,\" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.\n\nJapan's Topix stock market barometer dropped more than 1 per cent after the release of the figures from the Cabinet Office on Monday morning.\n\nConsumption, which fell at an annualised rate of 11 per cent, was the main cause of the fall in output, but business investment also fell at a 14 per cent pace.\n\nThere was no real bright spot in the data. Final sales of domestic product -- which strips out inventory movements to give the best reading of underlying demand in the economy -- fell at a 6.7 per cent rate.\n\nMr Abe had vowed to avoid a similar economic trauma caused by the 2014 rise in consumption tax with an elaborate set of offsetting stimulus measures, including a system of cashback points for spending in small retailers.\n\nThere were some signs that the measures had made shoppers less likely to bring demand forward to beat the tax rise, but it has still dealt a blow to consumers who have been struggling with low levels of real income growth.\n\nAfter launching a large monetary stimulus in 2013, the Bank of Japan has become reluctant to ease monetary policy any further because it fears there will be negative side effects on the financial system.\n\nIt will now have to assess if there is any risk of a downward spiral in demand. Consumption by Chinese tourists has become important to Japan's economy in recent years but tourism has all but ceased in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nMr Abe's government has already launched a fresh fiscal stimulus to take effect in 2020, offering some support to demand.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumption tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinzo_Abe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shinzo Abe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Economics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fed37bb0a-5123-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "eventUri": "eng-5524295", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 220}, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1451558845", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-18", "time": "01:35:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-18T01:35:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-18T01:35:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/60e0ea28-043c-36e7-a1b9-a90359655dbb", "title": "Coronavirus latest: China reports 98 new deaths as number of infections reaches 72,436", "body": "Japanese stocks slide almost 1% after Apple sales warning\n\nJapan's equities market has come under pressure after Apple warned the coronavirus outbreak will cause it to miss its quarterly sales target.\n\nThe country's Topix stock gauge dropped 0.8 per cent in morning dealings in Tokyo.

A leading candidate is from China, which has repeatedly drawn criticism for allowing counterfeiting and illegal expropriation of IP.\n\nEstablished in 1967, Wipo is one of 15 UN \"specialised agencies\". Its particular job is to promote IP protection, help businesses and individuals obtain IP rights, and increase accessibility to IP information. Wipo regulates systems managing 43m patent documents. This treasure trove includes unpublished patent applications and commercially sensitive information from more than 200 jurisdictions and patent information collections.\n\nWhen patents and trade secrets are stolen, counterfeit goods are produced and traded openly. Trademarks are infringed. Competition is stymied. Revenues diminish. Governments, businesses and consumers all lose.\n\nInternational IP rules underpin the innovation economy. The US believes that giving control of Wipo to a representative of China would be a terrible mistake. China is responsible for 85 per cent of counterfeits seized by US border officials; and Chinese IP theft costs the American economy between $225bn and $600bn annually. IP infringements cost European firms billions of euros each year. In the developing world, Chinese counterfeits have damaged the handmade traditional textile industry in Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Guinea.\n\nIf China were to match western standards for IP protection and enforcement, it might be in a position to provide a leader for Wipo. That day is certainly not today.\n\nChina's Wipo gambit is part of a broader strategy to gain control over the 15 specialised agencies of the UN. China already leads four of the UN specialised agencies while no other country leads more than one, and Chinese nationals hold the number two post at seven of them, including Wipo.\n\nThe top spots of five UN specialised agencies will be up for grabs in 2021, including the International Labour Organization, International Fund for Agricultural Development, World Tourism Organization, Unesco and the UN International Development Organization.\n\nThree more face elections in 2022, including the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization.\n\nThese UN agencies play a significant role in our modern health, communications and transportation systems, as the WHO's crucial role in fighting the coronavirus outbreak reminds us.\n\nAlthough China has not yet put forward candidates for any of these jobs, if past is prologue Beijing will be competing for a number of them with either Chinese candidates or proxies from countries deeply in debt to China.\n\nWhen it comes to these selection processes, China is likely to seek and receive support from countries where it has become a major donor or source of aid. Research by AidData found African countries that received larger amounts of aid voted more frequently with China at the UN. At least three Chinese nationals, Ng Lap Seng, Shiwei Yan and Heidi Hong Piao, have been convicted of bribing a UN official.\n\nBeijing offered to cancel debts for some African nations ahead of last year's election of the director-general of the Food and Agricultural Organization. The Chinese candidate won.\n\nWhile in leadership roles, Chinese officials often steer the UN agenda to suit its interests.\n\nDuring Fang Liu's second term heading ICAO, Taiwan was not invited to the aviation body's 2016 general assembly. Most recently, ICAO blocked Twitter users who made references to Taiwan's participation in international organisations amid the global response to coronavirus.\n\nAt the ITU, which is headed by China's Zhao Houlin, Chinese companies are helping to shape new facial recognition and surveillance standards at a time when Beijing's use of the technology to track members of the country's Uighur minority in Xinjiang has been criticised. Mr Zhao has also defended the Chinese telecommunications group, Huawei, against American criticism.\n\nIt is imperative the US and other Wipo members that are concerned about IP protection and its positive effect on investment and innovation wake up. If we are serious about IP's ability to drive economic growth, we need a Wipo leader who will promote the protection and enforcement of IP rights everywhere. The US and the rest of the UN must also act quickly to assess -- and counteract -- China's broader efforts to control other international organisations.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType":

School\n\nI recently asked some investment managers how they might immunise their portfolios against fallout from China's coronavirus. \"I wouldn't,\" one scoffed, \"the virus is temporary.\" Another rattled off some ideas but added \"no one is actually positioning their portfolio that way\".\n\nInvestors have been conditioned to believe that disturbances such as mad cow disease, Sars, and now the coronavirus are temporary blips. Even if that proves to be correct, interruptions to global supply chains may cause greater problems for growth and markets than investors are expecting.\n\nSigns of complacency about the coronavirus abound. According to Bank of America's February global survey of fund managers, cash comprises only 4 per cent of portfolios, the lowest since March 2013. When investors are worried, they tend to hold more cash. Instead, they've been putting their money into global equities, which keep hitting record highs.\n\nInvestors appear to view the coronavirus like a minor traffic jam: disruptive but, in economic and financial terms, something you get past quickly. They are making two assumptions. First, the coronavirus will be contained shortly, pent-up demand will be released and its impact is therefore transitory. Second, if the epidemic isn't contained quickly, policymakers will step in to fix the mess with actions that send asset prices soaring. Either way, buy the dip.\n\nChinese authorities are already throwing the proverbial kitchen sink at their economy. The Ministry of Finance, People's Bank of China, and regulators have all announced measures to reduce the burden for firms and households. If the drag on growth is sustained or market turmoil spreads, investors assume other central banks will also act.\n\nBut what if the coronavirus fallout is more like sitting in traffic hours after an accident scene is cleared? Demand may recover quickly, but the supply side is much more problematic. Chinese firms are integrated into complex, global supply chains and the enthusiasm for \"just in time\" manufacturing, which involves thin inventories, leaves little buffer for disruptions.\n\nBottlenecks could develop as production ramps back up. Say one of the parts for your product comes from Hubei, the province at the centre of the coronavirus. To resume normal activities, factories must reopen and workers must travel back to them after being forced by the virus to extend their Lunar New Year holiday. More than one-third of China's labour force are rural migrant workers. Then truck drivers must transport goods to the coast and ports must reopen. If any one of those steps is hampered, the factories might as well still be at least partially closed.\n\nLarge companies will use airfreight for their parts, but this will eat into margins. If the supply chain disruptions persist, smaller firms may have to find new suppliers or risk going out of business. This isn't easy; if western firms had a simple alternative to China for inputs, the US-China trade war probably would have led to supply chain shifts already.\n\nHubei is a cog in global supply chains in autos, healthcare, electronics, aerospace and defence and construction materials. The outbreak has already pushed South Korean firms Hyundai and Kia to halt production.\n\nFinally, there is a problem with relying on policymakers to clean up the mess. Their tools are designed to stimulate demand, not fix supply interruptions. \"I've only been at the Fed for two years,\" Richmond Federal Reserve Bank president Tom Barkin told me. \"But to my mind, central banks can't come up with vaccines.\"\n\nMost investors assume the coronavirus will be contained by late March and that, as winter ends, so will the epidemic. But we cannot be sure the outbreak has a natural peak. If the virus becomes a full-blown global pandemic, growth and markets will be hit much harder than investors are assuming.\n\nSo what can you do? While there's much we don't know about this disease, we do know it has increased uncertainty, and if you think it may be worse than Wall Street is wagering, there are cheap ways to insure against a market decline. Uncertainty tends to breed volatility, so one strategy is to buy the Vix index, which goes up with volatility. Another is to buy the Skew Index, which focuses on options that make money if there is a big fall in the stock market.\n\nAnother way to immunise your portfolio is to invest in safe haven assets, including the US dollar, Treasuries and precious metals. Prices for these assets have risen over the past two months, but they could go higher still if investors decide their wait-and-see approach is wrong. Consider shorting the Japanese yen, traditionally a safe haven asset, given the country's high exposure to the coronavirus.\n\nIf you want to stay in equities, look to utilities, internet, education and -- no surprise here -- healthcare. Sectors to short include commodities, particularly oil, airlines, entertainment and luxury goods.\n\nInvestors may be right that this will be temporary.

Australia, the US and New Zealand are among more than a dozen nations to impose a ban on entry to anyone who is neither a citizen nor a permanent resident if they travelled in China within the past 14 days. The measures, aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus, pose a multibillion-dollar threat to western universities, which have become increasingly reliant on income from Chinese students.\n\n\"Australia seems like it has the toughest attitude to overseas students. Some students could reconsider their places if the situation doesn't change,\" said Ms Gao, who was due to fly to Sydney on February 9 but is stranded in China along with 100,000 other students with places at Australian colleges and universities.\n\nUniversities in North America and Europe have also increasingly relied on income from Chinese students. Many have been forced to suspend classes with Chinese students stranded abroad or in quarantine, scramble to provide alternative tuition online and are watching to see whether the next round of applicants will be reduced with entrance exams delayed.\n\n\"We are teaching 400 Chinese students online and have cancelled recruitment fairs,\" said Gianmario Verona, rector at Bocconi University in Milan. \"It is potentially an issue for this coming academic year.\"\n\nThe number of Chinese studying overseas has doubled to 869,000 in the decade to 2017, according to the Sydney-based Centre for Independent Studies think-tank. In the US, there were more than 300,000 Chinese students in 2018-19, according to the Institute of International Education. In the UK, more than 86,000 Chinese enrolled in higher education last year.\n\nAustralia is still more vulnerable: one in 10 students at its top eight universities is Chinese, the highest ratio in the developed world. The International Education Association of Australia warned this month of a A$6bn-A$8bn hit if Chinese students cannot attend the first term.\n\n\"The coronavirus epidemic has exposed Australian universities' unparalleled exposure to the China market,\" said Salvatore Babones, associate professor at University of Sydney, who wrote a recent report on the risk of an overreliance on Chinese students. At his university alone, they generated about A$500m in fees in 2017 -- almost a quarter of its A$2.3bn revenue.\n\nThe recent travel bans sparked protests this month in Sydney and Melbourne, with concerns about racism underpinning the move.\n\n\"There is no doubt this is damaging Australia's reputation among Chinese students,\" said Abbey Shi, general secretary at the University of Sydney's student council. \"They are angry and some are already diverting their plans to study in Canada, UK or elsewhere. No one wants to pay A$40,000 year to end up doing online courses back in China.\"\n\nUniversities Australia, which represents the sector, played down the long-term damage. \"I have not heard of any evidence of cancellations. I think students are still in the process of assessing what their options are,\" said Catriona Jackson, its chief executive.\n\nUS universities began their spring term in mid-January, which means most students had returned from China before the travel restrictions were imposed. Still, some have complained about the stigma created.\n\nYinan Dong, a graduate student at Columbia University in New York, said: \"A strict ban will help stop the virus spreading. But we also noticed that a lot of people\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009are very unwelcoming to people from China.\"\n\nUcas, the UK's university clearing house, said it had not yet observed a dip in Chinese student applications, adding that extensions \"will be considered\" to the usual deadline for exam results by the end of August.\n\nAnalysts pointed out that the coronavirus hit to universities comes as they are already suffering because of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. The Trump administration has tightened visa rules on Chinese graduates of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n\nSome US universities have taken out insurance policies against a potential drop in overseas students. A number of Australian universities unsuccessfully sought similar cover, and have been trying to diversify their international student intake.\n\nMonash University said recently that it had become the first foreign higher education institution authorised to open a fully fledged branch campus in Indonesia. Other institutions are targeting Malaysia, India, Thailand and other Asian economies.\n\nBut critics said these efforts would not prevent financial hardship. \"Diversification won't solve that problem,\" said Mr Babones. \"There aren't enough international students in the world to substitute for Australia's China exposure. The only solution is for Australian universities to dial down international student numbers to more reasonable levels.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"},

and a neighbouring metropolis \"special care zones\" in a bid to contain one of the worst new outbreaks of the coronavirus outside China.\n\nThe emergency measures, in which authorities have told citizens of Daegu and neighbouring Cheongdo to confine themselves to their homes, came as authorities in China reported a sharp rise in patients in Beijing and as three Chinese provinces revealed outbreaks in their prisons.\n\nSouth Korea on Friday reported 52 new cases of the Covid-19 virus, including 33 cases traced to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus religious sect in Daegu, 235km south-east of Seoul. The city is also the site of a large US army base.\n\nThe new cases brought the country's total number of people infected to 156, according to South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nKwon Young-jin, the major of Daegu -- South Korea's fourth-largest city with 2.4m people, asked citizens to avoid travel, stay home and wear masks even indoors. His call came as South Korea's Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun pledged to supply more hospital beds, medical personnel and equipment to the stricken city.\n\n\"I am so worried that I hardly go outside. Few people are seen on the streets. My social gatherings including choir and orchestra practices have all been suspended,\" said Kang Hye-sook, a 71-year-old resident of Daegu. \"I hope this will be over soon but I am afraid the virus is likely to spread further.\"\n\nBeijing has reported an overall decline in new cases from the coronavirus epidemic in recent days but new outbreaks are continuing to flare up within China and abroad.\n\nOn Thursday, eight medical staff, nine cleaners and 19 patients at the Fuxing Hospital in Beijing were suspected of having caught the virus, the city's government said. There were also three confirmed cases at Peking University People's Hospital, also in Beijing.\n\nElsewhere in China, in the provinces of Hubei, Shandong and Zhejiang, authorities reported a total of 449 new cases in prisons.\n\nIn Seoul, the city government said it would ban public rallies in the central business district and close down Shincheonji's churches. It announced it would also temporarily shut more than 3,000 public welfare facilities across the capital.\n\nExperts said more infections were likely among Shincheonji followers. Daegu authorities said on Friday more than 400 church members of 3,000 surveyed in the city were showing symptoms.\n\nThe US army garrison in Daegu said active duty soldiers were not permitted to visit off-base establishments, such as grocery stores, restaurants and other public gatherings. They should also not visit the Shincheonji church, it said on its Facebook page.\n\n\"The outbreak of the disease was caused by a devil that wants to block Shincheonji's rapid rise,\" said Lee Man-hee, the founder of the fringe church group, in his letter to followers.\n\nMr Lee, who set up the church in 1984, is revered as a messiah by his followers. He asked them to attend online services as the church temporarily closed its 74 centres around the country.\n\nPastor Shin Hyun-uk, an anti-cult campaigner, cautioned that the church's secretive nature and its aggressive evangelical campaigns would help spread the disease further in Daegu.\n\n\"About 80 per cent of the followers hide their religious belief even from their family members. Many of them will be reluctant to come forward, even if they have symptoms, because they don't want to be identified as Shincheonji followers,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType":

shortages of everyday goods in Hong Kong that thieves have held up a supermarket in the city to steal a delivery of toilet paper.\n\nTwo men were arrested on Monday after they allegedly used a knife to steal the loo roll, as fears over the deadly coronavirus have led to panic-buying in the city of not only toiletries but also rice and cleaning products.\n\nPolice said the men were detained following the alleged theft and that part of the loot had been recovered from a hotel in the city's busy Mong Kok market district. Officers said they were still searching for a third suspect.\n\nThe panic-buying in Hong Kong came as the economic effects of the covid-19 outbreak that has infected more than 70,000 people reverberated around the region's economies.\n\nSingapore slashed its growth forecast citing the effects from the virus on tourism and trade. \"The covid-19 outbreak is expected to affect the Singapore economy through several channels,\" the city-state's ministry of trade and industry said on Monday. It revised its annual GDP growth estimate down to -0.5 to -1.5 per cent, from 0.5 to 2.5 per cent.\n\nThe virus had led to 1,770 deaths in mainland China at the latest count released on Monday, with 100 of the 105 new fatalities recorded in Hubei, the province at the centre of the outbreak. There were 2,048 new cases, taking the total to 70,548.\n\nAs Beijing sought to soften the economic impact of an outbreak that has resonated around the world, China's central bank on Monday moved to cut the rate it uses as a low point for its lending benchmark -- driving Chinese equities higher.\n\nThe People's Bank of China cut its medium-term lending facility rate by 0.1 percentage points to 3.15 per cent on Rmb200bn ($28.6bn) worth of loans that were offered. The central bank had already cut its short-term lending rate as markets returned from the extended lunar new year holiday.\n\nThe liquidity injection helped rally stocks, with the CSI 300 index of major Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed stocks rising 2 per cent.\n\nSouth Korea also said on Monday it planned to extend Won420bn ($356m) in emergency loans to support struggling airlines, shipping companies, travel agencies and retailers facing a liquidity crunch due to growing fears over the virus' spread.\n\nIn Singapore, fears over the impact of the virus were set to hurt domestic consumption and tourism, the ministry said. The city-state's tourism board said last week it expected the arrivals this year to fall by at least a quarter.\n\nHong Kong has been badly affected by the fallout from the virus, which follows a months-long protest movement that also disrupted the economy.\n\nAs rumours of shortages have prompted a rush to stockpile, stores have limited sales of toilet paper to two packs per customer.\n\nSupermarket deliveries of multiple pallets of toilet paper have sold out within minutes as customers rush to join queues to buy the daily necessity.\n\nFacial tissues and kitchen roll have also been selling out quickly and were not available in supermarkets and pharmacies while face masks and hand sanitisers were often sold out.\n\nSupplies of food staples such as rice as well as bleach and other cleaning products were also in short supply.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

in the central province of Jiangxi. Then she switched to a more lucrative trade -- feeding China's voracious appetite for exotic animals, the consumption of which many believe is at the root of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"Raising wild animals is more profitable than growing crops,\" said Ms Wang. She farms civet cats, a raccoon-like animal, and made a profit of Rmb50,000 ($7,140) last year by selling 33 full-grown animals -- more than twice what she would have made from growing rice.\n\nParts of China have a tradition of consuming exotic wild animals as food or medicine, despite the implication of some species such as civet cats in the Sars epidemic 17 years ago. Now the animal trade's suspected role in the deadly coronavirus outbreak has put the practice in the sights of China's senior leadership. The executive body of the country's parliament, is expected to review measures to curb the business on Monday.\n\n\"We must resolutely close and crack down on illegal wild animal market and trade,\" President Xi Jinping said this month. \"The bad habit of eating wildlife without limits must be abandoned.\"\n\nThe outbreak is thought to have started in a wet market in the city of Wuhan where animals are slaughtered and traded. Scientists believe the virus that has killed more than 2,200 people came from an animal host. Beijing has reacted by issuing a temporary ban on the trade in all live animals.\n\nHowever, experts question how much any permanent regulatory tightening will be able to achieve. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, there is a widespread belief in China that consuming wild animals or animal parts, including tiger bones and rhino horns, can help strengthen the body and cure diseases. Adherents of traditional Chinese medicine believe eating civet cats, for instance, can help strengthen the body and improve a man's sexual function.\n\nGrowing disposable incomes over the past few decades have also resulted in increased demand for wild animals, which are seen as expensive delicacies.\n\nIn response to international concerns over endangered species as well as health concerns, Beijing has restricted their trade and in some cases banned hunting them. But it has also encouraged the wildlife farm industry, which has become a growth engine in the countryside.\n\nWildlife farms generated Rmb56bn in economic output in 2017, according to the China Forestry Yearbook, a fivefold jump from Rmb9.6bn 10 years earlier.\n\nYet critics say many farms have exploited a lack of official scrutiny to flout laws and increased their stock of restricted animals by capturing them in the wild. \"There is no way for wildlife farming to grow so fast in an organic manner,\" said a Beijing-based scholar and policy adviser who declined to be named.\n\nOn paper, China allows the farming and trading of 54 wild animals including kangaroos and bamboo rats. In reality, local governments have expanded the list to many other species.\n\nZhou Jinfeng, secretary-general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, a non-profit organisation, said several hundred wild species -- including many rare ones -- were up for sale. \"There is a general lack of regulation on wildlife farming and trade,\" said Mr Zhou.\n\nThe policy inertia could stem from potential conflicts of interest. Public records show dozens of retired forestry officials responsible for issuing wild animal farming licences also chair local wildlife conservation associations funded in part by farms.\n\n\"How do you expect the forestry authority to strictly enforce animal protection rules when it is financed by the business it regulates?\" said Mr Zhou.\n\nWhile it remains unclear which animal is to blame for the coronavirus outbreak, scientists believe the lack of oversight of China's wildlife industry has helped trigger the epidemic.\n\n\"Live wild animal markets, such as the huge wet markets in China\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009are ideal places for zoonotic virus emergence to occur,\" said Andrew Cunningham, deputy director of science at the Zoological Society of London, referring to conditions that originate in non-human animals.\n\nHowever, Chen Changfu, a professor at Central China Agricultural University, said wildlife farming would do no harm so long as there were greater controls over farming conditions.\n\n\"A carp fish in a well-kept pond is safer than its peer in a polluted river,\" said Mr Chen. \"The same is true with wild animals.\"\n\nOther academics prefer a ban on wildlife farming altogether, arguing that China lacks the capacity to conduct disease inspection. \"The inspection system must cover everything from hunting to farming to transportation to slaughtering,\" said one Beijing-based policy adviser. \"It is not economically viable.\"\n\nNonetheless, wildlife farmers are upbeat about their future. Yuan Jun, another civet cat farmer in Jiangxi, is confident his business will carry on despite the current ban on transportation and wildlife sales that has cost him Rmb1m since the end of January.\n\n\"Things will come back to normal when transportation resumes,\" said Mr Yuan.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

will cause its revenues to fall short in the current quarter, marking the second time in little over a year that weakness in China has forced the world's most valuable technology company to issue a financial warning.\n\nThe US consumer tech company said that it had assumed that work would return to normal in China after the new year holiday that ended on February 10. Instead, it said it was \"experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated\", leading it to warn that it will not meet the revenue guidance issued at the end of last month.\n\nApple's warning will send shockwaves across Wall Street, which had already started to look past the continuing coronavirus crisis. Following its earnings report at the end of January, Apple's shares have traded close to their all-time highs, valuing the company at more than $1.4tn as of Friday's close.\n\nThe shortfall partly reflects a manufacturing slowdown that will mean that \"worldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained,\" the company said.\n\nNone of the manufacturing plants run by its suppliers in China are in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. However, Apple said that other facilities, though reopened, were \"ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated.\"\n\nIt also said that store closures inside China had hit sales there, and that stores that were open were operating \"at reduced hours and with and very low customer traffic.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shock wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Conferences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F45882c50-51cd-11ea-a1ef-da1721a0541e?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "eventUri": "eng-5524918", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 64}, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 64, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1456702683", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-21", "time": "23:37:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-21T23:37:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-21T23:37:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/fc5d6188-5403-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1", "title": "Donald Trump shows the world who is the real 'Parasite'", "body": "I sometimes wonder if there is any moment when I am not thinking -- at least subconsciously -- about Donald Trump. It's one of the sadnesses of modern life.\n\nI find myself trying to rationalise his latest disregard for the rule of law, or pondering the ridiculously precise percentage that the US statistician Nate Silver has given Michael Bloomberg of winning the Democratic primary. My brain is like a laptop slowed down by malware perpetually running in the background.\n\nLast Friday, I found refuge. I went to watch the South Korean film Parasite. It was Valentine's Day. What could be more romantic than a thoughtful, Oscar-winning film, which, erm, descends into a murderous rampage in its final quarter. For two hours, I wasn't aware of Mr Trump; I wasn't even aware that I wasn't aware of him. When he pardoned various felons this week, I thought: we'll always have Parasite.\n\nIt didn't last. On Friday, I woke up to find that the president had an opinion about Parasite. Of course he did. If the Chinese government could shut down coronavirus as quickly as Mr Trump can shut down joy, the world would need many fewer hospital beds. My Valentine's evening had become just another skirmish in the culture war.\n\nMr Trump's complaint was that Parasite had won the Oscar for best picture. \"What the hell was that all about?\" he told a rally in Colorado. \"We got enough problems with South Korea with trade. On top of it, they give them the best movie of the year?\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Can we get like Gone with the Wind back please? Sunset Boulevard? So many great movies.\"\n\nA reminder: one Democratic candidate, Pete Buttigieg, bothered to learn Norwegian in order to read a novelist in his original language. Mr Trump won't bother to read subtitles. I'm sure he likes some foreign films, albeit the ones that don't have much dialogue and shouldn't be accessed from an office computer.\n\nMr Trump needs to be careful about imposing English language requirements in the US, because he would probably fail them. Nonetheless, it's nice to hear the president speak out against foreigners' reach into American institutions. Such a principle might be useful in, say, a presidential election.\n\nPerhaps he would have been happier if Parasite had come from North Korea, which he once claimed, \"under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse\". Then again, he used to like South Korea too. In 2017, Mr Trump visited Seoul and tweeted: \"Thank you to President Moon of South Korea for the beautiful welcoming ceremony. It will always be remembered.\" Update: it was not. Congratulations to the president for insulting one of the few countries where he is not already overwhelming unpopular.\n\nParasite's US distributor, Neon, had a simple yet beautiful comeback to Mr Trump's criticism: \"Understandable, he can't read.\" But there's a missed opportunity. What if the president could watch Parasite? What if he managed to get over what the film's director Bong Joon-ho has called \"the one-inch barrier of subtitles\"? As the director put it: \"We all live in the same country now: that of capitalism\" and \"we use only one language: the cinema\".\n\nThe film is a story of inequality, of how the poor are not less deserving or less ingenious than the rich. That should resonate with the president, who, asked to explain \"white trash\", reportedly once said, \"they're people just like me, only they're poor\".\n\nBut the movie also asks, who are society's real parasites -- the rich or the poor? That question should certainly resonate with Mr Trump, given the skewed tax cuts he championed. Alternatively, the president might just enjoy the massacre scenes. It doesn't matter what he keeps from Parasite, as long as it keeps him quiet for 130 minutes. Please, Mr President, MAGA -- Make America Go Away (for a bit).", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

stay at home and adopt a range of online remote-working tools for the first time.\n\nBut across the world in Silicon Valley, tech companies are doing the same thing -- not to escape infection, but to aid recruitment and keep staff happy.\n\nThe two trends -- separate, yet simultaneous -- are creating a boom for providers of technology that facilitate office-free collaboration, from messaging app Slack and videoconferencing provider Zoom in the US, to their newly bolstered rivals in China, including Alibaba's Dingtalk and Bytedance's Lark.\n\n\"Remote working is getting towards a tipping point,\" said Patrick McKenzie, a software engineer and marketer who has been a remote worker in Japan for 10 years, including the past three at San Francisco-based Stripe.\n\n\"For a while it was happening at a number of firms that were close to the experimental fringes of the tech community. We are increasingly seeing it at extremely savvy companies that have achieved a certain level of scale.\"\n\nDaniel Zhang, Alibaba's chief executive, said during last week's quarterly earnings call that the \"black swan event\" of Covid-19 presented \"near-term challenges\" to Alibaba's online sales platforms but also \"opportunities created by the forces of change\".\n\nJust as ecommerce was boosted by the Sars outbreak 17 years ago, he said, the coronavirus has triggered \"explosive growth\" for DingTalk, Alibaba's chat, videoconferencing and task management tool.\n\nAccording to App Annie, a mobile data and analytics provider, DingTalk was languishing outside China's top 250 iPhone apps as recently as January 25.\n\nNow, it has been top of Apple's App Store in China by daily downloads for most of February, beating all other apps and games in the region, App Annie said. Overall, Chinese downloads of business apps for iPhones in the first week of February more than doubled over the prior week to 7.4m, the researcher added.\n\nMeanwhile, the share prices of Zoom and Slack, which are both available in China, have risen by a fifth and a third, respectively, since the Chinese new year holiday.\n\nWithin Alibaba, Mr Zhang holds daily briefings with the heads of his various business units through DingTalk. It has been going so well that the company is considering doing more meetings online, even after the virus abates.\n\n\"The crisis is a very, very big challenge to the society but also\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009gives people a chance to try [a] new way of living and new way of working,\" Mr Zhang said.\n\nHis enthusiasm for a distributed workforce was echoed in San Francisco last week by Jack Dorsey, Twitter's globetrotting chief executive.\n\n\"As we look forward, we're reaching a talent pool that expects a lot more remote work, expects to work outside of California and outside of San Francisco, and we should be building our company around that,\" Mr Dorsey told investors and analysts on Twitter's quarterly earnings call.\n\nIt is not just San Francisco's eye-watering living costs that are driving the remote working trend. Distributed teams have been hailed as a solution to everything from work-life balance and employee diversity to climate change, by cutting commutes, and an economic downturn, by reducing rents.\n\nTech start-ups themselves are among the most enthusiastic adopters of these online collaboration technologies. When Ryan Hoover started Product Hunt, a site for discovering new apps and gadgets, in San Francisco in 2013, some of his earliest appointments were based in Europe or other parts of the US.\n\n\"We just realised, OK, we have these amazing people in the team, we are not going to ask them to move, everything seems to be working, and now we can open up the talent pool to anyone in the world,\" said Mr Hoover, who now runs Product Hunt's team of about 20 from Los Angeles.\n\nOne engineer joined the company while he was travelling around Asia. \"I didn't even know where he was -- and I didn't care as long as he was making the meetings and getting the work done,\" Mr Hoover said.\n\nBut he concedes that remote working has been easier to manage with a relatively small team. \"The bigger the company, the harder it is to change processes or adjust to the distributed team lifestyle. It is kind of an 'all or nothing' type of approach.\"\n\nStripe, the payments platform that is now the most valuable private US tech company, last year declared that its fifth \"engineering hub\" would be \"remote\" -- putting home workers on an equal footing with its offices in San Francisco, Seattle, Dublin and Singapore.\n\nSuch a structure \"puts a name on a practice and causes norms around it\", said Mr McKenzie, who helped to draw up Stripe's remote-working guidelines. \"Your company can have policies in place to measure the health of its remote workforce which it would not have if it had 100 people individually doing something that works for them.\"\n\nIt also helped shatter assumptions about office productivity. Stripe's management used to believe that certain types of product development benefited from \"synchronous, in person\" work, Mr McKenzie said, so the company expected to \"pay a large productivity tax for [employees] doing that remotely\".\n\nBut now that remote working has been formalised, internal surveys and appraisals suggest that \"our level of satisfaction with engineers is actually marginally higher\" when they operate outside one of its physical hubs than for staff within its own offices, Mr McKenzie said.\n\nWorkers in China have had little time to weigh up the costs and benefits of remote working before circumstances foisted it upon them.\n\nDenise Chen is stuck in her hometown of Xiangyang in Hubei, the province at the centre of the outbreak which has been quarantined off from the rest of China. \"Since January 25 I haven't left my apartment block more than once or twice,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm disciplined and get my deliverables in, so it hasn't been a problem so far,\" she added.\n\nBut a software engineer at one of Beijing's largest tech companies, who has worked at home for the past two weeks, estimated that he had only been 80 per cent as efficient as he is in the office.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type":

"title": "China app downloads surge due to coronavirus outbreak", "body": "Smartphone users in China downloaded a record number of games and other apps as the deadly coronavirus confined tens of millions of people to their homes, in a boost to the $150bn global games industry.\n\nMore than 222m downloads were made in China through Apple's online store in the week starting February 2, according to data provided to the Financial Times by analytics provider AppAnnie.\n\nAverage weekly downloads of apps during the first two weeks of February jumped 40 per cent compared with the average for the whole of 2019, the statistics showed.\n\nBoth timeframes coincided with an acceleration in the viral outbreak, which has killed more than 2,000 people.\n\n\"This year downloads continued to grow well into the weeks following the lunar new year holidays as millions of workers and students leveraged mobile apps to seek alternative methods to resume daily activities remotely,\" AppAnnie analysts said in their report. Normally, a jump in game downloads over lunar new year falls off sharply in the following weeks.\n\nDownloads of education apps in February spiked due the spread of the virus, known as Covid-19, running at twice the average rate for all of 2019. Schools in many large Chinese cities have remained closed since the lunar new year holiday and are not expected to reopen for weeks.\n\nAppAnnie's numbers do not show an equivalent spike for game or education downloads in either Japan or South Korea.\n\nThe prospect of more smartphone purchases by homebound Chinese has already led to a surge in listed games makers. Shares in Tencent, China's largest mobile games provider, are at a 20-month high. The company's market capitalisation is now above $500bn.\n\nShares in New Oriental Education, which provides online education in China, have jumped 17 per cent this year.\n\n\"No one expected that this kind of epidemic could grow so fast, and that created an opportunity for these gaming companies,\" said Shawn Yang, Shenzhen-based managing director at Blue Lotus Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank.\n\n\"The more time players spend 'in-game' the more likely they are to monetise,\" said Daniel Ahmad, an analyst at Niko Partners, a consultancy, referring to paying for extra features in games that are free to download and play.\n\nRevenue from games in China during the lunar new year holiday rose 12 per cent compared with the previous year, Mr Ahmad said, with that growth continuing into subsequent weeks as businesses in many cities remained closed.\n\nSome parts of the gaming industry have been hit as the virus has shuttered many workplaces and factories in China. That has affected Sony and Nintendo, which depend on the country for their hardware supply chains.\n\nShares in Nintendo, which relies on hardware sales for over half its revenues, have dropped almost 9 per cent this year on concerns that factory shutdowns will hurt production of its Switch console.\n\nAsia including Japan accounts for half of all global spending on mobile games, said David Gibson, a Tokyo-based gaming analyst at Astris Advisory. He anticipates growing demand for the Switch in China, where the console recently launched.\n\nHe added that the immediate impact of disruption to supply chains may not be serious, given that February and March are traditionally quiet periods for console manufacturing. If disruption continues, Mr Gibson said, Sony's planned launch of its PlayStation 5 console in November could be \"severely constrained\".", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

"title": "Bankruptcy risks rise for US shale", "body": "Bankruptcy risks in the US shale sector are rising, with weak oil prices and tightening access to credit worsening the outlook for some producers just as a \"staggering\" $86bn in debt maturities start to come due.\n\nSpeculative-grade, or subinvestment, debt makes up more than 60 per cent of the total to be repaid between now and 2024, \"implying a higher degree of default risk for the industry\", said Moody's, the rating agency, in a report on Wednesday.\n\nSpeculative-grade maturities will peak in 2022, dwarfing investment-grade maturities by almost two to one that year, Moody's said.\n\nBut weakening oil and gas prices, and bearish market sentiment -- caused by expectations of a global oil-supply overhang in the first half of 2020 -- will hurt producers' efforts to raise more money this year, in turn threatening to starve them of capital to invest in production to keep cash flow intact, said analysts.\n\nCompanies already rated at subinvestment level and those focused on natural gas are especially exposed and will face investors that have developed a \"risk aversion\" to the sector, said the Moody's report.\n\nNatural gas-focused Antero Resources, EQT and Chesapeake, which between them hold debt of more than $5bn due to mature between now and 2024, were among 12 companies Moody's said would face a \"particularly challenging\" refinancing outlook.\n\n\"While these companies have already taken some measures to address maturities, more needs to be done,\" said Moody's.\n\nIn January, the average interest rate paid by shale producers for corporate debt rated by Moody's as B3, or highly speculative, was 400-500 basis points above the average for B3 rated debt across all sectors, said Sajjad Alam, the lead author of the Moody's report.\n\nOil prices have fallen more than 15 per cent since early January, reflecting worries about global oversupply that have been exacerbated by the weakness of Chinese demand since the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, front-month US natural gas prices plunged to their lowest February close in 20 years last week, amid unseasonably warm weather.\n\nBut US shale producers are also victims of their own longer-term success. Natural gas output in the Lower 48 states of the contiguous US has almost doubled since 2005 and crude oil production has leapt almost 160 per cent since 2008.\n\nUS natural gas production, which hit a record high in 2019, would rise by another 2 per cent this year, according to a forecast last week by the Energy Information Administration, a division of the Department of Energy. Crude oil production would increase almost 8 per cent, to 13.2m barrels a day, it said.\n\nThat already represents a slowing of recent annual growth rates, but the looming credit crunch and increased cost of capital for indebted producers, alongside persistent weakness in oil and gas prices, could further damp production growth expectations, said analysts.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType":

fashion buyers from Europe's top fashion shows this month as the luxury industry faces its biggest threat since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nChina has become all-important to the global luxury and fashion industries as a driver of sales and a core manufacturing hub. Chinese consumers accounted for roughly 40 per cent of the \u20ac281bn spent on luxury goods globally last year, according to Jefferies, but drove 80 per cent of the growth, powering sales increases at companies such as LVMH and Kering.\n\nThe outbreak has also started to disrupt supply chains for more mid-market apparel, with retailers and fashion brands expressing concern about whether Chinese factories will be able to deliver autumn-winter collections as planned.\n\nCompanies such as LVMH, Kering and Richemont are less vulnerable because they are not as reliant on China for manufacturing as those apparel makers, or industries that have integrated global supply chains like cars or smartphones.\n\nBut Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at Bernstein, said luxury sales in the first quarter could be \"heavily impacted\" and considered it possible that revenues would fall by \"low to mid-teens\" digits.\n\n\"If all goes well, then maybe the second half will come roaring back,\" he added. \"But for now we need to take into account that the situation is really very negative when it comes to Chinese demand globally.\"\n\nUS-listed luxury companies are also dependent on China. Coach and Kate Spade owner Tapestry has been increasing revenues in China about three times faster than the group overall and Tiffany almost twice as fast, according to a report from Moody's on Thursday.\n\nChina is a major producer of cotton, fabrics and silk, and its factories churn out everything from coats to swimsuits for fashion brands from Hennes & Mauritz and Next of the UK to higher-end designers such as Tory Burch.\n\nFive Chinese designers have cancelled fashion shows scheduled for Paris Fashion Week next week, and Chanel and Prada postponed separate events planned for May in China.\n\nThe National Chamber for Italian Fashion said an \"optimistic\" estimate would be for Italian exports to fall by a minimum of \u20ac100m in the first quarter and \u20ac230m \"in the event of a prolonged crisis\" for the first half of the year.\n\nTo keep Chinese buyers engaged, Kering's Gucci brand live-streamed the catwalk show for its autumn-winter women's collection in Milan, using Weibo, one of China's biggest social media platforms.\n\nBefore the event, viewers were treated to a bird's-eye view of the area where models were being made up. Once it began, they could see voluminous ruffled dresses and military-inspired coats in all their splendour.\n\nGucci, Kering's biggest and most profitable brand, launched the Weibo channel last year to win over Chinese consumers, who now buy more luxury goods than Europeans or Americans. Rivals such as LVMH and Chanel and the organisers of Fashion Week in Milan and Paris scrambled to set up similar live feeds.\n\nLuxury goods groups have activated contingency plans that include closing stores and offices in China, scaling back product launches and advertising, and clamping down on staff expenses globally. Some have instituted hiring freezes.\n\nWith many workplaces and stores in China still shut, there is a sombre mood that does not lend itself to conspicuous consumption. One executive described eerie scenes of Shanghai's luxury shopping mall Plaza 66 being deserted on Valentine's Day. The doors to Cartier and Tiffany's were also closed.\n\n\"We are now, brand by brand, reallocating that inventory to other regions in the world so that we are not too heavy in stock in China,\" Kering chief executive Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault told a press conference last week. He described the environment in China as \"changed significantly\" and said it remained difficult to predict how it would evolve.\n\nThe crisis comes as the luxury sector is trading near all-time highs of about 26 times forward price-to-earnings, according to Morningstar, after years of strong growth driven in large part by Chinese consumers.\n\nMid-market fashion brands have more supply chain exposure to China than their luxury peers. Analysts said that while rising labour costs mean China is not as important a manufacturer as it used to be, it is still a major source of fabrics for garment makers in places such as Bangladesh and Vietnam.\n\nFor retailers, which follow a traditional two-season model with long lead times, most stock for spring and summer will already have been dispatched before the virus hit, and will be en route to distribution centres. The bigger issue is whether manufacturing and dispatch of autumn-winter stock will be disrupted by a delayed return to work in China after the lunar new year.\n\n\"Our discussions with companies suggest factories remaining closed beyond the end of February may start to impact stock availability,\" said UBS analyst Olivia Townsend.\n\nIn the UK, Next told analysts recently that it had about \u00a320m of inventory at risk in China. Delayed delivery to retailers means the clothes arrive too late for the intended season and must then be marked down to sell.\n\nFast-fashion operators such as H&M and Inditex's Zara usually have a diverse supply base located in north Africa and Turkey, and their ability to shift volumes from one supplier to another provides some insulation against the disruption in China.\n\nEdited, a London-based retail data analytics start-up, found shipments of mass-market clothing from China to the US and UK have fallen 3.5 per cent this year.\n\nGary Wassner, whose New York-based company Hilldun Corporation provides supply-chain finance to fashion brands and designers that manufacture in China, said he was hearing of disruptions.\n\n\"We have already received new schedules of delivery from some factories with delayed ship dates out of China,\" he said. \"In some cases, this will mean the designers will miss their delivery deadlines with retailers, so they may have to fly product in instead of boat it in.\"\n\nHe added that the industry was worried: \"The insecurity is mounting both for factory owners in China and the brands on this side of the world.\"", "source": {"uri":

of its holdings of 30-year US Treasury bonds, after concluding that current low yields were \"not anywhere close to fundamentally correct\".\n\nRick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, who oversees the group's $2.3tn bond portfolio, told the Financial Times that it pared down its exposure to long-dated US Treasuries as the yield fell below 1.9 per cent for the first time ever.\n\nIntensifying concern over the spread of coronavirus outside China sent investors rushing to safe assets on Friday, while weak data on the US economy further stoked the rally in Treasuries.\n\n\"[Rates] at these levels are not anywhere close to fundamentally correct,\" Mr Rieder told the FT. \"With bad news, everyone goes one way. You want to try to be on the other side of it.\"\n\nThe 30-year Treasury yield has fallen 47 basis points since the start of the year, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond has slipped by a similar amount, to below 1.5 per cent.\n\nYields on longer-dated debt have fallen faster than those on shorter-dated notes, prompting an inversion of the yield curve that investors fear is a signal of impending recession.\n\nMr Rieder did not predict a dramatic reversal, however, and described BlackRock's actions as \"taking chips off the table\" rather than a more dramatic exit from long-term Treasuries.\n\n\"Markets can stay fundamentally impure for much longer than people think,\" he cautioned.\n\nThe Treasury market rally has intensified as signs of the economic fallout from the coronavirus has grown in recent weeks. The virus has claimed more than 2,200 lives, infected over 76,000 and disrupted supply chains across the world.\n\nExpectations for US monetary policy have shifted as a result, and markets are pricing in at least one quarter-point reduction in US interest rates in the second half of the year, according to futures prices compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMr Rieder said he did not agree, since most economic data out of the US remains solid, and the Federal Reserve has signalled its intention to keep rates at current levels throughout 2020. \"The Fed wants to stay on hold and see where things go,\" he said.\n\nThe global fixed income business overseen by Mr Rieder accounts for $2.3tn of BlackRock's $7.4tn in assets under management.\n\nThe largest single fund managed by Mr Rieder, the $35bn BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities, has returned 1.6 per cent so far this year, outpacing its peers by 0.9 per cent, according to Morningstar.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news",

"title": "Coronavirus provides an opportunity for Chinese tech companies", "body": "As the coronavirus crisis in China escalated, I began to notice glowing news reports about the latest technological innovation to fight the outbreak: contactless delivery.\n\nMcDonald's, Starbucks, KFC, Pizza Hut and a string of Chinese delivery companies were trialling apparently cutting-edge technology. Intrigued by the buzz, I tried it. I logged on to Meituan, my Chinese food delivery app of choice, ordered \"contactless delivery\" dumplings and waited. Within an hour, my groundbreaking online shopping experience was complete: the courier left my dinner at the entrance to my apartment.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak is proving a marketing boon for Chinese tech companies with products they can connect to fighting the virus -- however tenuous that connection may be.\n\nAn industry body affiliated with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has identified a list of over 60 companies that claim to provide tech solutions to the coronavirus problem.\n\nAre you feeling anxious because of the virus? So am I. Never fear, emotion recognition is here. A company in Shanghai says it can assess your emotional state through a 60 second video analysis of your \"skin, eyeballs, corners of your mouth, eyelids and bodily vibrations\". Once the emotion recognition discovers abnormal levels of aggression or stress, please seek the appropriate psychological help.\n\nIf by some chance the emotion recognition test fails, there is always crowd recognition. Police across the country are using big data, provided by a company on the list called Beiyang, to identify individuals (who may or may not have coronavirus) in crowds. Beiyang claims its technology has led to a 22 per cent drop in calls to China's emergency hotline, a 36 per cent drop in muggings and 40 per cent fewer burglaries.\n\nIf you have been identified as a coronavirus patient through emotion and crowd recognition, then Yelink, a Shenzhen-based company, will provide you with all the technology -- the internet of things, more big data, cloud computing -- to effectively self-quarantine at home.\n\nYour temperature, heart beat and blood oxygen levels will be tracked through bluetooth thermometers and wristbands, which feed this data to the government's \"public health cloud\" to be analysed. The company will even throw in a lock for your front door which will only unlock if the company's smartphone app deems you healthy. Don't try forcing the door open -- the police will be alerted.\n\nWhile in quarantine, you can pass the time playing on your phone. Just do not post anything politically sensitive. If you do, UiBot, a smart robotics company, will find out as it conducts automatic keyword searches on WeChat, the messaging app that millions of Chinese use every day and which forms the bedrock of the country's internet.\n\nThese keyword searches have been so effective that China's internet censors have blocked students across the country -- currently stuck at home because of the virus -- from taking online classes in politics, modern history and Chinese literature because of \"sensitive\" content -- or, in the case of biology, \"pornographic\" content.\n\nIn fairness to the industry body's carefully curated coronavirus solutions list, it includes some surveillance tech which seems genuinely helpful: increased monitoring of the health of nursing care residents who may be overlooked as medical resources are redirected towards coping with the coronavirus outbreak; AI temperature checks for crowds; and, digital platforms to more transparently co-ordinate the procurement and logistics of medical supplies.\n\nHow much of this technology is here to stay when the coronavirus outbreak ends? It is likely that governments and businesses that have invested in upgrading their surveillance tech won't unwind it once the crisis is over. I'm going to bet that \"contactless delivery\" will not disappear either: those dumplings I order online will continue to be delivered straight to my doorstep.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com",

steps\" were needed to prevent a growing crisis in the country's China-reliant economy, as the fallout from the deadly coronavirus outbreak reverberated across the globe.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in called for \"all possible measures\" to support South Korea's economy, a day after analysts said Japan was facing a technical recession as the coronavirus disrupts regional supply chains and exports.\n\n\"We should take every possible measure we can think of\" to support the economy, Mr Moon told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. \"The current situation is more serious than we thought\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we need to take emergency steps in this time of emergency.\"\n\nUnderlining the growing impact from the virus, Apple, the world's most valuable technology company whose iPhone is built in China, admitted revenues would be lower than forecast because disruption from the virus had \"constrained\" production.\n\nThe biggest exporters in South Korea, such as Hyundai Motor, have also been badly hit by the delayed shipments of parts from China. The country buys about a quarter of South Korea's exports.\n\nThe growing economic fallout has prompted leading Asian economies to announce stimulus and monetary measures to counter the slowdown, with China's central bank this week lowering a benchmark lending rate.\n\nSouth Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy, has also already announced a Won420bn ($356m) emergency plan to offer loans to struggling airlines, shipping companies, travel agencies and retailers facing a virus-related liquidity crunch.\n\nSingapore is expected to unveil a fiscal stimulus to offset the fallout from the virus when it announces its budget later on Tuesday. The city-state slashed its GDP growth forecast to -0.5 to 1.5 per cent, down from 0.5 to 2.5 per cent.\n\nPrakash Sakpal, economist at ING, said in a note to clients that the package was likely to include personal and corporate income tax relief as well as relief measures for the retail and tourism sectors.\n\nSingapore is particularly vulnerable to the virus as a small, open economy whose tourism sector is heavily reliant on Chinese visitors. The Singapore tourism board last week said it expected visitor arrivals in 2020 to fall up by to 30 per cent.\n\nJapan's economy shrank at an annualised rate of more than 6 per cent in the final three-months of 2019 following a rise in the country's consumption tax. This worse than expected performance was before the coronavirus outbreak shut down tourism from China and disrupted supply chains for Japanese companies. A second consecutive quarter of falling output, which many analysts now believe is likely, would plunge Japan's economy into recession.\n\nEconomists expected China's growth rate to cool sharply in the first quarter of this year due to the virus -- although the extent of the likely slowdown was under debate.\n\nGoldman Sachs, which tracks various measures to gauge the impact, said on Tuesday that coal consumption by major electricity producers was a third lower in the first 16 days of February than \"normal seasonality would suggest\".\n\nChina said there had been 98 new deaths from the coronavirus as of Monday, taking the total number killed to 1,868. There were 1,886 new cases, taking the total to 72,436, according to the National Health Commission. Both the number of deaths and of new cases were lower than the previous day.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

all-time low on Friday as intensifying fears over the spread of coronavirus outside China sent investors rushing to safe assets and prompted fresh warnings from global health officials.\n\nThe yield on long-dated US Treasuries dipped below 1.9 per cent amid a global bond rally, with investors betting that the economic impact of the virus could drive the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.\n\n\"We are now expecting the coronavirus to have a longer impact on global growth,\" said Dickie Hodges, a portfolio manager at Nomura Asset Management, who has a quarter of his fund in US government bonds. \"The US is one of the few places that has room to cut rates, and I think they will cut at least twice this year. In that environment you want to own Treasuries.\"\n\nThe flight to safety came as South Korea imposed emergency restrictions on one of its biggest cities and a nearby town, the latest in a series of increasingly severe measures by governments struggling to contain the deadly coronavirus.\n\nAfter Seoul officials asked residents of Daegu, the country's fourth-biggest city, to stay confined to their homes, the World Health Organization sounded a warning over sharp increases in infections in South Korea and Iran. It also flagged concerns over Shandong province in eastern China despite a declining number of cases in Hubei, the centre of the outbreak.\n\n\"We are still in a phase where containment is possible but with a narrowing window of opportunity,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO.\n\nThe respiratory illness, which experts believe originated from Wuhan in December last year, has now killed more than 2,240 people. Globally nearly 77,000 cases have been confirmed, with China accounting for more than 75,000.\n\nSeoul on Friday reported 100 new cases of the Covid-19 virus, including 90 cases traced to a religious sect in Daegu, making South Korea the worst-hit country outside China. Daegu authorities said more than 400 church members of 3,000 surveyed in the city were showing symptoms. And experts said more infections were likely among the group's followers.\n\nIran's health ministry said on Friday that two more Iranians had died after being infected, taking the number of fatalities in the country to four.\n\nThe worldwide outbreak has raised concerns of a deepening hit to consumer spending and worsening supply chain disruptions, darkening the outlook for multinationals and encompassing industries from airlines to shipping and smartphones to fashion.\n\nIn China, senior Chinese Communist party leaders on Friday urged officials to help workers travel back to their places of employment, as Beijing ramps up efforts to bring the economy back to life after weeks of shutdown due to the virus.\n\nAfter a meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping, officials said priority had to be given to businesses playing an important role in global supply chains and that vital exporting enterprises had to be supported, state media reported.\n\nHowever, most companies globally have little capacity to protect themselves other than to shelve growth plans, said Giovanni di Lieto, lecturer in international business from Australia's Monash University. \"No replacement for China is in sight,\" he said.\n\nInvestors are also wary of a looming commodities sell-off once markets price in the disruption to supply chains caused by the coronavirus.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts said the virus had created the \"largest disruption to commodity-related activity\" since the financial crisis yet commodity prices have risen on hopes of stimulus.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news",

struggling to return to full production after China's new year holiday because of restrictions on worker movement caused by the coronavirus, adding to concerns that the outbreak will have a lasting effect on the US company.\n\nContract manufacturer Foxconn assembles many of Apple's newest iPhones at a huge factory complex at Zhengzhou in China's Henan province. At full production, more than 200,000 workers put together iPhones on its assembly lines.\n\nBut Foxconn faces multiple challenges to staffing the factory, which has partially resumed production as workers trickle back from an extended holiday break. On Tuesday, the unit responsible for iPhone production stopped accepting workers from outside the city, pointing to issues in housing workers in need of quarantine.\n\n\"In response to government epidemic control requirements to prioritise prevention and safely resume work, and at the same time improve the quality of our worker reception services\" non-Zhengzhou workers had to temporarily hold off reporting for work, a notice seen by the Financial Times said.\n\nLocal authorities are particularly concerned that a large influx of workers returning from around the region could rapidly spread the virus. Companies had to \"strictly protect against the virus entering and spreading\" in the workplace, Henan provincial officials said on Monday, instructing local health commissions to \"step up oversight of workplace virus-control measures\".\n\nFaced with municipal policies such as a required quarantine period for returning workers, the Zhengzhou plant has struggled to muster its full workforce. The Zhengzhou city government requires returning workers to self-quarantine for between seven and 14 days.\n\nFoxconn had put returning workers in self-quarantine of one person per room at its factory dormitories, workers said. The rooms, which usually pack in eight workers, had quickly filled, causing Foxconn to halt the return of additional staff, explained a Zhengzhou-based factory recruiter, who asked not to be named.\n\n\"They don't have enough room,\" the recruiter said, adding that workers could now sign up and wait for quarantine availability.\n\nThe news comes as Apple announced a revenue warning due in part to its \"temporarily constrained\" smartphone supply.\n\nThe company told investors on Monday that its factories in China were \"ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated\" and that \"iPhone supply shortages will temporarily affect revenues worldwide\". The company has perfected a just-in-time supply chain that cuts costs but makes it vulnerable to unforeseen disruptions.\n\nAnalysts were divided over how severely the disruption would damage business beyond the short-term. Manish Nigam, head of Asian technology research at Credit Suisse, forecasts a 15 per cent shortfall in tech production in the first quarter, based on the assumption that a full month of production will be lost but partially offset by overtime later in March.\n\nMia Huang, an analyst at Taipei-based industry research company TrendForce, said: \"The question raising the most concern is whether the launch date and initial shipments of the iPhone SE2, also known as iPhone 9, which was about to be launched, will be affected. For now, we are lowering our forecast for iPhone production in the first quarter by 10 per cent from 45m to 41m [units].\"\n\nOthers believe the fallout will last much longer. \"The impact starts looking bigger and bigger, and in the coming weeks, the impact will grow,\" said Bill Lu, head of Asian semiconductor research at UBS, noting component shortages were the next threat. \"Inventory is low in the smartphone supply chain,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":
