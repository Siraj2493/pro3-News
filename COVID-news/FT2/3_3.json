Perhaps the biggest crisis of our generation. The decisions people and governments take in the next few weeks will probably shape the world for years to come. They will shape not just our healthcare systems but also our economy, politics and culture. We must act quickly and decisively. We should also take into account the long-term consequences of our actions. When choosing between alternatives, we should ask ourselves not only how to overcome the immediate threat, but also what kind of world we will inhabit once the storm passes. Yes, the storm will pass, humankind will survive, most of us will still be alive -- but we will inhabit a different world.\n\nMany short-term emergency measures will become a fixture of life. That is the nature of emergencies. They fast-forward historical processes. Decisions that in normal times could take years of deliberation are passed in a matter of hours. Immature and even dangerous technologies are pressed into service, because the risks of doing nothing are bigger. Entire countries serve as guinea-pigs in large-scale social experiments. What happens when everybody works from home and communicates only at a distance? What happens when entire schools and universities go online? In normal times, governments, businesses and educational boards would never agree to conduct such experiments. But these aren't normal times.\n\nIn this time of crisis, we face two particularly important choices. The first is between totalitarian surveillance and citizen empowerment. The second is between nationalist isolation and global solidarity.\n\nIn order to stop the epidemic, entire populations need to comply with certain guidelines. There are two main ways of achieving this. One method is for the government to monitor people, and punish those who break the rules. Today, for the first time in human history, technology makes it possible to monitor everyone all the time. Fifty years ago, the KGB couldn't follow 240m Soviet citizens 24 hours a day, nor could the KGB hope to effectively process all the information gathered. The KGB relied on human agents and analysts, and it just couldn't place a human agent to follow every citizen. But now governments can rely on ubiquitous sensors and powerful algorithms instead of flesh-and-blood spooks.\n\nIn their battle against the coronavirus epidemic several governments have already deployed the new surveillance tools. The most notable case is China. By closely monitoring people's smartphones, making use of hundreds of millions of face-recognising cameras, and obliging people to check and report their body temperature and medical condition, the Chinese authorities can not only quickly identify suspected coronavirus carriers, but also track their movements and identify anyone they came into contact with. A range of mobile apps warn citizens about their proximity to infected patients.\n\nThis kind of technology is not limited to east Asia. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel recently authorised the Israel Security Agency to deploy surveillance technology normally reserved for battling terrorists to track coronavirus patients. When the relevant parliamentary subcommittee refused to authorise the measure, Netanyahu rammed it through with an \"emergency decree\".\n\nYou might argue that there is nothing new about all this. In recent years both governments and corporations have been using ever more sophisticated technologies to track, monitor and manipulate people. Yet if we are not careful, the epidemic might nevertheless mark an important watershed in the history of surveillance. Not only because it might normalise the deployment of mass surveillance tools in countries that have so far rejected them, but even more so because it signifies a dramatic transition from \"over the skin\" to \"under the skin\" surveillance.\n\nHitherto, when your finger touched the screen of your smartphone and clicked on a link, the government wanted to know what exactly your finger was clicking on. But with coronavirus, the focus of interest shifts. Now the government wants to know the temperature of your finger and the blood-pressure under its skin.\n\nOne of the problems we face in working out where we stand on surveillance is that none of us know exactly how we are being surveilled, and what the coming years might bring. Surveillance technology is developing at breakneck speed, and what seemed science-fiction 10 years ago is today old news. As a thought experiment, consider a hypothetical government that demands that every citizen wears a biometric bracelet that monitors body temperature and heart-rate 24 hours a day. The resulting data is hoarded and analysed by government algorithms. The algorithms will know that you are sick even before you know it, and they will also know where you have been, and who you have met. The chains of infection could be drastically shortened, and even cut altogether. Such a system could arguably stop the epidemic in its tracks within days. Sounds wonderful, right?\n\nThe downside is, of course, that this would give legitimacy to a terrifying new surveillance system. If you know, for example, that I clicked on a Fox News link rather than a CNN link, that can teach you something about my political views and perhaps even my personality. But if you can monitor what happens to my body temperature, blood pressure and heart-rate as I watch the video clip, you can learn what makes me laugh, what makes me cry, and what makes me really, really angry.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that anger, joy, boredom and love are biological phenomena just like fever and a cough. The same technology that identifies coughs could also identify laughs. If corporations and governments start harvesting our biometric data en masse, they can get to know us far better than we know ourselves, and they can then not just predict our feelings but also manipulate our feelings and sell us anything they want -- be it a product or a politician. Biometric monitoring would make Cambridge Analytica's data hacking tactics look like something from the Stone Age. Imagine North Korea in 2030, when every citizen has to wear a biometric bracelet 24 hours a day. If you listen to a speech by the Great Leader and the bracelet picks up the tell-tale signs of anger, you are done for.\n\nYou could, of course, make the case for biometric surveillance as a temporary measure taken during a state of emergency. It would go away once the emergency is over. But temporary measures have a nasty habit of outlasting emergencies, especially as there is always a new emergency lurking on the horizon. My home country of Israel, for example, declared a state of emergency during its 1948 War of Independence, which justified a range of temporary measures from press censorship and land confiscation to special regulations for making pudding (I kid you not). The War of Independence has long been won, but Israel never declared the emergency over, and has failed to abolish many of the \"temporary\" measures of 1948 (the emergency pudding decree was mercifully abolished in 2011).\n\nEven when infections from coronavirus are down to zero, some data-hungry governments could argue they needed to keep the biometric surveillance systems in place because they fear a second wave of coronavirus, or because there is a new Ebola strain evolving in central Africa, or because\u200a.\u200a.\u200a.\u200ayou get the idea. A big battle has been raging in recent years over our privacy. The coronavirus crisis could be the battle's tipping point. For when people are given a choice between privacy and health, they will usually choose health.\n\nAsking people to choose between privacy and health is, in fact, the very root of the problem. Because this is a false choice. We can and should enjoy both privacy and health. We can choose to protect our health and stop the coronavirus epidemic not by instituting totalitarian surveillance regimes, but rather by empowering citizens. In recent weeks, some of the most successful efforts to contain the coronavirus epidemic were orchestrated by South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. While these countries have made some use of tracking applications, they have relied far more on extensive testing, on honest reporting, and on the willing co-operation of a well-informed public.\n\nCentralised monitoring and harsh punishments aren't the only way to make people comply with beneficial guidelines. When people are told the scientific facts, and when people trust public authorities to tell them these facts, citizens can do the right thing even without a Big Brother watching over their shoulders. A self-motivated and well-informed population is usually far more powerful and effective than a policed, ignorant population.\n\nConsider, for example, washing your hands with soap. This has been one of the greatest advances ever in human hygiene. This simple action saves millions of lives every year. While we take it for granted, it was only in the 19th century that scientists discovered the importance of washing hands with soap. Previously, even doctors and nurses proceeded from one surgical operation to the next without washing their hands. Today billions of people daily wash their hands, not because they are afraid of the soap police, but rather because they understand the facts. I wash my hands with soap because I have heard of viruses and bacteria, I understand that these tiny organisms cause diseases, and I know that soap can remove them.\n\nBut to achieve such a level of compliance and co-operation, you need trust. People need to trust science, to trust public authorities, and to trust the media. Over the past few years, irresponsible politicians have deliberately undermined trust in science, in public authorities and in the media. Now these same irresponsible politicians might be tempted to take the high road to authoritarianism, arguing that you just cannot trust the public to do the right thing.\n\nNormally, trust that has been eroded for years cannot be rebuilt overnight. But these are not normal times. In a moment of crisis, minds too can change quickly. You can have bitter arguments with your siblings for years, but when some emergency occurs, you suddenly discover a hidden reservoir of trust and amity, and you rush to help one another. Instead of building a surveillance regime, it is not too late to rebuild people's trust in science, in public authorities and in the media. We should definitely make use of new technologies too, but these technologies should empower citizens. I am all in favour of monitoring my body temperature and blood pressure, but that data should not be used to create an all-powerful government. Rather, that data should enable me to make more informed personal choices, and also to hold government accountable for its decisions.\n\nIf I could track my own medical condition 24 hours a day, I would learn not only whether I have become a health hazard to other people, but also which habits contribute to my health. And if I could access and analyse reliable statistics on the spread of coronavirus, I would be able to judge whether the government is telling me the truth and whether it is adopting the right policies to combat the epidemic. Whenever people talk about surveillance, remember that the same surveillance technology can usually be used not only by governments to monitor individuals -- but also by individuals to monitor governments.\n\nThe coronavirus epidemic is thus a major test of citizenship. In the days ahead, each one of us should choose to trust scientific data and healthcare experts over unfounded conspiracy theories and self-serving politicians. If we fail to make the right choice, we might find ourselves signing away our most precious freedoms, thinking that this is the only way to safeguard our health\n\nThe second important choice we confront is between nationalist isolation and global solidarity. Both the epidemic itself and the resulting economic crisis are global problems. They can be solved effectively only by global co-operation.\n\nFirst and foremost, in order to defeat the virus we need to share information globally. That's the big advantage of humans over viruses. A coronavirus in China and a coronavirus in the US cannot swap tips about how to infect humans. But China can teach the US many valuable lessons about coronavirus and how to deal with it. What an Italian doctor discovers in Milan in the early morning might well save lives in Tehran by evening. When the UK government hesitates between several policies, it can get advice from the Koreans who have already faced a similar dilemma a month ago. But for this to happen, we need a spirit of global co-operation and trust.\n\nCountries should be willing to share information openly and humbly seek advice, and should be able to trust the data and the insights they receive. We also need a global effort to produce and distribute medical equipment, most notably testing kits and respiratory machines. Instead of every country trying to do it locally and hoarding whatever equipment it can get, a co-ordinated global effort could greatly accelerate production and make sure life-saving equipment is distributed more fairly. Just as countries nationalise key industries during a war, the human war against coronavirus may require us to \"humanise\" the crucial production lines. A rich country with few coronavirus cases should be willing to send precious equipment to a poorer country with many cases, trusting that if and when it subsequently needs help, other countries will come to its assistance.\n\nWe might consider a similar global effort to pool medical personnel. Countries currently less affected could send medical staff to the worst-hit regions of the world, both in order to help them in their hour of need, and in order to gain valuable experience. If later on the focus of the epidemic shifts, help could start flowing in the opposite direction.\n\nGlobal co-operation is vitally needed on the economic front too. Given the global nature of the economy and of supply chains, if each government does its own thing in complete disregard of the others, the result will be chaos and a deepening crisis. We need a global plan of action, and we need it fast.\n\nAnother requirement is reaching a global agreement on travel. Suspending all international travel for months will cause tremendous hardships, and hamper the war against coronavirus. Countries need to co-operate in order to allow at least a trickle of essential travellers to continue crossing borders: scientists, doctors, journalists, politicians, businesspeople. This can be done by reaching a global agreement on the pre-screening of travellers by their home country. If you know that only carefully screened travellers were allowed on a plane, you would be more willing to accept them into your country.\n\nUnfortunately, at present countries hardly do any of these things. A collective paralysis has gripped the international community. There seem to be no adults in the room. One would have expected to see already weeks ago an emergency meeting of global leaders to come up with a common plan of action. The G7 leaders managed to organise a videoconference only this week, and it did not result in any such plan.\n\nIn previous global crises -- such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2014 Ebola epidemic -- the US assumed the role of global leader. But the current US administration has abdicated the job of leader. It has made it very clear that it cares about the greatness of America far more than about the future of humanity.\n\nThis administration has abandoned even its closest allies. When it banned all travel from the EU, it didn't bother to give the EU so much as an advance notice -- let alone consult with the EU about that drastic measure. It has scandalised Germany by allegedly offering $1bn to a German pharmaceutical company to buy monopoly rights to a new Covid-19 vaccine. Even if the current administration eventually changes tack and comes up with a global plan of action, few would follow a leader who never takes responsibility, who never admits mistakes, and who routinely takes all the credit for himself while leaving all the blame to others.\n\nIf the void left by the US isn't filled by other countries, not only will it be much harder to stop the current epidemic, but its legacy will continue to poison international relations for years to come. Yet every crisis is also an opportunity. We must hope that the current epidemic will help humankind realise the acute danger posed by global disunity.\n\nHumanity needs to make a choice. Will we travel down the route of disunity, or will we adopt the path of global solidarity? If we choose disunity, this will not only prolong the crisis, but will probably result in even worse catastrophes in the future. If we choose global solidarity, it will be a victory not only against the coronavirus, but against all future epidemics and crises that might assail humankind in the 21st century.\n\nYuval Noah Harari

full force. Infections are increasing rapidly, schools, factories and bars have closed across the country, and government measures to slow the outbreak are becoming more draconian by the day.\n\nIn one crucial way, however, the country is proving remarkably resilient: relative to known infections, the number of deaths has so far been minuscule.\n\nAccording to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 13,979 coronavirus infections in Germany on Thursday afternoon, more than in any other country except China, Italy, Iran and Spain.\n\nAt the same time, Germany had only registered 42 deaths. Neighbouring France, by contrast, reported 9,058 infections and 243 deaths. Spain had 17,395 infections and 803 deaths. The US, the UK, Italy and even South Korea all show case fatality rates significantly higher than Germany.\n\nThe apparent anomaly has sparked debate in Germany and beyond, though experts warn against drawing sweeping conclusions. They argue that the country's low fatality rate most likely reflects the fact that the outbreak is still at a relatively early stage, and that the age profile of those affected has so far been younger than that in other countries. Younger patients without previous ailments have a much better chance of surviving Covid-19 than elderly patients.\n\nAnother factor that may help explain the variance is the unusually high number of tests being carried out in Germany. According to Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute, German laboratories are now conducting about 160,000 coronavirus tests every week -- more than some European countries have carried out in total since the crisis started. Even South Korea, which is conducting 15,000 tests a day and has been held up by virologists as an example to follow, appears to be testing less than Germany.\n\n\"This is about capacity. The capacity in Germany is very, very significant. We can conduct more than 160,000 tests per week, and that can be increased further,\" Prof Wieler told journalists this week. Test capabilities would be boosted not least in part by switching laboratories that specialise in animal health towards coronavirus checks. There was no sign that test kits were running low, Prof Wieler added.\n\nIn the short term at least, mass testing feeds through into a lower fatality rate because it allows authorities to detect cases of Covid-19 even in patients who suffer few or no symptoms, and who have a much better chance of survival. It also means that Germany is likely to have a lower number of undetected cases than countries where testing is less prevalent. Indeed, one notable feature of the coronavirus outbreak in Germany so far is the high number of relatively young patients: according to data from the Robert Koch Institute, more than 80 per cent of all people infected with the coronavirus are younger than 60.\n\n\"Especially at the beginning of the outbreak in Germany we saw many cases connected to people returning from skiing trips and similar holidays,\" said Matthias Stoll, a professor of medicine at the University of Hanover. \"These are predominantly people who are younger than 80 and who are fit enough to ski or engage in similar activities. Their risk of dying is comparatively low.\"\n\nHans-Georg Kr\u00e4usslich, a professor of medicine and the head of virology at the University Hospital in Heidelberg, said: \"In most cases the illness is mild and shows few symptoms, and we assume that the detection of such mild cases varies from country to country. In statistical terms that leads to a difference in case fatality rates.\"\n\nHowever, Prof Kr\u00e4usslich cautioned that the picture in Germany was likely to change in the weeks and months ahead: \"We are still at a relatively early stage in the outbreak in Germany. The overwhelming share of patients became infected only in the last week or two, and we will probably see more severe cases in the future as well as a change in the fatality rate.\"\n\nThat note of caution is echoed by virologists and epidemiologists across the country. Most expect the different national case fatality rates to converge as time passes and more countries uncover the true number of infections. But experts also point out that Germany has at least had the chance to prepare for a surge in serious infections, with hospitals across the country expanding intensive care capacity and boosting staff numbers and the government buying up as much critical equipment as it can.\n\nLast week, the federal government ordered an extra 10,000 life-saving ventilators from a German manufacturer, on top of the 25,000 that are already in place in hospitals across the country. The city state of Berlin, which has so far recorded 391 cases of Covid-19, is converting parts of the local trade fair ground into a 1,000-bed hospital for future coronavirus patients. Similar steps have been taken across the country.\n\n\"We are at the beginning, so we can still implement all the measures that have been called for,\" said Prof Wieler. \"We can still ensure that severely ill people can get treatment in the hospital.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Europe and the United States over recent days.\n\nThe company has also cancelled all new clothing orders from suppliers, such as factories in India and Bangladesh, but will continue to honour all orders already shipped or delivered to Primark warehouses or stores.\n\nThe moves are another devastating blow for the British retail industry and its global supply chains, with Topshop owner Arcadia, clothing brand River Island, Shoe chain Clarks, upmarket fashion brand Reiss, US-based discounter TK Maxx and Swedish home furnishings group Ikea having also closed their UK stores over the past week.\n\nOn Saturday, two more high street stalwarts -- department store John Lewis and sandwich chain Pret A Manger -- announced the closure of all outlets.\n\n\"This situation has been so fast moving,\" said Paul Marchant, Primark chief executive. \"We could not have foreseen that over the course of a week, our stores in every country in which we operate, with the exception of the UK, have had to close. We have therefore been left with no option but to take this action.\n\nHe added: \"This is unprecedented action for unprecedented and frankly unimaginable times.\"\n\nUnlike rivals H&M and Inditex-owned Zara, which have also had to close stores, Primark has no online sales arm that could offset the lost sales, though its owner ABF has the advantage of a food business that has been relatively unaffected.\n\nLast week, ABF said that its half-year results, due to be released next month, would be ahead of forecasts, but that it could no longer provide earnings guidance for the rest of the year.\n\nAdam Cochrane, an analyst at Citi, estimates that lost sales at Primark already equate to roughly \u00a385m of gross profit, or about 6 per cent of its full-year forecast, even before stores close. He added that already weaker UK sales and the possibility of longer shutdowns in Europe \"make this just a starting point\".\n\nOne person close to Primark's leadership said the company was also in \"mitigation discussions\" with suppliers, seeking to lessen the financial shock to clothing factories reliant on its orders to operate.\n\n\"We recognise and are deeply saddened that this will clearly have an effect throughout our entire supply chain,\" said Mr Marchant. \"We are in close and regular contact with our suppliers and very much hope that our normal trading relationships can resume as soon as possible.\"\n\nOther European countries such as Spain, Italy, Germany and France have ordered the closure of \"non-essential\" stores to reduce social contact that might spread the disease. In the US several retail chains have also closed temporarily in response to the pandemic, including Apple.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primark", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Primark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_British_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated British Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TK_Maxx", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TK Maxx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis_Partnership", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Lewis Partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pret_a_Manger", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pret a Manger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._&_J._Clark", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "C. & J.

Organization of failing to communicate an early warning about transmission of the coronavirus between humans, slowing the global response to the pandemic.\n\nHealth officials in Taipei said they alerted the WHO at the end of December about the risk of human-to-human transmission of the new virus but said its concerns were not passed on to other countries.\n\nTaiwan is excluded from the WHO because China, which claims it as part of its territory, demands that third countries and international bodies do not treat it in any way that resembles how independent states are treated.\n\nThe WHO's relationship with China has been criticised in the past, with some accusing the organisation of overly praising Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak despite allegations local officials had initially covered it up.\n\nTaiwan said its doctors had heard from mainland colleagues that medical staff were getting ill -- a sign of human-to-human transmission. Taipei officials said they reported this to both International Health Regulations (IHR), a WHO framework for exchange of epidemic prevention and response data between 196 countries, and Chinese health authorities on December 31.\n\nTaiwanese government officials told the Financial Times the warning was not shared with other countries.\n\n\"While the IHR's internal website provides a platform for all countries to share information on the epidemic and their response, none of the information shared by our country's [Centers for Disease Control] is being put up there,\" said Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan's vice-president.\n\n\"The WHO could not obtain first-hand information to study and judge whether there was human-to-human transmission of Covid-19. This led it to announce human-to-human transmission with a delay, and an opportunity to raise the alert level both in China and the wider world was lost,\" said Mr Chen, an epidemiologist by training who was health minister at the time of the Sars outbreak.\n\nChina's health ministry only confirmed human-to-human transmission on January 20, after the WHO said in mid-January there might be \"limited\" human-to-human transmission but stepped back from this view on the same day.\n\nAsked about the comments, the WHO said under its mandate it needed trust to \"hold frank and open discussions on sometimes sensitive issues\" and to enable this level of candour \"requires that we respect the confidentiality of such communications\". Western countries have since been accused of failing to act even when they were warned about human-to-human transmission.\n\nThe WHO has had to strike a delicate balance with China throughout the outbreak, with some accusing the organisation of being too pliant while medical experts said it had coped admirably.\n\nThe challenge of managing the relationship extended to negotiations over the wording of a report following a joint mission to China last month. The nine-day trip comprised 12 WHO experts and 13 Chinese officials and was focused on the country's response to the outbreak. Three of the WHO officials also visited Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, as part of the mission.\n\nThe WHO's Bruce Aylward, the Canadian epidemiologist who led the team, described the process as \"fantastic\". But he told the FT there was \"huge back and forth\" with Chinese officials about what went into the report.\n\nDr Aylward said Chinese health officials did not want to refer to the pathogen as \"dangerous\" as they regarded such terminology as reserved for diseases with higher mortality rates.\n\nChinese health officials also refused to include any reference to avoiding a \"second wave\" of coronavirus in the report, he said, so they compromised on \"a surge\" or \"resurgence\".\n\nDale Fisher, an infectious disease specialist at the National University of Singapore, said the team's Chinese counterparts requested the report not make reference to a \"dangerous pathogen\" because they said it had a \"bioterrorism type suggestion\", so they found a replacement.\n\nClifford Lane, clinical director of America's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who was one of two US officials on the mission, said the WHO team's Chinese members had \"a great desire to be precise\". He said the debates over wording did not amount to censorship but represented a \"bit of spin\".\n\nChina's ministry of health did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDespite the criticism, the WHO has impressed many medical professionals and public health experts with its speed and effectiveness.\n\n\"The WHO has filled its leadership role admirably,\" said Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University. \"Though you could quibble a bit about timings, they have done all the right things so far.\"\n\nDr Aylward added that whenever Chinese officials were reluctant to carry out a request or grant him access or were taken aback at his demands, he would always answer: \"You can't rule out another Wuhan if you don't know how and when this started.\"\n\nHe said that was always \"the trigger point for them\".\n\n\"They don't want another Wuhan,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"},

staff worldwide, with tens of thousands of people asked to take leave or made redundant. This extremely well trained human capital could be frozen out of the world economy for months.\n\nAt the same time, health systems worldwide are braced for an onslaught of sick people infected with coronavirus and need additional resources to cope. Surely there is a way to solve both problems at once.\n\nRight now the market is signalling that leisure capital -- and all the underlying resources and infrastructure it represents -- is no longer required. But rather than idling or destroying those resources permanently via bankruptcy or lay-offs, let's redeploy them.\n\nAirlines already employ a small army of crisis-trained professionals in the form of cabin crew. Globally the numbers run into the millions. In the UK, the sector directly employs more than 90,000 people. Cabin crew members, because of the physical nature of their jobs, tend to be relatively young and healthy. They're also used to working in tough conditions and all through the night.\n\nMost importantly they're already trained to a very high first-aid standard and used to following emergency protocols. Indeed, if any sector knows how to manage, reassure and prioritise among large, unruly crowds it is cabin crew.\n\nNo one should of course be forced to put themselves in danger. It is of the utmost importance that any redeployment is voluntary and determined by health. But, if and when such employees agree to work under emergency terms, they could be quickly retrained in airline training facilities, such as the ones that Virgin Atlantic boasts in Crawley.\n\nTheir new skills could be applied to administering tests, managing the flow of people and, most importantly, when the time comes, towards servicing the sick with food and drink.\n\nAirline hangers, meanwhile, could potentially house temporary hospital structures positioned close to vital supply and logistic networks.\n\nThe sector has already approached governments for bailout funds. But we should be creative about the way we structure them.\n\nWith a little initiative and ingenuity, digital securities could be originated very quickly to raise capital from investors for the purpose of funding the redeployment of these suddenly freed-up resources to where the government says they are needed most.\n\nInvestors offering up capital could benefit from government guarantees on the condition that the proceeds really are expressly used for funding responses to Covid-19.\n\nAlternatively they could be rewarded by the promise of extraordinary special dividends, once the virus is dealt with and revenues recover.\n\nSome might say investing in government bonds might achieve the same end. But having the government buy, rent or requisition private sector assets risks spooking markets only further. It also risks putting off private sector innovation in the field. If cleverly and speedily structured, such securities could do their bit in convincing markets that the collapse is only temporary, thus helping to calm market panic.\n\nAnd there is no need to stop with airlines. Capital transference can occur all across the economy. Cruise ships could be repurposed into floating hospitals for the mildly affected. Restaurants could be repurposed for the provision of meals on wheels services for the sick and quarantined. Uber drivers could be turned into ambulance drivers.\n\nChina deployed authoritarianism to meet the crisis head-on. Westerners marvelled as they built hospitals in record time, while simultaneously failing to understand the scale of the crisis that was about to hit them.\n\nNow we must find a way to achieve an equally powerful outcome through more liberal methods. Necessity is the mother of invention.

hopes that the region had contained the outbreak.\n\nOfficials in South Korea, Taiwan and parts of China and south-east Asia are rushing through new measures after a second wave of new infections following weeks of declines.\n\nExperts say the sudden increase in cases has revealed the limits of both China's sweeping lockdown of citizens and of the massive public testing and social distancing campaigns rolled out across Asia.\n\nBut it also highlights growing anxieties about new cases coming from abroad. The number of so-called imported infections has risen sharply as people flee the escalating coronavirus outbreak in Europe.\n\n\"What many people hadn't recognised is that it is only a temporary success, it is not a permanent success,\" said Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n\"There is a challenge to containment by the increasing number of imported infections in all of these locations at the moment from Europe, but in the future it could be from other parts of the world as well,\" he added.\n\nChina has been slowly unwinding restrictions after the countrywide lockdown that began in December. However, the number of imported coronavirus cases has jumped to 155 from fewer than 50 two weeks ago, according to Chinese government statistics.\n\nThe National Immigration Administration said on Monday that about 120,000 people a day had entered China from abroad since the World Health Organization labelled the virus a pandemic on March 11.\n\nMore than a dozen provinces, from Beijing to the border province of Yunnan, said international visitors, regardless of their condition and travel history, would be placed in quarantine for 14 days. Travelers will have to pay for food and accommodation during their quarantine.\n\nIn South Korea, which has suffered Asia's worst outbreak outside China, the emergence of new clusters and the risk of imported cases has rattled officials.\n\nAuthorities in Daegu -- South Korea's fourth-largest city where mass testing and isolation had led to a big reduction in new cases -- are now increasing inspections at high-risk facilities after the emergence of new clusters at nursing homes and churches.\n\n\"We believe the next two to three weeks will be very crucial,\" said Yoon Tae-ho, a senior government health official.\n\nTaiwan is closing its borders to practically all foreigners and intensifying quarantine measures on its own citizens. The moves come after officials accelerated efforts this week to identify and test Taiwanese citizens who had travelled abroad and seen a doctor for flu-like symptoms on their return.\n\nTaiwan's growth rate of new cases had been one of the lowest in the region, with just 100 confirmed cases as of Tuesday. But over the past two weeks, that number has started to climb with the country reporting at least 31 imported infections.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the number of cases climbed to 168 on March 17 from 116 on March 9, and almost 90 per cent of those new patients had travelled recently.\n\nOverseas students have rushed home as the virus spread across Europe. The government has told symptomatic people not to travel and anyone travelling from abroad will be subject to 14 days self-isolation from Thursday.\n\nThe number of new infections in Singapore, which has been lauded for its quick action to control the number of cases, has jumped 60 per cent to 266 in the past week.\n\n\"We expect more imported cases and, therefore, new clusters and new waves of infection, this time coming from many countries rather than one or two,\" Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's prime minister, warned last week.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

profound impact on public policy since its breathtaking results were shared with British and American officials last week.\n\nNo study has so exhaustively detailed the transmission of the virus through the UK and US population, the overwhelming pressure it places on health systems, or the limited effectiveness of individual measures to check its progress.\n\nLike any simulation, it rests on uncertain assumptions. Many factors remain unknown to the research team led by Professor Neil Ferguson, who this week fell ill with coronavirus symptoms. But even with this caveat the conclusions are brutally stark: democratic politicians face only terrible choices in the battle to save lives.\n\nThe starting point for analysis is an unchecked epidemic. This would infect eight out of 10 people, according to the researchers, with 510,000 deaths in the UK and 2.2m in the US.\n\nWhile the estimate draws on hospitalisation rates in Italy, it assumes every patient receives adequate care. In practice the researchers find available beds for critical patients would actually be exceeded by the second week of April. At peak, for every 30 patients requiring critical care, just one could be treated adequately.\n\nThe mortality peak would occur after about three months. Because of its geographic size and younger population, the US lags the UK in how rapidly the virus spreads and the rate of death it causes.\n\nWhile a vaccine is developed -- a process that can take up to 18 months -- or antiviral drugs identified, US and UK governments are left with two extraordinary choices.\n\nThe first is a \"mitigation strategy\" to reduce the peak of infection while the population builds immunity; the second a more drastic \"suppression\" approach to quell the epidemic, whatever the cost to the economy, or trauma for social life.\n\nBritain and America started with mitigation measures. But the limits of what can be achieved -- even with a combination of stringent measures -- are laid bare by the data.\n\nThe most effective mix tested involves asking people to stay home for a week if they show symptoms, quarantining their household, and urging over-70s to keep a distance from others.\n\nThis would reduce demand for critical beds by two-thirds and halve the number of deaths during the three month period when the measures are applied. Parts of the population would build immunity, eventually driving transmission rates down.\n\nBut, crucially, demand for critical beds would still outstrip capacity eight times over in both the US and the UK. The Imperial researchers describe it as \"perhaps our most significant conclusion\".\n\nGovernments are racing to expand critical care. Yet even assuming all patients could be treated, the Imperial researchers conclude mitigation strategies alone would leave about 250,000 dead in the UK and around 1.2m in America. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, recognised that the ultimate toll would be too much for the country to bear.\n\nMore drastic curbs on society can make a big difference. Short of a complete lockdown on movement, the most effective scenario modelled involves isolating people with symptoms, reducing everyone's social contact by 75 per cent, quarantining households and closing schools and universities for five months.\n\nIf sustained, the measures can choke the epidemic to bring patient numbers to something hospitals could potentially cope with. The study does not, however, quantify related costs: the devastating blow to the economy, consequences for general wellbeing, or mortality rates for other diseases.\n\nThis raises the important question of whether -- and at what cost -- such a curfew could be maintained by any government in the western world.\n\nWithout a vaccine, as soon as the toughest restrictions are relaxed, a second wave of infections would be expected to follow.\n\nContact tracing and intensive testing -- as deployed in South Korea -- can help extend the effectiveness of measures to stifle infectious spread, as can technology if concerns about civil rights are set aside.\n\nBut given available resources in America and Britain, the timescales for vaccines, and the pace of transmission, the researchers conclude suppression is \"the only viable strategy\" at the moment, while being in doubt about the profound challenges.\n\n\"No public health intervention with such disruptive effects on society has been previously attempted,\" the paper concludes.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Italy, Switzerland and Austria this month when the coronavirus outbreak in Europe suddenly turned the trip into a race home.\n\nWith borders and mountain resorts closing around her and her flight back to Singapore cancelled, she drove to Germany and caught whatever plane she could back to the south-east Asian city state.\n\n\"The situation was changing every few hours\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but once you're back in Singapore you know everything is efficient and you will be looked after,\" she said.\n\nMs Ibrahim did not know just how lucky she was to have made it home to the city, an international financial hub known for its quasi-authoritarian but effective government. Three days after her return, she tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nSingapore reported its first two deaths from the pathogen only this weekend, despite being one of the first countries to be hit by the outbreak outside China two months ago. That has made it one of the safest places in the world for patients of the disease, which has already killed almost 13,000 people globally.\n\nThe city's success in dealing with the outbreak is attributed to the government's speed in imposing border controls soon after the disease first erupted in China, meticulous tracing of known carriers, a clear public communication strategy and a bit of luck.\n\n\"There is nothing they should be doing differently,\" said Ying-Ru Jacqueline Lo, the World Health Organization representative to Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam and Singapore.\n\nAfter controlling the first infections, Singapore now faces a second wave of cases from returning travellers, such as Ms Ibrahim. Authorities tightened travel restrictions and social distancing measures after the number of cases more than doubled to 432 in the past week. Yet many analysts believe Singapore will also bring the second wave under control.\n\nSome of the city-state's advantages in confronting the outbreak are difficult for larger western countries to replicate, such as its small population of 5.7m. It also learnt from its experience of Sars in 2003, which forced it to strengthen its healthcare system.\n\nBut similar to some Asian neighbours, such as Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, which have also managed to slow infection rates, Singapore's example could contain lessons for the US and Europe, which have been caught wrongfooted by the virus.\n\nAs soon as information about the disease emerged from Wuhan, the city at the centre of China's outbreak, Singapore began preparing by ramping up laboratory capacity for mass testing and developing its own test kits. This was seen as instrumental to containing infections and not overwhelming hospitals, a problem faced by countries such as Italy.\n\n\"We used the lead time that China gave us by its massive shutdown to really refine our readiness,\" said Dale Fisher, professor of infectious diseases at the National University of Singapore. \"By the time we had one of our cases, we were able to do tests and within a week, tests were available in all major hospitals.\"\n\nSome experts say the fact most patients in the city have been below the age of 65 also helps explain the low number of deaths.\n\nBut Leo Yee Sin, executive director at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, which was set up after Sars and is helping spearhead Singapore's response to the coronavirus, said: \"I don't consider us lucky. We are just giving the best of critical care to those affected.\"\n\nShe said 15 per cent of confirmed cases were on ventilators in intensive care units, with two undergoing ecmo treatment, whereby blood was drained out of a person's body and oxygenated in a machine.\n\nThe country's business community also moved quickly. Soon after Singapore reported its first cases, banks divided their teams between offices, home working and emergency trading floors, many of which were in an outlying industrial area near the city's Changi airport.\n\nBut while government measures to contain the first wave of infections were effective, they also raised questions about the invasiveness of the state. Surveillance cameras, police officers and contact-tracing teams have helped the government find 7,065 close contacts of confirmed cases, who have all been quarantined.\n\nThe government on Friday launched TraceTogether, an app that uses bluetooth to record distance between users and the duration of their encounters. People consent to give the information, which is encrypted and deleted after 21 days, to the health ministry. The department can contact users in case of \"probable contact\" with an infected individual.\n\n\"There's a higher degree of acceptance of being monitored by the state,\" said Chong Ja Ian, associate professor of political science at the NUS. \"That makes some of the more invasive methods for contact tracing easier.\"\n\nBut, he added, once such mechanisms are in place, \"it opens the door for someone five to 10 years down the road to make use of this space in ways that are perhaps less noble\".\n\nThe government has also used a tough new online falsehoods law to correct misinformation in posts about the coronavirus, which critics have argued gave authorities too much latitude to censor.\n\nAnd even though Singapore has been successful so far, the battle is far from over. To deal with a potential second wave of infections, the government on Sunday banned short-term visitors from entering or transiting through the country. Returning residents will have to undergo quarantine for 14 days at home or risk a fine of up to S$10,000 ($6,900) and/or six months in jail.\n\n\"This is going to be a long duration battle. We are only seeing the beginning,\" Prof Leo said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

the coronavirus epidemic could lead to between 35,000 and 70,000 excess deaths over the next year, according to an instant analysis by scientists from University College London, the University of Cambridge and Health Data Research UK.\n\nThe team of clinicians, statisticians and epidemiologists says the UK measures do not go far enough in stopping the spread of the disease or identifying the most vulnerable high-risk groups. The government should \"do more in the pursuit of suppressing the epidemic whether through enforced lockdowns or enforced social distancing rather than voluntary measures\", they add.\n\nThe study -- a rapid analysis not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal -- estimates the excess number of deaths caused by Covid-19 in relation to underlying medical conditions and age, using NHS health records from 3.8m adults in England.\n\nDr Amitava Banerjee of UCL, the lead author, said: \"The UK government is currently following a partial suppression policy of population-wide social distancing, combined with home isolation of cases, as well as school and university closures, but this is currently not [mandatory].\n\n\"Our study indicates that the government should implement more stringent suppression at population level to avoid not just immediate deaths but also long-term excess deaths,\" he said.\n\nThe research adjusts the deaths likely to be caused directly by the epidemic, taking account of the fact that some would have died anyway from other causes. So far almost all Covid-19 deaths in the UK have occurred in people who were either elderly or suffering from underlying disease.\n\nEven so, the study comes up with what the authors regard as an unacceptably high number of excess deaths for the current government policy: 35,000 to 70,000.\n\nThe researchers appealed to the NHS to make more data available for studies like theirs. Harry Hemingway, UCL professor of clinical epidemiology, said: \"Legislation is urgently needed to free up nationwide NHS data so that clinicians and services can rapidly learn ways to tackle the consequences of the epidemic, both in those with and those without the virus.\n\n\"The current regulatory and legislative environment around NHS data hampers the public health emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statistician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peer review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Epidemiology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Epidemiology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F8f94d550-6c8f-11ea-89df-41bea055720b?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "eventUri": "eng-5622853", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 2167}, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 2167, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6003486229", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-22", "time": "16:21:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-22T16:21:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-22T16:21:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/c98362f0-6aa4-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3", "title": "This time, small guys should get the bailouts", "body": "In the previous crisis, Washington bailed out banks. Today, it's about to bail out big business.\n\nThe corporate sector looks a lot like the financial sector did pre-2008: debt-laden, with some sectors highly leveraged, and most of them reliant on financial engineering to create the illusion of growth and innovation.\n\nAmerican companies used to reinvest their earnings to boost productive capacity. Now, they mostly generate \"value\" by downsizing and distributing money to the richest in the US.\n\nThe question, now that the entire economy is collapsing at once, is who will be first in line to get bailed out?\n\nWill it be the airlines, who spent the majority of their copious free cash in recent years on buybacks?\n\nOr manufacturers such as Boeing, one of the great outsourcers of all time, which says it needs $60bn to preserve jobs in its supply chain? Or should the first cheques be written to Big Oil, the cruise industry, hotels, hospitals, casinos or restaurants? Even pork producers, drug companies and drone manufacturers see an opportunity to get on the fiscal stimulus bandwagon.\n\nBefore considering who should be allowed to jump to the front of this very long queue, let's stop for a minute to consider how we got to this position.\n\nIn 2008, the subprime meltdown triggered a systemic financial crisis that required a bailout of banks to prevent what might have become a second Great Depression. But the strongest of these banks then thrived, becoming richer and more concentrated than they were before the crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, millions of Americans had their homes taken from them because they couldn't make their mortgage payments. Many of these homes were in turn bought-up by private equity groups, which could pay cash for them on courthouse steps. Blackstone became the country's largest owner of family homes.\n\nOver the ensuing decade, tech firms, tax cuts, low rates and easy money also made equity markets rise. But this \"recovery\" benefited mainly the asset-owning class. For most people, weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, remained roughly where they were in 1974. The anger this fuelled, directed at the\u200amainstream\u200aof both parties, was how the US ended up with President Donald Trump. It's also what has kept the Democratic socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders going for so long.\n\nBailouts will again be needed now, given a market downturn that mirrors 1929 and an economic contraction likely to be sharper than during the previous financial crisis. But if we want capitalism and liberal democracy to survive Covid-19, we cannot afford to repeat the mistaken \"socialise the losses, privatise the gains\" approach used a decade ago.\n\nWe have to start by protecting individual citizens and consumers. Coronavirus has exposed how vulnerable much of the American population is.\n\nMy children attend the New York City public school system, along with 1m others. One reason the schools waited a while to shut down for virus mitigation is that three-quarters of its students live at or below the poverty line.\n\nOne in 10 are homeless. Many get the majority of their calories every day from free school breakfasts and lunches. (Schools are still operating a grab-and-go meal operation).\n\nThis is one of the many reasons why I am for the immediate cash payouts to individuals that have been suggested by many economists. In an ideal world, we would do that by means testing. But there is no time. We can recapture unnecessary payments the other side of the crisis, via the tax code. Meanwhile, I would encourage those who don't need their cheques to give them to those who do: workers such as my cleaning lady, who cannot work from home.\n\nI would also love to see a federally underwritten three-month moratorium on all rent, mortgage payments and student debt payments, as well as government reimbursement for all healthcare costs associated with the virus.\n\n\"The most important step right now is debt forbearance,\" says credit expert Richard Vague, who has studied the fallout of past financial crises. \"I don't believe this will be detrimental to the economy long-term.\"\n\nWhen it comes to corporate bailouts, small and midsized businesses should come first. Over 96 per cent of them say that they are already feeling the pain of Covid-19, and over half claim they won't be able to stay in business for more than three months in the current situation, according to a Goldman Sachs survey.\n\nThey should be given grants, not loans. Many run tight margins as it is, and would not be able to survive any additional debt burden. These small and midsized businesses, which make up 83 per cent of US payrolls, should come first. Unlike large companies, their capital expenditure has also risen in recent years. These are the businesses that we need to save now.\n\nOn that note, lawmakers should be ashamed that the virus aid bill passed by Congress gave big companies, but not smaller ones, a free pass when it comes to giving workers paid sick leave. To the extent that Washington does provide corporate bailouts, they must not let big companies off the hook.\n\nIf these companies want government money, they need to protect their workers too. Washington should also consider taking preferred equity stakes in such companies. Unlike the bank bailouts of 12 years ago, let's socialise not just the losses but also the gains.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [],

series on the economic cures for the coronavirus crisis, in which leading commentators and policymakers give their advice on how to alleviate a devastating global slowdown.\n\nThe writer is a fellow in economics at Balliol College, Oxford university, and the author of 'A World Without Work'\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is a disaster for many workers. In the UK, for instance, we often forget that prosperity does not rest on a handful of well-regarded business titans and big-named companies -- many of whom are now visibly lobbying the government for financial support.\n\nIt also depends on the nearly 5m self-employed workers and 6m small businesses that live a comparably hidden economic life, out of public sight, and with little influence over policy. The pandemic provides a dramatic reminder of their contribution. And it is they who are most threatened today.\n\nBut our traditional policy instruments cannot reach them. Changes in interest rates do not help self-employed workers who face disappearing incomes and no sick pay.\n\nFinancial stability packages do not bail out the vast number of restaurants, theatres, caf\u00e9s, pubs and shops that will continue to see footfall collapse in the days to come. Big infrastructure investments do not support those small businesses -- 99 per cent of all companies in the UK -- whose pockets are not deep enough to survive the disruption of the coming months.\n\nThe time has come, then, for something completely different -- a Universal Basic Income. A cash payment made to everyone, with no strings attached, can support these people and their families. Providing everyone in the UK with \u00a31,000 per month would give a direct and instantaneous burst of financial relief to the millions who find themselves unable to make basic ends meet.\n\nI approach the notion of a UBI from a position of scepticism. In recent years, the popularity of such a scheme has surged. Many have seen it as a necessary response to the threat of automation, a way to support displaced workers who might find themselves without a job, and an income, in the future.\n\nBut in my own work looking at the impact of technology on the labour market, I have tended to view it as an imperfect response to a challenge that we do not yet face. For now the problem is not a world without enough jobs, but one in which people lack the skills needed for the jobs that have to be done.\n\nThe arrival of coronavirus has changed my attitude. Robots may not have taken all the jobs just yet, but the pandemic is decimating the demand that those jobs rely upon. Andrew Yang, the Democratic US presidential candidate, who built his campaign upon the promise of a UBI, put it well on Twitter: \"I should have been talking about a pandemic instead of automation.\"\n\nA UBI could be affordable. For instance, handing out \u00a31,000 cash per person per month would cost the government about \u00a366bn a month -- a fraction of the nearly \u00a3500bn bailout the UK needed to stay afloat during the 2008 financial crisis. It would only be a temporary measure.\n\nThe government says the UK will see half of all coronavirus cases in a three to four-week period either side of the peak in infections; 95 per cent of cases over a nine to 10-week period. We can still hope this will be a short-term crisis, requiring only temporary, albeit extraordinary, measures.\n\nIt also would be politically feasible, and not just in the UK. A UBI is emerging as one of those rare policy proposals that makes the political spectrum bend back on itself, with people on opposite ends meeting in violent agreement.\n\nJason Furman, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under president Barack Obama, noted: \"Congress should send you $1,000 -- and another $500 for each of your children -- as soon as possible\". And Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, is now \"looking at sending cheques to Americans immediately\".\n\nWhile a UBI like this might sound a little basic, its simplicity is its strength. There is no need for complicated means-testing and monitoring, no requirement for clunky bureaucracy and administration. In Britain, everyone gets \u00a31,000 -- as simple as that. As a result, we can do this quickly; if the peak of the crisis is to come in weeks, that is a virtue not to be underestimated.\n\nIn 1942, amid the devastation of the second world war, William Beveridge published Social Insurance and Allied Service, transforming ordinary peoples' lives at a time of great crisis by leading to the creation of the National Health Service and the expansion of National Insurance.\n\n\"A revolutionary moment in the world's history\", he writes in the opening pages, \"is a time for revolutions, not for patching\".\n\nOur crisis is different. But like Beveridge, we must respond to it with imagination and open-mindedness. Tinkering and tweaking existing interventions is not enough. We must be far bolder.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki",

drones equipped with loudspeakers and cameras to enforce a coronavirus lockdown.\n\nChula Vista police bought two $11,000 drones made by the Chinese company DJI, doubling the size of its small fleet, and plans to rig them up with speakers and night vision cameras.\n\n\"We have not traditionally mounted speakers to our drones, but\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009if we need to cover a large area to get an announcement out, or if there were a crowd somewhere that we needed to disperse -- we could do it without getting police officers involved,\" said Vern Sallee, one of the city's police captains.\n\n\"The outbreak has changed my view of expanding the programme as rapidly as I can,\" he added.\n\nOnly weeks ago, US officials warned that Chinese-made drones, such as those made by DJI, the world's largest civilian camera drone company, were a threat to security.\n\nNow drones could end up playing a vital role in helping to combat the coronavirus as emergency responders and delivery companies look for ways to limit human contact over the coming weeks.\n\nSpencer Gore, chief executive of Impossible Aerospace, a California-based maker of high-performance drones used by first responders, said he is \"working like crazy\" to help a variety of other US law enforcement agencies -- which he cannot name -- set up their own drone programmes. Part of his pitch is that his company uses \"Made in the USA\" hardware.\n\n\"What we saw in China, and what we're probably going to see around the world, is using drones with cameras and loudspeakers to fly around to see if people are gathering where they shouldn't be, and telling them to go home,\" Mr Gore said. \"It seems a little Orwellian but this could save lives.\n\nBrendan Schulman, vice-president of policy and legal affairs at DJI, said in light of the national emergency, the Federal Aviation Administration \"should readily grant waivers on restrictions that might impede beneficial operations\".\n\nThe FAA, which did not respond to a request for comment, is still working on how to ensure drones can be safe autonomously or beyond the line of sight of pilots.\n\nBut groups like the Commercial Drone Alliance -- a non-profit backed by dozens of companies including Apple, AT&T, Uber, dronemaker Skydio and Alphabet unit Wing -- are hoping the regulatory process can be accelerated because of the coronavirus. \"There are many use cases for drones that can aid the nation,\" said Lisa Ellman, the group's executive director.\n\nAmong Captain Sallee's aims is to communicate with the homeless community, who are likely to lack reliable information on the virus outbreak. \"We need to tell them we actually have resources for them -- they are vulnerable right now,\" he said. \"It might be impractical or unsafe for our officers to be put into those areas.\"\n\nAt present his police department flies 10-15 operations per day, but only for emergency situations. He is now working with the FAA to expand usage to protect the community during the virus outbreak.\n\n\"This crisis could be a catalyst to spur the FAA to free up resources faster,\" said Captain Sallee.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki",

They could initially be in place for about a fortnight.\n\nMr Johnson did not deny that plans for a lockdown existed, and his allies say only that \"the situation is moving fast\". A number of senior Whitehall officials have told the Financial Times they expect the plan to be implemented in London on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, Rishi Sunak, Mr Johnson's chancellor, and Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, were drawing up plans to prevent coronavirus laying waste to the British economy. Tory MPs now talk about the risk of the \"D word\": depression.\n\nElected with an 80-seat House of Commons majority in December, Mr Johnson had anticipated at least four years of untrammelled power, but like other world leaders his authority has been challenged by an invisible enemy.\n\nThe speed with which the crisis has escalated has taken Mr Johnson -- and the scientists upon whose advice he has been acting -- by surprise, although few around the world predicted chaos on such a grand scale so soon.\n\nMr Johnson said he would have to lead something akin to a \"wartime government\" and he did nothing to deny the widespread expectation that London could be closed down as part of an escalating attempt to halt the virus.\n\nAsked about a possible shutdown, he said: \"We don't rule out -- and it would be wrong to do so -- taking further and faster measures in due course.\"\n\nIt was only a week ago that Mr Sunak announced an apparently generous \u00a312bn package of support for the economy to cope with the crisis; this week he announced \u00a3330bn of loan guarantees and a further \u00a320bn in fiscal support.\n\nBut that is only the start, as Mr Sunak has admitted, and the chancellor will this week announce a massive package of measures to try to keep people in work and to help those laid off as the crisis deepens.\n\nMr Johnson hinted that Britain was about to become a very different place, saying that while he cherished freedom, the country was about to be asked to make sacrifices: \"These are very, very important choices we are making in our daily lives.\"",

as Boris Johnson prepares sweeping new measures -- including school closures -- to tackle the rapid spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, said the UK government was about to announce \"more stringent measures\" for London, which Mr Johnson has conceded has become the country's worst affected region.\n\nAsked how far the UK was from a \"complete lockdown\", Ms Sturgeon said the capital city might see tougher measures first because it was further ahead on the \"curve\" of the outbreak.\n\nScotland's first minister is fully briefed on UK-wide coronavirus measures and Mr Johnson's team admitted that officials were considering big new restrictions to daily life in London. \"Things are moving fast,\" one said.\n\nIn the UK, more than 700 cases have been reported in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to more than 2,600.\n\nA decision on whether to lock down London -- similar to the shutdown in force in cities such as Paris and Brussels -- would be based on the latest advice presented to the Cobra emergency committee, which has its latest meeting on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nRestrictions could include the closure of public transport, with pharmacies or supermarkets among the only outlets to remain open.\n\nSchools across the UK are also expected to close by the weekend, although special provision would be made for the children of key workers, including NHS staff, to avoid the risk off parents have to take time of work for child care.\n\nGavin Williamson, education secretary, will make a statement to the House of Commons on plans for schools, including provision for children in receipt of free school meals, at 5pm on Wednesday.\n\nMr Johnson's allies say no new measures were planned for the capital on Wednesday or Thursday, but government insiders say the lockdown might be announced on Friday. \"People are looking at it, but it's too early to say when or whether we will do this,\" said another government official.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman said: \"London seems to be moving ahead of other parts of the UK and he [Boris Johnson] advised people in London to pay particular attention to the measures we have been putting in place.\"\n\nSadiq Khan, London's mayor, has complained that he is not being kept fully informed of the UK government's plans and his allies said he was not clear whether the lockdown would take place or what form it might take.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

infected with the coronavirus and almost 8m may need to be taken into hospital in a \"reasonable\" worst-case scenario, according to a leaked document from Public Health England which provides the bleakest assessment so far of the course of the outbreak.\n\nThe assessment comes as prime minister Boris Johnson announced the start of daily press conferences to inform the public on measures to fight the coronavirus, amid criticism of the government's communications strategy.\n\nMr Johnson or another senior minister will host the media events with senior medical and scientific officers, as the government prepares to increase \"social distancing\" measures to help contain the disease.\n\nThe PHE document, reported by the Guardian newspaper, suggested that the Covid-19 virus could remain a threat for a year. The newspaper said the document was drawn up as a \"secret\" briefing for senior NHS officials.\n\nDr Susan Hopkins, deputy director of PHE's National Infection Service said: \"PHE used reasonable worse-case scenario figures, to restate the importance for people with symptoms to stay at home, including healthcare workers in order to reduce the spread of the virus.\"\n\nThe document stated: \"As many as 80 per cent of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15 per cent (7.9m people) may require hospitalisation.\"\n\nChris Whitty, the government's chief medical adviser, used the 80 per cent figure as a worst-case scenario at a briefing last week. The 15 per cent hospitalisation figure is believed to reflect data from other countries.\n\nProf Whitty has said he expects the virus to reach its peak in about 12-14 weeks, but the government's strategy is aimed at flattening that peak in order to avoid the NHS being overwhelmed.\n\nOver the weekend there was criticism that the prime minister's office was communicating its strategy via unsourced briefings and there was confusion after Matt Hancock, health secretary, denied that the government's plans include allowing the British population to acquire \"herd immunity\" to the virus.\n\nThe PHE document was drawn up recently by its emergency preparedness and response team and approved by Dr Hopkins, who is PHE's lead official dealing with the outbreak. It has been shared with hospital bosses and senior doctors in the NHS in England.\n\nIt paints a sobering picture of the huge impact the illness will have on the normal running of the country. It says that about 500,000 of the 5m people who work \"in essential services and critical infrastructure\" will be off sick at any one time at the peak of the epidemic which is expected to last a month. This includes 1m NHS staff and 1.5m in social care.\n\nIt estimates that at least 10 per cent of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time \"during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.\" The latest government advice is that anyone in that position should stay at home for seven days, underlining the high level of disruption the nation will face.\n\nThe document will also raise fresh questions over the ability of the health service, whose performance has deteriorated rapidly this winter even before the virus emerged, to cope with the onslaught of additional patients.\n\nThe document reportedly said that laboratories are under \"significant demand pressures\" and are unable to cope with the number of people with symptoms who need to be tested. It also notes that, due to the pressure on testing facilities, even NHS staff will not be tested, despite the risk they could pass the illness on to their patients.\n\nOn Monday afternoon Mr Johnson will chair another meeting of the Cobra emergency committee. It is expected to include discussion on current modelling of the outbreak and next steps on plans around shielding elderly and vulnerable people, household isolation and mass gatherings\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The prime minister and this government are committed to keeping the public informed every step of the way about what we're doing to fight the spread of coronavirus, when we're doing it and why we're doing it. At all times we will be led by the science to bring forward the right responses at the right time to this global pandemic.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial

economic rescue fund to extend credit lines to all member states to fight \"a global shock that has no precedents in modern history\" as the death count from coronavirus in Italy overtook China for the first time.\n\nGiuseppe Conte, Italian prime minister, told the Financial Times that the European Stability Mechanism, a \u20ac500bn fund that was established in 2012 during the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis, needed to be put into action to urgently respond to the virus outbreak that has claimed more than 3,400 Italian lives so far.\n\nHis call came as France also demanded urgent joint action across the eurozone, imploring reluctant countries led by Germany to join forces and back the use of the ESM or permit the issuances of common bonds in the fight against the crisis. Bruno Le Maire, French finance minister, warned in parliament that \"either the eurozone responds in a united manner to the economic crisis and emerges stronger, or it is all over the place and is in danger of disappearing.\"\n\nThe European Central Bank intervened in stricken markets on Wednesday night as it launched a late-night plan to buy an additional \u20ac750bn in bonds. The move delivered a boost to shattered investor confidence, but some officials fear it could reduce the pressure on cautious eurozone states, led by Germany, to take co-ordinated budgetary action to fight the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"The ESM was crafted with a different type of crisis in mind, so it must be adapted to the new circumstances so that we can make use of its full firepower,\" Mr Conte said. \"The route to follow is to open ESM credit lines to all member states to help them fight the consequences of the Covid epidemic, under the condition of full accountability by each member state on the way resources are spent\".\n\nFrance echoed Mr Conte's calls for greater solidarity as officials in Brussels continued to work on plans for deploying the ESM in the fight against a deepening recession in the region. \"Do we breach the taboo on European financial solidarity?\" asked one French official. \"Are we capable of financing together? Are we ready to do it?\"\n\nOn Thursday official numbers confirmed that Italy overtook China as the country with the largest number of coronavirus deaths, with the total rising to 3,405.\n\nMr Conte, who was a little-known legal academic with no history in Italian politics when he was unexpectedly thrust into the position of prime minister in 2018, has earned the approval of voters during this crisis. A national opinion poll published this week showed that seven out of 10 Italians regarded him favourably and were impressed by his handling of the outbreak.\n\n\"We are confronted with an exogenous, global shock that has no precedents in modern history,\" he said. \"And as political leaders we are called to make necessary, bold, yet tragic choices.\"\n\nMr Conte praised the moves taken by the ECB this week, but said more must be done to tackle a downturn that economists fear could be even sharper than the last financial crisis.\n\n\"Knowing President [Christine] Lagarde and having had several conversations with her I had little doubt -- the ECB has the will and the power to support the euro and it will do so now and in the future. Monetary policy alone cannot solve all problems, we need to do the same on the fiscal front and, as I already mentioned, time is of the essence\".\n\nMr Conte said that \"the best, probably the only way\" to stave off large-scale economic damage in Europe would be the creation of a common European debt instrument to \"fight against the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic\".\n\n\"What we need is not just a co-ordinated reaction but a bold European reaction to sustain our economies,\" he said. \"This bond will allow all European countries to access finances at the same conditions, and will put the whole European economy on the best footing to recover rapidly once the emergency will be over.\"\n\nItaly was the first country in Europe to impose stringent restrictions on the movement of people and its economy to combat the spread of the coronavirus. France and Spain subsequently followed Rome's lead in enforcing social distancing measures.\n\n\"Unfortunately, other European countries are now starting to go through the same predicament we had to suffer for the past several weeks. And I can tell that every single day is a heavy one. I express all my solidarity to the peoples and to the leaders that are now confronted with the terrible situation that I and the Italian population already endured\".\n\nMr Conte said that \"the Italian example\" of fighting back against the virus was helping other nations in their response, but that it was too early to say if Italy's restrictions would be lifted as originally planned in early April.\n\n\"Many countries are following these steps, the Italian example, if you like. This is an unprecedented situation. It affects all of us,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict when we will be able to return to normality. Only in a few days, and based on the evaluations of technical-scientific committee, I will be able to assess the effectiveness of the measures we took.\"\n\nMr Conte warned that if Europe failed to make a robust and unified response to the virus it risked emboldening nationalist politicians on the continent and weakening support for the EU.\n\n\"Europe must show unity and solidarity, there is no alternative to this,\" he said. \"If Europe fails, I fear it will fade away in the conscience of our fellow citizens, giving space to the worst nationalistic instincts.

cannot help but feel proud. With just 59 confirmed cases and one death as of Sunday, Taiwan has managed to avoid a major outbreak of a disease which has paralysed neighbouring China. Apart from most people wearing masks on public transport, life goes on as usual.\n\nThe experience is a stark contrast to 2003, when Prof Su, then the director of Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control, was at the forefront of the battle to contain severe acute respiratory syndrome, which had a devastating impact on the country.\n\nThe mood in Taiwan also drastically differs from the sense of panic and confusion in Europe and the US, where the arrival of the pandemic at their doorstep has come as such a surprise to many.\n\n\"The situation in other countries now resembles the situation we were in during the first few weeks of the Sars spread in Taiwan in early 2003,\" says Prof Su. \"You are not ready, you have no experience.\"\n\nThe good news for the western governments now scrambling to respond is that the measures Taiwan and other Asian countries have implemented over the past three months have been shown to slow and even blunt the impact of disease.\n\nEarly travel restrictions, aggressive testing and screening of contacts and strict quarantine rules have been key. Universal healthcare, clear management structures for the public health response and proactive communication to get the population on board have also helped.\n\nThese policies have managed to contain the virus in Taiwan and Singapore and reduce or slow infection rates in South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan.\n\nWhile the World Health Organization has suggested other countries learn from China, which it has praised for \"perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history\", some health experts believe that Asia's democracies, such as Taiwan and South Korea, may be better models for epidemic management in western countries, given the different nature of the Chinese political system.\n\n\"One of the most important factors in the success of our response has been transparency,\" says Chang Shan-chwen, a leading expert on infectious diseases and convener of the expert advisory panel to the Central Epidemic Command Center, which manages Taipei's response. \"In [China's] autocratic system, every citizen will stay at home when told so. But this is something which cannot be easily achieved in free and democratic countries.\"\n\nThe bad news for western governments, however, is that one vital component of the Asian response cannot be replicated. The region's approach has been shaped by the traumatic memories of other recent epidemics -- most notably Sars -- which meant that governments were better prepared to react fast and forcefully and populations much more willing to co-operate.\n\nLeighanne Yuh, an expert in Korean history and culture at Korea University, says the experience from Sars and other recent epidemics, as well as watching the rapidity of the coronavirus's spread through China, has instilled a \"sense of urgency\" and adherence to \"social courtesies\" across the country.\n\n\"Because South Korea has had these types of outbreaks already occur, they know the kind of steps that need to be taken and how serious the danger is,\" she says. \"If we compare it to the United States, which hasn't really been exposed to these things, at least for a long time, their response has been quite different.\"\n\nFor South Korea, the Asian country that suffered the biggest outbreak apart from China, testing as many people as possible has been a key pillar in its strategy for combating coronavirus.\n\nAt \"drive-through\" testing facilities, officials clad in white hazmat suits can be seen leaning into cars to take fluid samples from the driver and passengers. The test results are returned in a matter of hours and help reduce crowding and contamination exposure at hospitals.\n\nEven more ubiquitous are alerts flashing on smartphone screens updating the public on new infections in their area, as well as health officials' twice-daily broadcasts updating containment efforts. The focus on open communication, coupled with a an online system to track those people who have been infected, has helped limit the spread of the virus.\n\nThe approach appears to be working. South Korea was stunned in late February after a cluster of cases connected to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a quasi-Christian sect, saw the number of infections soar to more than 5,000 from fewer than 50 over the course of 10 days. Now, 270,000 tests and countless alerts and press conferences later, the number of daily new cases has declined from more than 900 at its peak to 76 on Sunday, with a total of 8,162 people infected.\n\nThe country is not yet out of the woods -- 100 cases discovered at a call centre in Seoul last week left officials on edge about further clusters. But the success to date reflects that tough lessons have been learnt from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which infected 185, killed 38 and caused public panic in 2015.\n\nIn June that year a special WHO committee lambasted Seoul for a series of critical shortcomings including a lack of awareness of the virus among both healthcare workers and the general public, poor infection control measures in hospitals and infected patients failing to remain isolated.\n\nJegal Dong-wook, a professor of laboratory medicine at the Catholic University of Korea Seoul St Mary's Hospital, says many hospitals have since been equipped with infection control units and negative pressure rooms, which are used to isolate infected patients. The country's infectious disease guidelines were also overhauled, advising people with respiratory symptoms to first visit a specialist screening centre rather than hospitals.\n\nThe Mers outbreak also exposed a lack of access to adequate testing kits, which left hospitals scrambling to deal with a rising number of suspected cases.\n\nHong Ki-ho, an official at the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine, says a new regulatory system was introduced to fast-track approvals for newly-developed testing kits when the nation faces the threat of emergency situations, like infectious disease outbreaks.\n\n\"One of the companies I know took around two weeks from the application point to its actual use [during the coronavirus outbreak]. This development of test kits and their use for coronavirus was possible thanks to the adoption of that new emergency use approval system,\" Mr Hong says.\n\nOutside the Shincheonji followers, which have accounted for more than half of South Korea's cases, public adherence to common sense protective measures like the wearing of masks, using hand sanitiser and limiting human-to-human contact is near-universal, leaving little need for strict government enforcement.\n\nA population ready to comply with strict controls has also been key for Japan in containing coronavirus. The government's handling of the failed quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and its policy of testing relatively few people have come under heavy criticism. But experts say social and cultural norms that impose self-discipline and obedience to official guidance are one of the reasons Japan has so far managed to limit the number of infections.\n\n\"There is a social norm that you should not cause trouble to other people,\" says Kazuto Suzuki, an expert on international politics at Hokkaido University. \"If you don't take care of yourself and become ill, that is taken as causing problems for other people.\"\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has resulted in the rigorous use of hand sanitisers and washing of hands, while not wearing a mask on the train would attract immediate disapproval.\n\nJapan's obsession with wearing masks predates Covid-19. Sales exploded during the 2009 H1N1 swine-flu outbreak. Mask sales for households are expected to reach \u00a535bn ($330m) this year, surpassing the 2009 peak of \u00a534bn, according to research firm Fuji Keizai.\n\nHong Kong's government has been one of the most proactive. The city suspended classes, closed most public facilities and told residents to avoid gatherings when the number of confirmed coronavirus cases was below 20.\n\nHong Kong has turned to a police \"supercomputer\" normally used to investigate complex crimes to trace potential supercarriers and hotspots in the city following its successful deployment during Sars. Health authorities also regularly update a map showing which buildings Covid-19 patients live in or last stayed at.\n\nResidents have strictly following expert advice to wash their hands and wear face masks, as the memories of Sars, which took almost 300 lives in the city, are fresh in their minds.\n\nBut nowhere have the lessons of Sars made as big a difference as in Taiwan. Seventy-three people died from Sars but, as a result of the isolation from international governing bodies demanded by China, it was largely left to its own devices.\n\nAfter the Sars epidemic calmed down, Prof Su -- who was then the director of Taiwan's CDC -- spent several months in the US to study its procedures, before returning in early 2004 to overhaul Taiwan's entire public health system.\n\nTaiwan reinforced its capacity by adding dozens of doctors to the staff of the CDC, more than 1,000 negative pressure rooms in hospitals and infectious diseases labs that can host viral testing.\n\n\"Previously, only the CDC did that, but during an outbreak they can't cope. So by enlisting labs at medical centres on a contractual basis, we now can test 2,400 people a day, and we can easily expand that capacity just by adding people,\" says Prof Su.\n\nTaiwan also built a logistics system with stockpiles of basic items -- including an inventory of 40m surgical masks.\n\nBut the biggest effect came on the political front in a country where politics is usually every bit as partisan as anything in Washington. After frequent quarrels and miscommunication between central and local governments during the Sars outbreak, Prof Su devised a unique management structure: infectious diseases specialists at medical centres across Taiwan are seconded to a body called the Central Epidemic Command Center, which is run out of CDC. The chair of the command centre has equal rank with government ministers. Medical professionals and government officials say the structure helps override politics and ensure a rapid response.\n\nThrough a sweeping legislative overhaul, Taiwan created a legal basis for limiting civil liberties under an epidemic and allowing it to fine those who violate quarantine rules.\n\nAll those reforms were tested during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009. \"It allowed us to spot things that didn't work, and many amendments were made since then,\" says Prof Chang.\n\nThe current epidemic has put the system fully to the test -- one that Taiwan appears so far to have passed. Although it has more frequent exchanges with China than almost any other country, with over 1m of its citizens living or working there and more than 2.7m Chinese visiting the island last year, Taiwan now ranks just 50th in terms of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide.\n\nTaipei was alerted to the outbreak in Wuhan early. In late December, health officials started screening passengers on flights arriving from the Chinese city before allowing them to disembark. On January 23 -- when the lockdown in Wuhan began -- Taipei suspended all flights to and from the city, barred Wuhan residents from entering the country and imposed daily health monitoring for people with respiratory symptoms who had arrived from anywhere in China.\n\nOn January 26, Taiwan became the first country to bar practically all Chinese citizens from entry.\n\nThe immigration and health insurance departments linked up their databases, allowing the government to spot people with higher risk of infection. As more information became available about transmission paths and incubation periods, Taipei tightened quarantine requirements. It also cast its net more widely by testing respiratory diseases patients for coronavirus who had tested negative for influenza -- an initiative that uncovered Taiwan's first local transmissions and helped stop them before a community spread developed.\n\nInternational experts praise the response. \"Taiwan is an example of how a society can respond quickly to a crisis and protect the interests of its citizens,\" concluded a group of US-based scholars in a paper published earlier this month.\n\nBut western governments do not appear to have taken much notice. \"Maybe there are some health experts hoping that we can help them with testing,\" says Prof Chang. \"But with regard to public health management, nobody has been in touch for advice.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType":

outside Oealrl\u00e9ans churns out lavishly coloured bottles of perfume for its Christian Dior brand: gold for J'Adore, deep purple for Poison, and candy pink for Miss Dior.\n\nBut in the early hours of Monday morning, something a bit less polished rolled off the production line: the first plastic bottles of hand sanitiser destined to be used by doctors and nurses in Paris hospitals on the front line of the battle against coronavirus.\n\nThe project came together at lightning speed, a mere 72 hours after the French government issued a call to industry on Friday to help fill gaps of key medical supplies as the spread of the virus accelerated. It showed how billionaire Bernard Arnault, who built LVMH into a luxury giant and France's biggest company, can marshal resources quickly and draw upon informal yet powerful networks of influence.\n\nThe 71-year-old tycoon greenlighted the effort on Saturday night in a brief text message to LVMH's general secretary Marc-Antoine Jamet, who had been liaising with health officials and staff internally all day as they raced to get a test batch approved.\n\nIt read simply: \"Excellent!!\"\n\nLVMH is on track to donate 12 tonnes of the hand sanitising gel to the 39 hospitals of the Paris system known as the APHP by the end of this week. It will also ramp up production with two additional production lines soon at the Givenchy factory in l'Oise and another for the Guerlain brand near Chartres.\n\n\"LVMH will continue to honour this commitment as long as necessary,\" said the company in a statement.\n\nThe move came as France entered shutdown on Monday and as cases of coronavirus were doubling every 72 hours, with more than 7,700 people diagnosed and 175 dead as of Wednesday morning. President Emmanuel Macron declared the country \"at war\".\n\nHow did LVMH, a sprawling conglomerate with 76 companies in its portfolio, manage to do this all so quickly?\n\nOne reason is the decisiveness of Arnault. Speaking of his boss, Jamet says: \"He bombards you with questions, and then goes off to think. It's a family-owned company with a guy at the top who makes decisions very quickly.\"\n\nAnother reason is cosmetics manufacturing is actually a close cousin to pharmacy, and the factory equipment could be quickly repurposed. Sanitising gel requires three main ingredients -- purified water, ethanol and glycerin -- all of which LVMH already had on hand.\n\nIn addition to perfumes, the Dior, Givenchy and Guerlain factories also make liquid soaps and moisturising creams for the brands. Those products are similar in viscosity to hand sanitising gel, so LVMH could use its usual filling machines, plastic bottles and pump dispensers. A tall metal tank at the Dior factory usually used to distill scent could be used to mix the ingredients, and a machine for filling up soap bottles drafted into packaging the gel.\n\nThe last thing that helped LVMH move quickly is that in a crisis, France turns out to be a pretty small place. The clich\u00e9 that the business and political elite cluster in the same Paris arrondissements, attend the same schools and socialise together exists for a reason.\n\n\"In the French system, we know all each other,\" says Martin Hirsch, a medical doctor and high-ranking civil servant who runs the APHP. \"It can be inconvenient in normal times, but it's great in a crisis.\"\n\nLVMH's Jamet first texted Hirsch last Saturday, offering to help make gel. The two had been friendly for years and first got to know each other from their days in L'\u00c9cole Nationale d'Administration -- the elite postgraduate institution. Hirsch was immediately receptive to the idea. Shortages of hand sanitiser had not yet cropped up in the hospitals that he oversaw but he knew that would not last long. \"We were not completely safe with the gel stocks and suppliers we had, so we were actually looking into whether we could make it ourselves,\" he recalls.\n\nHe sent his scientific adviser to the LVMH research facility that evening to check on whether their recipe would pass muster with regulators. The World Health Organization advises using an alcohol-based hand rub against coronavirus as an alternative when soap and water are not available. French regulators had issued guidelines but LVMH's recipe was slightly different so it had to be tested for efficacy and approved by the health minister.\n\nAgain, LVMH's network went into action. Jamet knew the health minister Olivier Veran from when the two had worked together on an industry charter to stop using runway models with very low body mass index. He called his office, and the ministry soon sent someone over to test the batches.\n\nBy 4am on Monday, the workers at the Dior perfume factory were set up and ready to go. The factory director Nicolas Ambolet surveyed his staffers as the production line began to run. \"Our whole team is very proud to rise to this challenge together,\" he said.\n\nOther French companies have also risen to the occasion, mirroring what happened in China and Italy, which were hit by the outbreak weeks earlier. At the APHP network, BNP Paribas donated 500,000 masks to Paris hospitals, while Renault has loaned out 300 cars for medical personnel to use. L'Or\u00e9al said on Wednesday it was also retooling factories from its La Roche-Posay and Garnier brands to make millions of units of hand sanitiser for nursing homes and hospitals.\n\nBut corporate philanthropy remains rare in a country dominated by the state, so it sometimes backfires when the billionaires swing into action. Arnault and Kering owner Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault faced criticism from some after they pledged to donate billions to help the reconstruction of Notre-Dame after last year's fire.\n\nThis time around, LVMH's charity has been well received. On Tuesday night, Romain de Jorna, a worker at Hospital Saint-Louis in Paris tweeted a photo of the bottle of LVMH hand sanitiser: \"Thank you\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The product is magnificent in every sense of the word!\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dior", "type": "wiki",

and YouTube to limit their services in order to prevent the continent's broadband networks from crashing as tens of millions of people start working from home.\n\nUntil now, telecoms companies have been bullish that internet infrastructure can withstand the drastic change in online behaviour brought about by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBut on Wednesday evening, Thierry Breton, one of the European commissioners in charge of digital policy, said streaming platforms and telecoms companies had a \"joint responsibility to take steps to ensure the smooth functioning of the internet\" during the crisis.\n\nThe EU said streaming platforms should consider offering only standard definition, rather than high-definition, programmes and users should be responsible about their data consumption.\n\nThere are worries that domestic broadband connections, which were designed to cope only with evening surges in traffic, may not be able to handle long days of adults engaging in video conferencing and children taking online classes or logging on to play games or watch movies.\n\nEU net neutrality laws forbid any throttling of entertainment services, such as Netflix or the games site Twitch, but a number of telecoms executives from across the continent said there was room for co-operation to safeguard the system.\n\n\"Our networks won't fall over without this, but it could get very congested,\" said one senior executive at a multinational telecoms group.\n\nAnother telecoms executive added that companies needed to mitigate \"Fortnite frenzy\", saying: \"Telcos are discussing ways to work alongside gaming businesses to make sure these events are planned for and managed, essentially flattening the connectivity curve.\"\n\nScott Petty, chief technology officer at Vodafone, which owns both a mobile and fixed network used by businesses in the UK, argued that \"peak hour\" in terms of traffic now stretched from about noon to 9pm.\n\nHe also pointed to \"aggressive\" offers from content streaming companies as being a further problem for the telecoms groups dealing with increases in traffic. Disney, for example, is set to launch its new streaming platform in the UK next week while Universal Pictures is launching its slate of new movies, including The Invisible Man and a new Trolls film, online to make up for the closure of cinemas.\n\nIn Italy, the first country to enact a full lockdown, there has been a three-fold increase in the use of video conferencing, which, alongside streaming and gaming, drove a 75 per cent rise in residential data traffic across broadband and mobile networks during the weekend, according to Telecom Italia.\n\n\"It is not a deluge that has swamped the network but it is a very large increase,\" said Johan Ottosson, the head of international business at the Swedish telecoms company Telia, who argued that new video games, such as Call of Duty, released this month, had not helped.\n\nThe Spanish telecoms industry issued a warning at the start of the week to urge consumers to ration their internet usage by streaming and downloading more in off-peak hours.\n\nIt also asked customers to use their old landline phones for voice calls to take the strain off mobile networks, which have seen a 50 per cent rise in the amount of data they are handling in recent days.\n\nIt is the mobile networks that have shown the most signs of strain. Data compiled by speed test company Ookla show that broadband speeds in China and Italy have held up but mobile networks have struggled.\n\nIn the UK, telecoms executives held a conference call last Thursday to discuss a fault that left hundreds of thousands of customers unable to connect calls to people on other mobile networks. The number of voice calls had risen 30 per cent rise and overloaded the systems.\n\nJohn Graham, chief technology officer at Cloudflare, the US web infrastructure company, said that while patterns of internet access were changing, there were yet to be signs of a significant global slowdown. \"[It] looks like there's enough capacity. Nothing to indicate that this will cause a problem,\" he said.\n\nMr Ottosson said that longer-term issues could, however, arise in the supply chain if equipment was harder to get, as well as in other unexpected ways, such as subcontractors not being able to access data centres to install or upgrade equipment including servers because of social-distancing laws. \"If those restrictions become too severe, then it makes our job a lot harder. We could be locked out,\" he said.\n\nA Netflix spokesperson acknowledged the potential issue but pointed to the existing tools it already provides to internet service providers, which allow them to store its library closer to customers, thereby easing some of the burden on the internet's backbone.\n\n\"Commissioner Breton is right to highlight the importance of ensuring that the internet continues to run smoothly during this critical time,\" the company said. \"We've been focused on network efficiency for many years, including providing our open connect service for free to telecommunications companies.\"\n\nNetflix's \"adaptive streaming\" technology also adjusted the resolution of a video according to available bandwidth in the home or local area, it added.\n\nYouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

committee offloaded as much as $1.7m in stock shortly before US markets crashed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nRichard Burr, a senator from North Carolina, sold between $628,033 and $1.72m worth of shares across 33 transactions on February 13, according to congressional disclosures.\n\nThe sales, first reported by ProPublica on Thursday evening, added to the pressure surrounding Mr Burr following criticism that he failed to do enough to warn the public about the looming coronavirus crisis despite knowing how dire the pandemic could be.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, NPR published a recording of Mr Burr telling attendees at a private dinner on February 27 that the coronavirus was akin to the 1918 influenza virus that killed tens of millions of people across the world.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr Burr said the share sales were \"personal transactions made several weeks before the US and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak\".\n\n\"As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nThe senator, who has said he will not run for re-election when his term expires in 2022, said on Twitter the NPR report was a \"tabloid-style hit piece\" that had \"misrepresented\" his speech.\n\nThe share sales Mr Burr disclosed came from accounts in his name or his spouse's and included stock in companies that have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The disclosures show sales of Wyndham Hotel & Resorts shares worth as much as $150,000.\n\nSince the disposals on February 13, Wyndham's share price has fallen by almost two-thirds.\n\nThe previous week, Mr Burr had sought to reassure the American public about the coronavirus in a op-ed co-authored with another Republican senator. \"Thankfully, the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats, like the coronavirus,\" he wrote on February 7.\n\nAs chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Mr Burr would have access to regular briefings by US intelligence agencies.
