It is not certain that the virus spreads from person to person.\n\nBut a few cases have not been linked to animals, and researchers say some human-to-human transmission may be possible. Related viruses, called SARS and MERS, have led to enormous, deadly outbreaks in recent years.\n\n\"This is a serious situation,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said.\n\nBut while there will probably be cases in the United States at some point, \"we believe the current risk from the virus to the general public is low,\" she added.\n\nThe CDC is also developing a diagnostic test that will be sent to hospitals and state health departments to determine whether people are infected.\n\nAbout 100 experts from the CDC are being deployed to the three airports. The first flight to be screened will arrive at New York's Kennedy International Airport on Friday night, Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine, said.\n\nJFK is the only airport in New York where the screening will take place. Screenings at San Francisco International and Los Angeles International will begin Saturday.\n\nOnly New York and San Francisco receive direct flights from Wuhan; passengers arriving in Los Angeles are on connecting flights.\n\nTravelers will be asked to fill out questionnaires asking if they have symptoms like a cough or a fever and whether they have visited meat and seafood markets in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nScreeners will also use thermal scanners that can be pointed at the forehead or temple to look for fever. People with signs of illness will be examined further, along with family members or others traveling with them.\n\nThose who seem likely to be infected with the virus will be sent to area hospitals for further testing and treatment.\n\nThe screening could take time, Cetron said, and some passengers may miss connecting flights.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "denise_grady@nytimes.com", "name": "Denise Grady", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Three are now in critical condition, the commission said.\n\nThe new cases suggest that the illness, which has killed two people and sickened at least 62 in China, is continuing to spread. Public health officials are working to stop a major outbreak of the virus ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people in China are expected to travel. The holiday begins Friday.\n\nAlready, the virus appears to have spread outside China's borders. Officials in Thailand and Japan have confirmed three cases involving people who have traveled through Wuhan.\n\nThe authorities said that most people with the infection had contracted it through exposure to animals at a market in Wuhan that sells seafood and live animals, and it was uncertain whether the virus could spread from human to human.\n\nBut the health commission in Wuhan also acknowledged on Sunday that some people who had come down with the virus had no exposure to the market.\n\nThat acknowledgment suggest that the virus could be present in other markets in Wuhan, experts said, raising concerns that more people might be at risk.\n\n\"If you cannot find the source and control the source of the virus, you cannot extinguish the fire,\" said David Hui, the director of the Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nDr. Hui said the risk of human-to-human transmission still appeared to be low, though he noted that the virus could mutate.\n\nSome experts have suggested that there are most likely far more cases of the illness than the authorities have disclosed. In previous incidents, including during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, the Chinese government has withheld critical information, drawing widespread criticism.\n\nOne estimate on Friday by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggested that there could be as many as 1,700 cases.\n\nThe new virus has brought back memories in China of the SARS outbreak, which was also caused by a coronavirus. That virus, which is believed to have jumped to humans from animals at markets, originated in China and was spread to other countries by travelers, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 800.\n\nWhile the new coronavirus so far seems to be less severe than SARS, public health officials around the world are exercising caution.\n\nOn Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States announced that airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles would begin screening passengers from Wuhan for the virus.\n\nElsie Chen contributed research.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "javier_c_hernandez@nytimes.com", "name": "Javier C.

The man, who was a resident of Kanagawa Prefecture, had returned to Japan on Jan. 6 after traveling to the Chinese central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. The man was hospitalized on Jan. 10, but was discharged five days later because he had recovered, according to the health ministry.\n\nJapan's health ministry said the patient had not visited any seafood markets in China. The World Health Organization had said it was highly likely that the virus had spread from a seafood market in Wuhan, which also sold live fish, animals and birds.\n\n\"It is possible that the patient had close contact with an unknown patient with lung inflammation while in China,\" Japan's health ministry said in a statement.\n\nIt was the second confirmed case of the new coronavirus reported outside China in the last week. In Thailand, authorities also detected the country's first case on Monday in a 61-year-old Chinese woman.\n\nDr. Sopon Iamsirithaworn, director of the communicable diseases division at Thailand's public health ministry, said the woman also had not visited the seafood market. However, the doctor said that the woman went to a smaller wet market near where she lives.\n\nThe woman who tested positive is in good health now, according to Dr. Suthat Chottanapund, a senior official of the disease control department from Thailand's health ministry. But he said health authorities are waiting until the labs confirm that she is free from the coronavirus before discharging her. She said she wanted to do some sightseeing after she is discharged, he said.\n\nThe revelations that both patients in Japan and Thailand had not visited any seafood markets are troubling signs that the outbreak could be spreading beyond people who had contact with the market.\n\nAlarm is growing across the region after Chinese health authorities said in late December that a new mysterious virus had caused dozens of people to fall ill in Wuhan. The Wuhan health commission said on Wednesday that the risk of a rapid spread of the virus among humans is low but it could not rule out the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus. Officials also said they detected the first cluster of the virus involving members of a family.\n\nThe World Health Organization has reiterated that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus.\n\nWhile the new coronavirus appears to be less virulent and deadly than the virus that caused the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, many questions remain. Experts say they want to know how the virus was transmitted to humans and the incubation period of the patients. The last case in China was detected Jan. 3. and the minimum incubation period for some viral infections is 15 days, suggesting that it may be a few more days before authorities can determine the full extent of the illness.\n\nThat has fueled concerns among governments across the region, especially ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins next week, a time when hundreds of millions of people in China travel.\n\nBen Dooley contributed reporting from Tokyo.
