A United States citizen died from the coronavirus in Wuhan, the provincial capital, American officials said on Saturday.\n\nThe SARS epidemic, which also began in China, killed 774 people worldwide. There have been only two confirmed deaths from the new coronavirus outside mainland China: one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.\n\nMany doctors believe that deaths and infections from the current epidemic are undercounted in China because testing facilities are under severe strain.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 40,500 people in China and 24 other countries.\n\nAfter a long break, China slowly returns to work.\n\nSome Chinese businesses resumed work on Monday, the end of an extended Lunar New Year holiday intended to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 5, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus, and how dangerous is it?\n\nRead up on the respiratory virus, including its symptoms and how it is transmitted. How bad could the outbreak be?\n\nHere are the six key factors that will determine whether it can be contained. Where has the virus spread?\n\nYou can track its movement with this map. How is the United States being affected?\n\nThere have been at least a dozen cases. American citizens and permanent residents who fly to the United States from China are now subject to a two-week quarantine. What if I'm traveling?\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, have discouraged travel to China, and several airlines have canceled flights. Many travelers have been left in limbo while looking to change or cancel bookings. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands is the most important thing you can do.\n\nBut in many large cities, the outbreak continues to disrupt daily life. Across the country, teeming cities are effectively locked down, schools have been closed for weeks, trains and flights canceled.\n\nThe Hong Kong International Airport, one of the world's busiest, was eerily empty on Sunday. Cathay Pacific, the city's flag carrier, said last week that it would force employees to take three-week unpaid furloughs.\n\nParents in the territory and elsewhere across China, including Shanghai and Guangdong, scrambled to find child care after schools announced they would continue to remain closed for the month of February even as many workers were told to return to their jobs on Monday.\n\nIn Beijing, the city's typically teeming subway, had far fewer riders on Monday and train cars were largely empty.\n\nThe W.H.O. may soon be able to help in China.\n\nCui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, said Sunday that experts from the World Health Organization would be allowed into China \"very soon\" to assist with the coronavirus outbreak, and the agency's chief announced hours later that an advance team was on its way.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director general, posted a message on Twitter from Geneva saying that he had \"just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team\" of experts led by Dr. Bruce Aylward.\n\nDr. Aylward, a W.H.O. assistant director general, was the organization's special representative for the 2014 Ebola outbreak.\n\nOffers of assistance from the W.H.O. and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been ignored for weeks, The Times reported Friday, but the moves on Sunday appeared to signal that Beijing would at least partly reverse course.\n\n\"We are coordinating with the World Health Organization,\" Mr. Cui said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"I'm sure that they will be going to China very soon.\"\n\nHe declined to say if a team of experts from the C.D.C. would also be allowed into China, suggesting instead that American experts could be admitted as part of the W.H.O. or as individuals.\n\n\"American experts are on the list recommended by the W.H.O.,\" Mr. Cui said. \"Even beyond that, some American experts have come to China already on their own individual basis.\"",

"Pangolins Are Suspected as a Potential Coronavirus Host", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn the search for the animal source or sources of the coronavirus epidemic in China, the latest candidate is the pangolin, an endangered, scaly, ant-eating mammal that is imported in huge numbers to Chinese markets for food and medicine.\n\nThe market in pangolins is so large that is said to be the most trafficked mammal on the planet. All four Asian species are critically endangered, and it is far from clear whether being identified as a viral host would be good or bad for pangolins. It could decrease the trade in the animals, or cause a backlash.\n\nIt is also far from clear whether the pangolin is the animal that passed the new virus to humans. Bats are still thought to be the original host of the virus. If pangolins are involved in disease transmission, they would act as an intermediate host. The science so far is suggestive rather than conclusive, and because of the intense interest in the virus, some claims have been made public before the traditional scientific review process.\n\nAs a result, some researchers who specialize in studying diseases that spill over from animals to humans have expressed frustration about conducting discussions about scientific claims without the life breath of science: publicly available data and accounts of how the research was done that have been vetted by other scientists.\n\nWhile scientists wait for details on genetic studies, there is a gaping hole in the more mundane, but equally important, detective work involved in tracking the path of a disease. To be certain of what happened with the new virus, researchers need to know exactly which animals were present in the market in Wuhan which may have been instrumental in the spread of the disease.\n\nThe virus was found in people associated with the market, and in the market environment -- on surfaces, for instance, or in cages. However, some of the early cases, including what might have been the first reported case, were in people who were not associated with the market. Jon Epstein, vice president for science and outreach at EcoHealth Alliance in New York, said this means the first jump from animals to humans may not have occurred in the marketplace. People may have contracted the disease from animals at another location or earlier, as yet unknown cases may have contracted the disease at the market and passed it on to other people.\n\nFurther complicating matters, animals at the Wuhan market seem to have been quickly disposed of, although reports from China were that samples from those animals tested negative for the virus.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\n\"That's the black box we have, what animals were there, what animals involved,\" said Dr. Epstein.\n\nIn previous coronavirus outbreaks, SARS in China in 2003 and MERS in Saudi Arabia in 2012, interviews with people who had contact with animal hosts were essential to finding the source, Dr. Epstein said.\n\nPalm civets turned out to be an intermediate host of SARS and camels an intermediate host of MERS. In both outbreaks, researchers eventually found that the origin of the virus was in bats, where the virus could live without sickening the animals. From bats, the viruses seem to have jumped to intermediate hosts and then to people.\n\nAn earlier indication that pangolins could be a possible source of human coronavirus infection appeared in a report that predates the epidemic. Chinese researchers published a report in October that documented that pangolins can host a variety of coronaviruses. They released the genetic sequences from their analysis to public databases where they could be analyzed.\n\nThen, on Friday, the Xinhua News Agency reported that researchers at South China Agricultural University had found a virus in pangolins that had a 99 percent match to the novel coronavirus that has now sickened 40,000 people and killed more than 900. That would be the closest match so far.\n\nThe news report did not say the finding was conclusive, but that the result means \"pangolins may be an intermediate host of the virus.\" Scientists in the field are eagerly awaiting publication of the findings, and until then, they are impossible to evaluate.\n\nIn addition, a post on the website Virological, suggested that a coronavirus from bats could have recombined with one from pangolins to form the new virus.\n\nJoseph Petrosino, at Baylor College of Medicine, said Matthew Wong, a bio-informatician in his lab, posted an analysis he had done. Dr. Petrosino said he expected the work to be posted on bioRxiv shortly and that he and his colleagues have submitted it to a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nIn essence, he said, data mining of genomic data posted in the last 12 months -- most importantly the October report on pangolins -- indicated that a portion of a coronavirus in pangolins was nearly identical to one in the new virus. That portion involves the way that the virus invades human cells. Therefore, they propose, the bat virus and pangolin virus may have combined, perhaps in pangolins in the wild, perhaps in another animal.\n\nDr. Petrosino said he's eager for the peer review process, but the intensity of attention to the new virus made public discussion somewhat inevitable. The website Virological, he said, is like \"Twitter for geeks,\" not a place where news is usually made. His lab's research was first reported in the Daily Maverick, a South African news site.\n\nWhat might have been early hints of hypotheses or preliminary findings in another context now attract global attention. CITES, the international organization that lists endangered species, tweeted that #Pangolins may have spread #coronavirus to humans.\"\n\nThat drew a response from Hume Field, science and policy adviser for EcoHealth Alliance in Australia, who worked on both SARS and MERS. He responded\n\n\"I appreciate CITES genuine concern for pangolins and the devastating illegal trade, but to seek to further their cause by propagating this unsubstantiated news release only adds to confusion and rumor.\"\n\nPublic databases enable any lab, anywhere, to investigate and analyze genetic sequences published for bat and pangolin coronaviruses, and hypothesize what may have happened.\n\nBenjamin Neumann, chairman of the biology department at Texas A&M University, is one of the scientists who have been looking at the sequences in his lab and talking to other scientists examining them. \"Similar analyses are taking place in labs around the world right now,\" he said.\n\nBut, he said, \"While the pangolin-associated viruses appear to be related to the novel coronavirus that is infecting people, it is not yet the smoking gun that tells us how 2019-nCoV originated.\" That's what the virus causing the epidemic is called.\n\nHe pointed out that the pangolins could have been infected by the same virus that sickens humans, but be just another victim rather than the source.\n\nDetermining the transmission of a virus from an animal to a human requires much more information, Dr. Epstein said.\n\nHe said, \"The smoking gun here is finding people who were healthy before they were handling pangolins, or any other animal. They handled the animal, they got sick after they handled the animal, and the same virus that made them sick was present in the animal they handled.\"\n\nCoincidentally, this Saturday, Feb. 15, is

"title": "China's Powerful Growth Engine Idles as Coronavirus Spreads", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWorkers are stuck in their hometowns. Officials want detailed health plans before factories or offices can reopen. Assembly lines that make General Motors cars and Apple iPhones are standing silent.\n\nMore than two weeks after China locked down a major city to stop a dangerous viral outbreak, one of the world's largest economies remains largely idle. Much of the country was supposed to have reopened by now, but its empty streets, quiet factories and legions of inactive workers suggest that weeks or months could pass before this vital motor of global growth is humming again.\n\nGlobal growth could suffer the longer China stays in low gear. It has been hampered by both the outbreak and its own containment efforts, a process that has cut off workers from their jobs and factories from their raw materials. The result is a slowdown that is already slashing traffic along the world's shipping lines and leading to forecasts of a sharp fall in production of everything from cars to smartphones.\n\n\"It's like Europe in medieval times,\" said Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, \"where each city has its checks and crosschecks.\"\n\nNew figures show the authorities still have a long way to go before the outbreak can be tamed. On Monday, the authorities reported the most deaths from the new coronavirus in a single day, raising the death toll by 97 to 908.\n\nIn a sign that China's leaders feel increasing pressure to look like they are in control, Xi Jinping, the country's top leader, toured a Beijing neighborhood and hospital, in what state media described as an inspection of the front line of the outbreak. Chinese officials have been roundly criticized online even in the face of tough censorship for what many see as a slow initial response and the suppression of early warnings.\n\nOn Monday, a team from the World Health Organization landed in Beijing to work with Chinese researchers battling the coronavirus. Their arrival could signal a shift in attitude among China's leaders, who had balked at a visit and have long worked to show that they do not need foreign assistance to tackle problems.\n\nThe organization's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited with concern instances of infections among people who had not traveled to China, suggesting that even more cases could emerge. \"In short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nChinese health officials have been encouraged that the pace of recoveries among victims has outpaced deaths for more than a week. The rate of infection, however, has continued to soar, suggesting that the worst is still to come.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that restarting China -- the world's largest manufacturer and a titan of global trade -- would be difficult even if the country makes major strides in the next few days toward containing the outbreak.\n\nUntil then, the damage is spreading.\n\nOn Monday, Nissan of Japan said it would shut down its plant in Kyushu, Japan, for four days beginning later this week \"due to supply shortages of parts from China.\" Other carmakers like FCA in Italy and Hyundai in South Korea have already warned that a lack of parts from China could force them to curtail production in their home markets.\n\nThe China Development Forum, the country's premier gathering of business leaders and economists, said its annual meeting, set for next month, had been postponed indefinitely.\n\nGovernment officials had extended China's official Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 3 to keep people home. Major business hubs, like the cities of Beijing and Shanghai and the provinces of Guangdong and Shandong, then further extended holidays until Monday.\n\nAs the day dawned, it was clear that business as usual had not resumed. Traffic in Beijing was much lighter than normal, stores remained closed and many residents worked from home or did not work at all.\n\nMajor companies said their factories remained closed or were running slower than usual. Ford Motor said that its joint venture with one of China's biggest state-owned firms was restarting some production, but that it would \"ramp up our production over the following weeks.\"\n\nGeneral Motors said that it would reopen the first of its huge assembly plants in China only on Saturday, and would gradually reopen the rest over the following two weeks, \"based on local employees' safety readiness, supply chain readiness and product inventory needs.\"\n\nChina's containment efforts are contributing to the disruptions.\n\nThe authorities have locked down a region of central China around Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. The local authorities are taking a tough stance with traffic, meaning workers are struggling to return to their jobs. Many towns and cities have begun imposing two-week mandatory quarantines on arriving truck drivers who picked up cargos in cities with disease outbreaks or even just drove through these areas.\n\nWu Lin, an associate director at a Shanghai advertising company, returned to Wuhan, her hometown, for the holidays on Jan. 21 and had a high-speed train ticket back to Shanghai on Feb. 2. But her ticket was canceled soon after Wuhan was locked down and she has tried and failed repeatedly since then to find a way out.\n\n\"There is no point to keep looking,\" she said.\n\nShipyards around the country have run into labor shortages, said Tim Huxley, the chief executive of Mandarin Shipping, a Hong Kong freighter shipping company. Shipbuilders and ship repair providers have begun citing these labor shortages to invoke clauses in their contracts that allow them to delay completion of projects for events beyond their control, he said.\n\nAside from fear of disease, the country's nearly 300 million migrant workers -- almost two fifths of the labor force -- now have another reason to be reluctant to travel to distant cities: Their children are still home. Depending on the province, many schools are not scheduled to resume until Feb. 25 or even March 1.\n\nEven factories with enough workers are running into further problems. The packaging industry is almost shut down, so everything from plastic packing to steel drums is running out, said Mr. Wuttke.\n\nLocal regulators are putting up even more barriers.\n\nBefore businesses in big manufacturing hubs like Shanghai, Shenzhen, Suzhou or Nanjing can reopen, they must now verify the travel history and health of every employee over the past two weeks. They must have frequent temperature checks of employees, hand-washing procedures and a plan to isolate and refer to hospitals anyone showing even fevers as low as 99.1 degrees.\n\nMost difficult of all, businesses cannot reopen without prior approval of their health plans by municipal officials -- and larger operations also have to wait for a site visit from a health official.\n\nShenzhen, a vast sprawl of electronics factories and skyscrapers next to Hong Kong, issued new health and safety rules on Sunday and said that factories that make iPhones and other Apple products would have to meet them before opening. Foxconn Technology, a Taiwanese company that owns the factories, said it met all health and hygiene rules but declined to comment on when production would restart at specific locations. Apple declined to comment.\n\nApple's iPhone production, which is heavily concentrated in China, could drop by 10 percent in the first three months of the year, projected TrendForce, a Taiwan-based technology forecasting firm.\n\nThe municipal government in Shanghai, home to more than 20 million people and a vast array of businesses, said that only 70 percent of the city's manufacturers were taking steps to resume production. Few have actually received permission to do so.\n\nBusinesses \"want to protect staff, but also nobody wants to get caught offsides when it comes to the labor law or the daily announcements from the government,\" said Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\n\nIt is not yet clear how the ripples from China's slowdown will affect the United States. Businesses that rely on assembling a lot of different parts from various suppliers could become the hardest hit. At the top of that list is the auto industry -- a single car may require as many as 30,000 parts from various suppliers.\n\nAmerican businesses have been trying to diversify away from China as President Trump's trade war with Beijing has made it less economical to manufacture there. But a lot of steering parts, electronics and even door hinges still come to the United States from China, said Razat Gaurav, the chief executive of Llamasoft, a company in Ann Arbor, Mich., that handles supply chain logistics for big automakers and aerospace companies in North America.\n\n\"If the current coronavirus crisis continues to impact production capacity in China,\" he said, \"it will ultimately impact auto assembly plants in the U.S. and Mexico.\"\n\nBen Dooley and Raymond Zhong contributed reporting, and Cao Li contributed research.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

Experts Worry as a Germ-Phobic Trump Confronts a Growing Epidemic", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- When an outbreak of the Ebola virus touched the United States' shores in mid-2014, Donald J. Trump was still a private citizen. But he had strong opinions about how America should act.\n\nMr. Trump, who has spoken openly about his phobia of germs, closely followed the epidemic, and offered angry commentary about what he said was the Obama administration's dangerous response. He demanded draconian measures like canceling flights, forcing quarantines and even denying the return of American medical workers who had contracted the disease in Africa.\n\n\"Ebola patient will be brought to the U.S. in a few days -- now I know for sure that our leaders are incompetent. KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!\" Mr. Trump tweeted on that July 31 after learning that one American medical worker would be evacuated to Atlanta from Liberia. \"The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back,\" Mr. Trump wrote the next day, adding: \"People that go to far away places to help out are great -- but must suffer the consequences!\"\n\nIn nearly 50 tweets, as well as in appearances on Fox News and other networks, Mr. Trump supported flight bans and strict quarantines and branded President Barack Obama's deployment of troops to West Africa to fight the disease as \"morally unfair.\"\n\nMany health experts called Mr. Trump's responses extreme, noting that the health workers would have most likely faced agonizing deaths had they not been evacuated to American hospitals. Former Obama administration officials said his commentary stoked alarmism in the news media and spread fear among the public.\n\nNow Mr. Trump confronts another epidemic in the form of the coronavirus, this time at the head of the country's health care and national security agencies. The illness has infected few people in the United States, but health officials fear it could soon spread more widely. And while Mr. Trump has so far kept his distance from the issue, public health experts worry that his extreme fear of germs, disdain for scientific and bureaucratic expertise and suspicion of foreigners could be a dangerous mix, should he wind up overseeing a severe outbreak at home.\n\n\"Having a head of state who is trusted, who is a credible message deliverer, consistent in communications and consistent with evidence, is absolutely necessary,\" said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"There's so much misinformation out there, so a central role is for a leader to be a go-to source for credible information.\"\n\nFor the most part, Mr. Trump has been uncharacteristically restrained in his commentary about the virus, delegating the response to senior health officials.\n\nAt the end of January, Mr. Trump created a 12-member coronavirus task force, which will be managed by the National Security Council. It includes the health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II; Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health; and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak How Is the U.S. Being Affected?\n\nUpdated Feb.10, 2020\n\nTwelve cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the United States, including a 35-year-old man in Washington State, a couple in their 60s in Chicago and six people in California. If you live in California, here's what this means for you. Pittsburgh, Wuhan's \"sister city,\" has been shaken by the outbreak and is sending aid to relatives and friends trapped in the center of a deadly outbreak. Hundreds of Americans evacuated from Wuhan arrived on military bases, where they were expected to remain in quarantine for days. Hundreds of Americans who recently traveled to China are isolating themselves in 'self quarantines' for 14 days. There was a race to contain the disease after one man's cough became confirmation of America's first case. A high school exchange student may have been among the last Americans to arrive home in time to avoid the mandated quarantine. Mask hoarders may increase the risk of an outbreak in the U.S. Health care workers risk infection if they cannot get the protective gear. Most experts agree: To protect yourself wash your hands and avoid touching your face. Tips to not get sick while traveling. Affected by travel? Or do you know someone who is? Please contact us at coronavirus@nytimes.com if you are willing to be contacted by a reporter or have your comments used for a coming story.\n\nAll three have experience dealing with infectious diseases, especially Mr. Fauci, who has helped to manage the response to numerous outbreaks, including the AIDS epidemic, the SARS virus and Ebola.\n\nIn many of his remarks he has made, Mr. Trump has praised President Xi Jinping of China, even though his government has been widely criticized for a clumsy and initially secretive response to the coronavirus, and made some questionable announcements.\n\n\"They're working really hard, and I think they're doing a very professional job,\" Mr. Trump said on Friday.\n\nSpeaking to a meeting of the nation's governors on Monday, he predicted that the virus will have run its course by spring and again referred to the Chinese president.\n\n\"The virus that we're talking about having to do, a lot of people think that goes away in April, with the heat, as the heat comes in, typically that will go away in April,\" Mr. Trump said. Referring to the United States, he added: \"We're in great shape, though. We have 12 cases, 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now.\" (The number of confirmed cases is 12, according to a Monday update by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)\n\n\"I had a long talk with President Xi two nights ago,\" he added. \"He feels very confident. He feels that again, as I mentioned, by April or during the month of April, the heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus. So that would be a good thing.\"\n\nPublic health experts questioned the speculative nature of his comments. \"I think there is a lot we still don't know about this virus, and I'm not sure we can say definitively that it will dissipate with warmer weather,\" said Dr. Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University.\n\n\"Relying on the fact that it's going to warm up in April as reassurance that the virus will be controlled by then I think is arguable,\" added Dr. James M. Hughes, a professor emeritus of medicine at Emory University.\n\nOther comments from Mr. Trump about the disease have been inaccurate or met with criticism. In late January, he wrote on Twitter that five coronavirus cases had been confirmed in the United States just hours after a sixth had been confirmed. Addressing the virus on Feb. 2, Mr. Trump boasted to Fox News, \"We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.\"\n\nThe words \"shut it down\" apparently referred to an executive order the president had issued two days earlier, barring entry to the United States by foreign citizens who traveled to China in the past two weeks. Some health experts worry that Mr. Trump overpromised because the order -- which the White House announced abruptly, with little outside consultation -- is unlikely to prevent the illness from reaching the United States, and federal health officials say they assume the number of cases in the United States is likely to increase.\n\nSpeaking at a Friday news briefing, Mr. Azar defended the president's actions and said the new travel restrictions were \"very measured and incremental\" while praising Mr. Trump's \"aggressive\" response overall.\n\nPresidential words have played an important role in past health crises. Ronald Reagan was severely criticized for his slow response to the spread of H.I.V. and for recommending abstinence to address the infection. Mr. Obama resisted pressure from Mr. Trump and others to institute sweeping travel bans and quarantines, calling them alarmist and urging levelheaded thinking.\n\n\"This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear because that only makes it harder to get people the accurate information they need,\" Mr. Obama said in October 2014 in a radio address. \"We have to be guided by the science. We have to remember the basic facts.\"\n\nMr. Trump's record on presenting facts has been a persistent source of criticism in the scientific community. The last time the White House became involved in managing a national emergency, during Hurricane Dorian in September, he misstated an official forecast of the storm's path, then displayed a tracking map in the Oval Office that he appeared to have altered with one of his signature Sharpie pens.\n\n\"Trump has the right people, but the wrong instincts and the wrong structure,\" said Ronald Klain, who directed the Obama administration's response to the 2014 Ebola crisis. \"Our government is staffed with the best experts, scientists and medical leaders in the world. But Trump's instincts -- anti-science, anti-expert, isolationist and xenophobic -- risk that he will eschew that advice at critical points.\"\n\nAnother factor is Mr. Trump's lifelong obsession with personal hygiene. While he has shown little interest in health or science policy, he has often spoken of his extreme revulsion to germs.\n\nIn his 2004 book, \"How to Get Rich,\" the president declared himself \"very much of a germophobe,\" and wrote that he was \"waging a personal crusade to replace the mandatory and unsanitary handshake with the Japanese custom of bowing.\"\n\nAs a result, Mr. Trump generally avoids the political tradition of shaking dozens of hands after his speeches and rallies, and frequently uses hand sanitizer. He is quick to banish aides who cough and sneeze in his presence. In a January 2017 interview, the president's personal physician, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, said Mr. Trump always \"changes the paper himself\" in the examining room.\n\nIn that regard, Mr. Trump may have gained at least a temporary ally in Mr. Xi. Mingling for the cameras with Beijing residents Monday, Mr. Xi, who sported a surgical mask, recommended they skip the customary form of greeting. \"Let's not shake hands in this special time,\" he said.\n\nLawrence K.

Monday Briefing", "body": "Good morning.\n\nWe're covering global spread of the coronavirus, a depleted lower Mekong and turmoil at the Justice Department.\n\nRising concern that coronavirus will slip world's net\n\nThe number of reported coronavirus cases stood at more than 68,500, with nearly 1,700 deaths, including a man in Taiwan with no history of travel to mainland China. Here's the latest.\n\nThough the pace of increase has slowed, there are new fears of global transmission after an 83-year-old American woman tested positive for the coronavirus in Malaysia. She was one of more than 1,000 passengers who left a cruise ship last week in Cambodia and traveled onward to other destinations.\n\nIn Japan, some American passengers are being evacuated from another cruise ship that now has 355 confirmed coronavirus cases. Canada and Hong Kong say they will also evacuate their nationals from the ship, and Australia is sending an expert to weigh options.\n\nOfficials in Hawaii are racing to find people who may have had contact with a tourist couple who tested positive for the coronavirus after returning home to Japan.\n\nIn China: Placing himself in the middle of questions about the government's response, President Xi Jinping said in a new speech that he took charge of the outbreak in early January, nearly two weeks before he first spoke publicly about it and when the government was still saying human-to-human spread seemed unlikely.\n\nA Mao-style containment has imposed lockdowns of varying strictness on at least 760 million people, according to our analysis, a major blow to the world's second largest economy.\n\nAnother angle: Although there are only a handful of known cases in the U.S., the outbreak has some Asian-Americans feeling an unnerving public scrutiny for just sneezing.\n\nAdjusting to life in a fire-scarred Australia\n\nThe wildfires that ravaged the country are changing what it means to be Australian.\n\n\"In a land usually associated with relaxed optimism, anxiety and trauma have taken hold,\" our Sydney bureau chief writes in an analysis. And summers are only set to get hotter and smokier, promising humming air filters and children kept indoors.\n\nAs Australians stumble toward new ways of work, leisure and life, our bureau chief asks, will a conservative government skeptical of climate change follow?\n\nOn the ground: Fires are still burning south and west of New South Wales. In total, tens of millions of acres have been incinerated.\n\nBehind U.S.-Iran clash: months of misjudgments\n\nA nine-month period that shook up the already tense relationship between the two countries began with the Trump administration's escalation of sanctions and ended with Washington and Tehran in a direct military confrontation.\n\nOur reporters traced the path to last month's violent standoff, finding a story of miscalculations by both sides.\n\nWhat's next? \"The chess match continues,\" our reporters write. The Senate tried to constrain President Trump, voting last week to require that he seek congressional authorization before taking further military action against Iran. But the measure lacked the support needed to override a promised veto.\n\nAnother player: Once based in Iraq, a secretive group of celibate Iranian dissidents -- the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Jihadists -- gave our reporter a tour of their new home in Albania.\n\nSri Lankan army chief banned from U.S.\n\nThe U.S. imposed an entry bar on Sri Lanka's army chief, Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva, citing his alleged involvement in war crimes during the final stages of the country's civil war.\n\nThe ban is the first significant international penalty against Sri Lanka since it brought the 26-year civil war to a bloody close against Tamil Tiger militants in 2009. Some 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed during the war, and thousands who surrendered to General Silva's division disappeared.\n\nSri Lanka's government condemned the U.S. measure and said there were \"no substantiated or proven allegations\" against General Silva, but rights groups and some in the country applauded the move.\n\nLooking ahead: The American penalty may spur other countries to impose similar measures, or raise pressure on Sri Lanka to pursue its own war crimes tribunals -- though there are signs that the country is taking an illiberal turn under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\n\nIf you have 8 minutes, this is worth itA vital river runs low\n\nThe lower Mekong, which runs through five countries and serves as a lifeline for 60 million people, was one of the world's few remaining free rivers until a Thai-funded dam started operations in November. Now the river is choked, residents told our reporter, and some parts are reduced to a trickle.\n\n\"Our nets are almost empty,\" a fisherman in Thailand said. \"Maybe our way of life on the river is finished.\"\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nU.S. Justice Department: More than 1,100 former federal prosecutors and justice officials called on Attorney General William Barr to step down and some current prosecutors are expressing concerns about political interference in light of his intervention in the case involving Roger Stone, a friend of President Trump's.\n\nU.S.-China trade: As the Trump administration considers whether to block transactions between U.S. and Chinese firms and otherwise restrict technology exports to China, some big U.S. tech firms are warning that tougher rules could be disastrous for their business, locking them out of world markets.\n\nSnapshot: Above, flooding in Tenbury Wells, England. More than half a month's worth of rain fell in one day as a \"weather bomb\" brought chaos to parts of England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nMichael Bloomberg: As he eyed a presidential run, the billionaire and former New York mayor ramped up his charitable giving. His money created an unmatched empire of influence.\n\nWhat we're reading: This essay by the writer and critic Paraic O'Donnell in The Irish Times. Steven Erlanger, our diplomatic correspondent in Europe, describes it as a \"moving, sometimes angry contemplation of a life slowly destroyed by M.S., bringing thoughts of how gardens are born in destruction, and how this progressive disease moves with the seasons.\"\n\nNow, a break from the news\n\nCook: Roasted salmon with fennel and lime is elegant and supremely easy.\n\nRead: \"Run Me to Earth,\" by Paul Yoon, is a meditation on the devastating nature of war and displacement that begins under a hail of American firepower in war-torn 1960s Laos. It's one of 10 new books we recommend.\n\nSmarter Living: We have guidance on how to be a supportive partner during pregnancy (and beyond), which is good for everyone involved, including the baby.\n\nAnd now for the Back Story on ...Russia's radio reach\n\nLast week we reported that Radio Sputnik, a propaganda arm of the Russian government, is now broadcasting on three Kansas City-area radio stations. In a modern spin on propaganda, it focuses on sowing doubt about Western governments and institutions.\n\nNeil MacFarquhar, our national correspondent who wrote the story, previously served as the Times bureau chief in Moscow. We talked with him in the following conversation, which has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nYou wrote that one Sputnik station shares a frequency with a smaller jazz station in Kansas City. What's it like to be listening to Charlie Parker one minute, and propaganda the next?\n\nYou get roughly, \"This is Radio Sputnik, broadcasting live from Washington D.C., the capital of the divided states of America.\"\n\nThe station that has the Sputnik frequency is fairly strong, while the station broadcasting jazz is relatively weak. If you're by the more powerful transmitter, you get Radio Sputnik\n\nIs this kind of propaganda relatively unprecedented in U.S.-Russian relations?\n\nIt depends on your interpretation of \"propaganda.\" There have previously been radio broadcasts of foreign- owned and financed radio stations into the United States.\n\nBut part of the change is the MORE SOUR mood between the two capitals. Under Putin, there has been a much more concerted effort to undermine Western institutions.\n\nThe Facebook campaigns focused on the 2016 election and other things we've heard about were direct attempts to influence specific groups of people, so it was more manipulative. This is much more subtle. It's not old-school propaganda, it's American hosts -- before they got to Sputnik they were fairly down on the United States from the left or right -- trying to paint the U.S. as damaged goods.\n\nIs it jarring compared to other radio stations on the dial?\n\nIt's talk radio, so they're riffing off of headlines about impeachment, Kobe Bryant, coronavirus, that kind of thing. The bureau chief in Washington says they'd like to have a station in New York but the cost is bigger than their budget allows.\n\nThat's it for this briefing. See you next time.\n\n-- Penn\n\nThank you\n\nTo Mark Josephson and Eleanor Stanford for the break from the news. Adam Pasick, on the briefings team, wrote today's Back Story. You can reach the team at briefing@nytimes.com.\n\nP.S.\n\n* We're listening to \"The Daily.\" Our latest episode is about the post-impeachment President Trump.\n\n* Here's our Mini Crossword, and a clue: Zip, zero, nada (four letters). You can find all our puzzles here.\n\n* A. G. Sulzberger, the Times's publisher, recently received an award from the New England First Amendment.

A woman told us that her mother was on board and feverish -- but hadn't been seen by doctors.\n\nHere are the latest updates and maps of where the virus has spread.\n\n\"Let's not shake hands in this special time,\" said President Xi Jinping of China as he reappeared in public in a show of leadership. Much of China remains idle, its economy frozen. Though the country faces stigma for being at the center of some of the world's biggest viral epidemics, its health system has made strides.\n\nCloser look: While the world's most trafficked mammal, the pangolin, may be involved in the outbreak, the evidence is far from clear.\n\nQuenching South Korea's thirst for Oscar glory\n\nThe success of \"Parasite\" at the Academy Awards led to an outpouring of national pride in South Korea on Monday, after the comedy-thriller directed by Bong Joon Ho became the first film not in English to win the award for best picture.\n\nThe victory made front-page news. \"The South Korean movie industry became 100 years old last year,\" said a 50-year-old office worker in Seoul, \"and this is a momentous event that makes South Koreans proud.\"\n\n\"Parasite\" also won awards for best director, original screenplay and international feature. Sharon Choi, an aspiring filmmaker, is the interpreter who has followed Mr. Bong and the \"Parasite\" team throughout their successful awards season.\n\nWatch: Mr. Bong narrated one of the scenes from \"Parasite\" last year for our \"Anatomy of a Scene\" series.\n\nOther Oscars: In the acting categories, Joaquin Phoenix won for \"Joker\"; Ren\u00e9e Zellweger for \"Judy\"; Brad Pitt for \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood\"; and Laura Dern for \"Marriage Story.\" Here's a complete list of winners.\n\nThe red carpet: View our collection of photographs from before and after the awards show.\n\nChinese officers charged in vast 2017 U.S. hack\n\nThe U.S. announced that it had charged four Chinese military officers with hacking Equifax, a major credit reporting agency, and making off with sensitive personal data on about 145 million Americans.\n\nThe Justice Department suggested that the hack was part of a string of major thefts organized by the People's Liberation Army and Chinese intelligence agencies, including the hacking of the U.S. government's personnel office in 2015.\n\nMotive: Law enforcement officials have not yet found evidence that the Chinese government has used the data from the Equifax hacking. But the U.S. suspects Beijing of developing databases on Americans for use in espionage.\n\nNew Hampshire primary set to shake up Democrats\n\nNew Hampshire is voting Tuesday in its Democratic presidential primary, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont leading recent polling averages and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., not far behind.\n\nThe two are trying to capitalize on their strong showings in the Iowa caucuses and zoom past rivals. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is reviving an earlier rallying cry: \"Nevertheless, she persisted.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to have a bad night, and the political outsider Andrew Yang faces a make-or-break moment.\n\nHere are our live updates as candidates dash around the state.\n\nGo deeper: The problems with the Iowa caucuses were bigger than one bad app. According to an investigation by our reporters, there was a total system failure.\n\nIf you have 6 minutes, this is worth itHow North Korea exploits the internet\n\n\"Our entire concept of how to control the North's financial engagement with the world is based on an image of the North that is fixed in the past.\"\n\nThat's a former National Security Agency analyst whose new study says that North Korea's internet use has surged about 300 percent since 2017 -- and that the bandwidth has allowed the country to move money around the world in defiance of international sanctions, to mine and steal cryptocurrencies and to unleash its hackers.\n\nOur national security correspondent David Sanger examines the study and the implications.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nThai gunman: Sgt. Jakrapanth Thomma, who killed 29 people in a devastating mass shooting over the weekend, held a grudge against his superior officer, a colonel, and the colonel's mother-in-law, according to those who knew him. His belief that the pair cheated him highlights a transactional side of the Thai military.\n\nGermany: Chancellor Angela Merkel's handpicked successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, bowed out of seeking the country's top position after opposing a decision by a branch of their party, the Christian Democratic Union, to make common cause in the country's east with the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nThe Philippines: The government moved to end the franchise of ABS-CBN Corp., the country's leading broadcast network. It's the latest push by President Rodrigo Duterte against media outlets that have been critical of his leadership.\n\nSnapshot: Above, a lightning storm over Pretoria, South Africa. Researchers say that Africa is experiencing bigger and more frequent thunderstorms as global temperatures rise.\n\nWhat we're reading: \"The 10,000-Year Clock Is a Waste of Time,\" in Wired. \"The piece takes a look at the complicated device being built in Texas -- mind-boggling not just because of its ambition, but as an emblem of the hubris of tech mega-billionaires.\"\n\nNow, a break from the news\n\nCook: Sesame noodles with chicken and peanuts is quick and spicy. (Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter has more recommendations.)\n\nRead: The writer Matthew Lopez discusses \"The Inheritance,\" his two-part play about gay culture in New York and the legacy of AIDS.\n\nListen: The indie rock duo Best Coast has a new song, \"Everything Has Changed,\" and a new outlook on life.\n\nSmarter Living: Better coffee at home is within reach. Here are five cheap(ish) things to make it happen.\n\nAnd now for the Back Story on ...The New Hampshire primary\n\nSome members of our politics team have been on the ground in New Hampshire for weeks. We talked to one of them, Matt Stevens, about the mood in the state ahead of Tuesday's primary.\n\nWe just came off a messy run in Iowa. Are there fears that New Hampshire's vote could also go awry?\n\nShort answer: Yes, absolutely. There are many, many things that could go wrong. But as some of our colleagues have pointed out, New Hampshire has a history of running elections smoothly, whereas the Iowa caucuses have now encountered problems in three consecutive cycles.\n\nHow are New Hampshire voters feeling about their primary system? Perhaps because of those divergent histories, the voters I have talked to here in New Hampshire have both expressed confidence in their system and given the side-eye to Iowa. Caucuses and primaries are very different, and the folks here are pretty darn sure their system is best.\n\nLast week, as the mess was unfolding in Iowa, a woman in Hampton, N.H., told me: \"This is a national level campaign. You have all these years to get it straight and this is the embarrassment you're causing the party?\"\n\nHow is your team managing back-to-back primaries?\n\nSome of us went to Iowa; most of the rest of us came to New Hampshire. And a handful did both. (Bless them!) The consensus among the people who have been to both places seems to be that the workroom at our hotel here in Manchester has windows, and is therefore far superior to the one in Des Moines, but the food options around our New Hampshire hotel are way more limited. I personally have already been to the Olive Garden next door twice.\n\nThat's it for this briefing.

briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)\n\nGood evening. Here's the latest.\n\n1. At least 20 Americans are among those who have been infected with the new coronavirus on a cruise ship quarantined in a Japanese port.\n\nMore than 2,500 passengers on board are being kept in effective isolation, eating meals in their cabins and keeping at least six feet from each other during the few minutes each day they are allowed on deck. And the situation is worse for crew members, who live elbow to elbow in cramped quarters.\n\nChina had extended its official Lunar New Year holiday by 10 days to help counter the virus's spread. But when the extension ended today, stores and factories remained empty, suggesting it could be weeks -- or months -- before one of the world's largest economies is humming again. Above, President Xi Jinping, who has remained conspicuously absent in recent weeks, made a rare public appearance to address the crisis.\n\nIn our Opinion section, an epidemiologist who is heading to the World Health Organization's emergency meeting on Tuesday lists what is known, and not yet known, about the virus.\n\n2. New Hampshire is next.\n\nThe state's Democratic presidential primary, the second contest in the 2020 race, is on Tuesday. Bernie Sanders, above, is leading in the polls, and Pete Buttigieg isn't far behind.\n\nThe two are trying to capitalize on their strong showings in the troubled Iowa caucuses, while increasingly training their fire on each other. Elizabeth Warren is reviving her rallying cry (\"Still, she persisted\"), the political outsider Andrew Yang faces a make-or-break moment, and Joe Biden is already looking beyond to his \"firewall\" in South Carolina.\n\nHere are our live updates as candidates dash around New Hampshire.\n\nIowa: The problems with the caucuses were bigger than one bad app. According to an investigation by our reporters, there was a total system failure.\n\n3. President Trump released a $4.8 trillion budget proposal, but it has little chance of being fully enacted by Congress.\n\nAs is usual, it's more of a messaging document. The message: Keep shrinking the federal safety net, with deep cuts to student loan assistance, affordable housing, food stamps and Medicaid, and slash the E.P.A. Add funds to the military, national defense and border enforcement.\n\nMr. Trump faces a secure spot in New Hampshire's Republican primary, with just one opponent: Bill Weld, the former Massachusetts governor.\n\nWe'll be in Manchester, N.H., for Mr. Trump's rally tonight.\n\n4. Four members of China's military were charged in the vast 2017 Equifax data breach, which exposed the personal information of about 145 million Americans.\n\nThe U.S. government said the attack was part of a series of big data thefts organized by the People's Liberation Army and Chinese intelligence agencies. Hackers stole names, birth dates and Social Security numbers of nearly half of all Americans -- data that could be combined with artificial intelligence to help identify and target U.S. intelligence officers.\n\nAnd in Israel, a \"grave\" security lapse in an election app promoted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led to the exposure of personal data of all 6.5 million eligible voters.\n\n5. Angela Merkel's chosen successor to lead Germany has stepped aside.\n\nAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, above, announced her resignation after a local chapter of her party, the center-right Christian Democrats, allied itself with a rising far-right party, Alternative for Germany.\n\nAt a time when neighboring countries are looking to Berlin for leadership in a post-Brexit Europe, Germany is struggling with an uncomfortable sense of having lived through this before, as the growing power of the far right echoes the rise of the Nazis.\n\n6. New rules at U.S. schools and colleges will shore up protections for victims of stalking and dating violence.\n\nThe rules will for the first time cement domestic violence, dating violence and stalking as forms of gender discrimination that schools must address. Victims' rights advocates say that while many schools have presumed such infractions fall under the broad umbrella of sexual harassment, not all have trained their staffs to address them.\n\nAbove, a memorial to Lauren McCluskey, a University of Utah track star who was kidnapped on campus and killed by a former boyfriend in 2018, and whose case helped inspire the changes.\n\n7. The Dart Container Corporation was an American success story. But it built its fortune on a modern environmental pariah: foam containers.\n\nAs states like New York, Maine and Maryland outlaw polystyrene foam, which can harm fish and other marine life, the company that helped spur a revolution in cups and clamshells is struggling to find a path forward.\n\nAnd in Africa, researchers found that an increase in temperatures over the past seven decades correlates with bigger and more frequent thunderstorms. That increase, combined with poor infrastructure, could mean more fatalities and more economic damage.\n\n8. California was about to lose its oldest weekly newspaper. And then in stepped Carl Butz.\n\nSince his retirement and his wife's death in 2017, Mr. Butz had considered traveling to England or Latvia, or riding the Trans-Siberian Railway. But one night, he said, he was watching \"Citizen Kane\" on cable and thought, I can do that.\n\nSo the 71-year-old cut a four-figure deal to buy The Mountain Messenger, earning himself a new career and saving Downieville, Calif., from becoming the latest small town to lose its newspaper.\n\n9. Lessons from the \"Parasite\" landslide.\n\nThe South Korean film's triumph as the first non-English language best picture winner is a result in part of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' efforts to diversify its voting base by race, gender, and nationality. It has added hundreds of new members from outside the U.S.\n\n\"The success of 'Parasite' makes me wonder if the best picture win for a middlebrow nothing like 'Green Book' last year was more anomalous than it seemed,\" said Manohla Dargis, in a conversation with fellow Times critics A.O. Scott and Wesley Morris.\n\nFrom the Oscars red carpet, our chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, writes that \"Janelle Mon\u00e1e, in silver crystal-covered, hooded Ralph Lauren, had the best dress. She looked like the ruler of an entire galaxy.\"\n\nBut the fashionista firepower wasn't enough for TV viewers: The audience fell 20 percent, to an all-time low of 23.6 million.\n\n10.

They have used tape to patch up battered protective masks, repeatedly reused goggles meant for one-time use, and wrapped their shoes in plastic bags for lack of specialized coverings.\n\nMs. Yu is now lying at home, feverish and fearful that she has been infected with the virus. She and other employees at the hospital said a lack of protective wear had left medical workers like her vulnerable in Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the heart of the epidemic that has engulfed this region.\n\n\"There are risks -- there simply aren't enough resources,\" Ms. Yu, an administrator at Wuhan Central Hospital, said in a brief telephone interview, adding that she was too weak to speak at length.\n\nRead the latest updates on the coronavirus crisis here.\n\nChinese medical workers at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus epidemic are often becoming its victims, partly because of government missteps and logistical hurdles.\n\nAfter the virus emerged in Wuhan late last year, city leaders played down its risks, so doctors didn't take precautions. When the outbreak could no longer be ignored, officials imposed a lockdown on Wuhan that expanded across the surrounding Hubei Province and then swaths of China. The vast travel cordons may have slowed the epidemic, but have also slowed deliveries into Hubei, leaving medical workers short of protective wear.\n\nBeijing\n\nBohai Sea\n\nYellow R.\n\nYellow\n\nSea\n\nCHINA\n\nXiaogan\n\nHUBEI\n\nShanghai\n\nWuhan\n\nYangtze R.\n\nJIANGXI\n\nTAIWAN\n\nHong Kong\n\nSouth\n\nChina Sea\n\n200 MILES\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nOn Friday, the Chinese government for the first time disclosed the toll the outbreak was taking on hospital employees: 1,716 medical workers had contracted the virus, including 1,502 in Wuhan, and six had died.\n\nThe strength -- or vulnerability -- of China's medical workers could shape how well the Communist Party weathers its worst political crisis in years. Li Wenliang, a doctor, died from the coronavirus last week, after he had been punished by the police for warning friends of the outbreak. His death ignited fury in China, where he was lionized as a medical martyr to officials who put political control ahead of health.\n\n\"Of course I'm nervous about getting infected,\" said Cai Yi, head of the division of pain management at Wuhan Central Hospital, the same hospital where Dr. Li had worked. \"But if we let ourselves be nervous, then what would happen to the people?\"\n\nChina's president and Communist Party leader, Xi Jinping, has praised hospital workers in Hubei as heroes, and mobilized the country in a \"people's war\" against the coronavirus. But hospital workers in Wuhan said they often felt frustrated and alone.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nSome have scrambled to buy protective gear with their own money, begged from friends, or relied on donations from other parts of China and abroad. Others have avoided eating and drinking for long stretches because going to the toilet meant discarding safety gowns that they would not be able to replace. Younger staff are assigned to the more critical cases, with the expectation that if they get sick they would be more likely to recover.\n\nEven as Chinese officials disclosed how many medical workers had been sickened and killed by the virus, key questions remain, experts said, including how the workers became infected and whether the rate of transmission was slowing. Such omissions could make it more difficult for other countries to assess and reduce their own risks.\n\n\"Clearly it would have been useful for other parts of China who are beginning to struggle with this outbreak as well for the rest of the world to have these types of data as soon as possible,\" said Malik Peiris, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nDr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said it is seeking more information about the time period and circumstances surrounding the infections of health care workers.\n\n\"This is a critical piece of information, because health workers are the glue that holds the health system and outbreak response together,\" Dr. Tedros said.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 71,300 people in China and 25 other countries.\n\nDoctors and other hospital workers have also come under pressure not to speak out. But many do, out of desperation.\n\n\"For the first time, I felt helpless confronting the system,\" Chang Le, a doctor at Hankou Hospital in Wuhan, said in an online message pleading for more medical masks. His plea was deleted by the censors. \"It's only today that I've grasped just how hard it is for us front line medical workers.\"\n\nThe Chinese government has acknowledged problems in medical supplies for Hubei, and repeatedly promised to accelerate deliveries.\n\nStrains in medical supplies may have been unavoidable as the virus spread at a pace that seemed to catch the government off guard. But the sweeping restrictions across China to contain the virus also slowed production and delivery of much-needed medical equipment, said doctors, factory managers, and aid workers.\n\nPervasive road checks and travel restrictions have held up shipments. Factories have faced difficulty increasing production because workers and raw materials have been blocked by lockdowns. Local governments have hoarded supplies. China's state-controlled Red Cross has dominated distribution of donations, creating a bottleneck that infuriated hospital employees.\n\nWith medical supplies so scarce, many health care workers in Wuhan also said they had to accept substandard gowns, gloves and masks. Outside the Wuhan Fourth Hospital, medical workers waited near a truck as a delivery man in a full-body medical suit handed down boxes of masks and gowns. One hospital worker explained that the gowns were not of a high enough grade to withstand a viral contagion.\n\n\"But this is all we could get,\" she said. She declined to give her name. \"We just have to accept what they send us.\"\n\nLife has become a scramble, many said: treating patients for much of the day; hunting for protective gear for the rest. The shortage has forced employees, like Dr. Chang, from the city's hospitals to appeal for donations of N95 masks -- a type of respirator best suited to guarding against viruses -- and other personal protective equipment on Chinese social media sites.\n\nDr. Peng Zhiyong, 53, head of the department of critical care medicine at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, said in an interview this week that his team was running dangerously low on full-body medical suits and masks. \"We can only get one break during the entire day,\" he said. \"Just one, to drink water and eat. Because if you leave, you don't have any new suits to get back into.\"\n\nThe first time the authorities publicly acknowledged a problem with medical worker infections was on Jan. 20, when an official expert revealed that 14 had been infected by a single patient. Until the government released details on Friday, details were scattershot, emerging in studies and news reports.\n\nDr. Peng and other researchers wrote that 40 health care professionals at his hospital had been infected in January, a third of the cases included in a study published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nA 61-year-old doctor died nine days after contracting the virus from a patient, according to a report by the newspaper China Philanthropy Times.\n\nAnother doctor had started to show symptoms early last month, before medical professionals knew to take extra precautions, according to the state-run Health Times newspaper. He died this past Monday.\n\nDuring the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS outbreak of 2002-2003, infections of medical workers became a source of anger after the government suppressed information for months. These workers made up 15 percent of confirmed cases, according to an expert, Xu Dezhong, quoted by Xinhua, China's official news agency. About 1 percent of the medical workers infected with SARS died.\n\nThe pleas from hospitals across Hubei have inspired an outpouring of donations from Chinese businesses, workers and charities. But the surge in demand for medical equipment has been hard for suppliers to meet, especially under the lockdown.\n\nOfficials in the city of Xiantao in Hubei at first told some companies making protective medical clothing and masks that their factories could not reopen until Feb. 14. An outcry followed, and the city's officials relented on Monday, saying that 73 of the companies could resume operations.\n\nThe roads to Hubei are also full of hurdles. In theory, the government has created \"green channels\" to speed through trucks carrying masks, gowns and equipment. In practice, local officials and police can hold up journeys.\n\nOne truck driver recounted being stopped 14 times for body temperature checks when he set out from Wuhan to pick up medical supplies, The Beijing News, a state-run Chinese newspaper, reported.\n\nGuo Fei, a 27-year-old entrepreneur who has been helping to buy and deliver supplies to hospitals in Xiaogan, a city in Hubei, said his team was held by the police for around eight hours in a neighboring province, Jiangxi, when they went there to pick up an order of hygienic gloves. The police seemed to be acting for local officials who wanted to retain the supplies for their area, he said.\n\n\"I can accept government controls,\" he said, \"but not local protectionism.\"\n\nDoctors also criticized bureaucracy for clogging up distribution. Many donations of medical supplies must be funneled through the Red Cross, and the organization -- understaffed and overwhelmed -- has struggled.\n\nIn a furious social media post, Dr. Chang, the doctor at the Hankou Hospital, described his experience trying to get 10,000 N95 respirator masks from the Red Cross. He was eventually given more than 9,000 masks of inferior quality, he said.\n\n\"I just wanted to cry,\" he said at the end of his video message.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang of China, who oversees a policy team for the crisis, said in early February that \"unified national management\" would help overcome equipment shortages.\n\nJust a week later, China's Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party's top most council, said problems with insufficient beds, medical personnel and other medical resources persisted across Hubei. According to official data from the province, deliveries of high-quality masks and other items have accelerated in recent days.\n\nThe country's health facilities are not only facing an acute shortage of personal protective equipment -- they may also be using the wrong gear.\n\nHealth workers in China generally have been following the W.H.O.'s guidelines to use so-called \"standard precautions\" which include surgical masks, rather than more expensive N95 masks, to cover their mouths and noses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on the other hand, has instructed health care providers to use N95s, which block out much smaller particles than surgical masks do.\n\nUntil conditions markedly improve, medical workers will still be forced to make hard adjustments. Dr. Cai, from Wuhan Central Hospital, said he has assigned younger medical workers to treat coronavirus patients to avoid endangering more seasoned employees. \"To be honest, if older doctors get infected, their immune system is much weaker,\" he said.\n\nDr. Peng of Zhongnan Hospital said more attention had to be paid to the fate of medical workers. \"Because when the country doesn't have any more medical workers, then what hope is there left?\"\n\nSui-Lee Wee reported from Singapore.

"body": "Friday: The news can be rough. Enjoy some tiny California love stories.\n\nGood morning.\n\n(If you don't already get California today delivered to your inbox, here's the sign-up.)\n\nA little while ago, we asked you to send us your tiny California love stories -- your meet-cutes, your reunions, your heartbreaks, all told in 100 words or fewer.\n\nWe got responses from readers young and older from around the state. And as it's Valentine's Day, we thought today would be the perfect day to share some of our favorites.\n\nFirst, here's a story about a bond between a reader and their aunt:\n\nI'm alone. She's stuck in LAX traffic. I get in her car, see her face for the first time -- an aunt I've never met, who I barely knew existed until my parents passed away. She calls her husband and uses my pronouns. I visit again. I move to Los Angeles. She makes me dinner. She loves me at Christmas. I love her at Thanksgiving. We grow together, and she loves me for me, and I love her for her dog. Together we get to build our family.\n\n-- AJ Stone Jonathan, 23, Los Angeles\n\nAnd a story of a reunion decades in the making:\n\nWhen my beloved husband of 41 years died of a heart attack in 2018, he took the life I had. He also opened the door for a new life -- and the gift to reconnect after 60 years with a childhood crush. First through tentative texts and cautious phone conversations (Where are you? Who are you?), then a first date hiking in Marin, to romantic weekends back to Carmel where we grew up among the cypress and pines, strolling along that incredible white-sand beach, our love blossomed. Now we have to buy a House Divided Stanford/Cal flag for Big Game!\n\n-- Julie Almquist, 69, Felton\n\nA quintessential Central Coast love story:\n\nI thought he was homeless when I met him, which wouldn't have been unusual in the coastal town where we lived. He'd show up disheveled at gatherings we frequented, sometimes smelling like he needed a shower. Our first date was Thai, our second at Bart's Books, an outdoor bookstore in beautiful Ojai. Turns out, he lived in an Airstream in the hills of Ventura County. A little over two years later, expecting our second, we eloped in Las Vegas. We live in 700 square feet now, and we can walk to the beach. He is my perfect California mountain man.\n\n-- Arlene Martinez, 43, Ventura (P.S. Arlene writes the In California newsletter for USA Today, which we recommend checking out if you, like us, can't get enough Golden State coverage.)\n\nAnd a story about making your home a new home, together:\n\nAfter we moved from Hong Kong, his home, to San Francisco, my home, Daniel drifts uneasily. The buildings aren't tall enough; the Muni isn't fast enough; the Chinese food isn't Chinese enough. \"There's better char siu here than in any other Western city,\" I object, as he blanches at my restaurant suggestions. Acceptance builds slowly: first at a hole-in-the-wall in Chinatown, followed by a space-warp into Kowloon at a Cantonese cafe in Sunset. \"This place is really authentic,\" he beams over satay beef macaroni soup and French toast. Even the rain outside feels like an authentic Pearl River Delta deluge.\n\n-- Michael Gold, 35, San Francisco\n\nA tale about meeting a stranger at the happiest place on earth:\n\nAndrew and I met at a Disneyland Annual Passholders' Meet-up, outside the Jungle Cruise. Neither of us were looking to date anyone, just to make friends. We were lined up by chance to sit side-by-side on Space Mountain that day. Our lives have been exciting ever since. We've weathered excellent days and health hardships over our many years together now, and we love each other more than ever. Although we don't have Disneyland Annual Passes anymore, Disneyland will always hold a special place in our hearts, because it brought two unlikely strangers together, first as friends, then into love.\n\n-- Claire Modie, 49, Manhattan Beach\n\nAnd finally, a love story, told from both sides, about reconnecting in an unexpected place:\n\nI met Jea as a freshman at Stanford. I thought she was cute, but lacked the moxie to ask her out. Then she started dating some other guy. A decade later, we were doctors-in-training at U.C. Davis. I was at the clinic when I randomly bumped into her. She was there as a patient, nervous that she might have thyroid cancer. We made awkward small talk before the nurse ushered her away. My moxie consisted of messaging her on Facebook. Fortunately, she returned my message. Even more fortunately, the thyroid ultrasound was negative. We've been married for four years.\n\n-- Charles Feng, 37, Sunnyvale\n\nIn a clinic at U.C. Davis in Sacramento, I thought I would be diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He was there signing paperwork for his patient. He immediately recognized me, saying, \"Remember me from Stanford?\" I couldn't recall what classes we might have taken together 10 years earlier. I don't remember my response -- perhaps just an icy stare? Turns out, I did not have cancer. Before I could write an email apologizing for my curtness, a message on Facebook asked me to dinner. Two years later, we were married at Stanford, and we're forever grateful to Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n-- Jea-Hyoun Kim, 37, Sunnyvale\n\nHere's what else to read\n\nWe often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Smartphones Interesting Again?", "body": "Amazing as it may sound, phone makers are doing more than just adding fancy new cameras.\n\nEach week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.\n\nHello, I'm Dai Wakabayashi, and I cover Google in San Francisco for The New York Times.\n\nFor the most part, writing about smartphones over the last few years has been pretty boring. Can you get that excited about a phone going from two cameras to three?\n\nBut this was an interesting week for smartphone news, illustrating both the promise of developments (pun alert) unfolding before us and the challenges of trying to do something new and different.\n\nA few days after Motorola (supposedly) started selling its foldable Razr phone, Samsung showed off its latest attempt at a bendable smartphone. The early reviews of Samsung's Galaxy Flip Z seem cautiously optimistic, with some reporters praising the glass screen and the sturdy-seeming hinges. I am more excited for these phones than my colleague Brian X. Chen, who made the levelheaded argument that these handsets were probably not ready for prime time and seemed like more trouble than they were worth.\n\nBut I don't think I am alone in experiencing a little device wanderlust. That was part of the bet behind Essential Products, once considered one of the most promising hardware start-ups in Silicon Valley.\n\nEssential Products was started by Andy Rubin, a former Google executive who had a successful track record in the smartphone industry. The company had raised $330 million. But Essential's first product, a premium smartphone, flopped. When The New York Times and others reported Mr. Rubin's departure from Google after an employee had accused him of sexual misconduct, it created even more challenges for the company.\n\nThis week, Essential said it was shutting down. The company said it saw \"no clear path\" to deliver its latest handset to customers. Essential was trying something different. It had developed a so-called companion phone named Project Gem, but carriers did not want to offer it, and the company decided to pull the plug.\n\nI asked a former Essential employee whether they thought this was a sign of how hard it is to compete in the smartphone industry. This person, who asked not to be identified because of a nondisclosure agreement with the company, called that analysis \"lazy\" and pinned more of the blame on dysfunction within the company.\n\nThe former employee said Essential had spent \"a bunch of time and money\" on a separate second smartphone called PH-2 (the first phone was called PH-1) to near completion only to scrap it when none of the carriers expressed an interest in it. This prompted an exodus of talented workers from the company.\n\nThe former employee said there were other red flags: There were more managers than engineers at Essential, and many quality assurance engineers, even though there was only one (poor-selling) product.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Rubin, who was supposed to be the driving force behind the products, seemed not fully engaged because he was busy dealing with his personal matters, the former employee said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Essential did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlso, and I'll stand my ground on this: It's really hard to break into the smartphone market.\n\nStories you shouldn't miss:\n\nThe changes in the world of smartphones came against the backdrop of alarming world news: Fears about the coronavirus outbreak forced the cancellation of the telecom industry's annual gathering, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\n\nThe United States is putting more pressure on the Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei. On Thursday, the Justice Department unveiled new charges against the company that invoked racketeering statutes usually used to bring down mob kingpins.\n\nI loved this column by Kevin Roose about Carlos Maza, who has become one of YouTube's biggest critics for failing to crack down on right-wing creators who have targeted him for harassment. But the column also captures beautifully how creators like Mr. Maza rely on YouTube as a way to make a living even as its policies leave them exposed.\n\nWelcome to elections in 2020. This wonderful article about how Michael R. Bloomberg is paying influencers to help him be meme-worthy and hip is a cringe-y delight.\n\nHindsight is 20/20. The Federal Trade Commission said this week that it had ordered Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft to provide information about hundreds of acquisitions over the last decade. These acquisitions did not require regulatory review because they were considered small. It does seem like regulators are now scrutinizing every nook and cranny of these companies.\n\nAmazon still wants the big, government cloud-computing contract -- and is willing to fight for it. A federal court ordered Microsoft to stop working on a $10 billion Pentagon cloud-computing contract until Amazon's legal challenge into how the deal was awarded is resolved.\n\nAmazon has protested the decision to award Microsoft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, claiming that President Trump had interfered with the bidding process because of his feud with Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive.\n\nHow are we doing?\n\nWe'd love your feedback on this newsletter.

Germany came to a halt in the last quarter of 2019 as consumers became more cautious about spending, leaving the economy vulnerable as it begins to feel the effects of the coronavirus outbreak in China.\n\nEconomic growth in Germany was zero from October through December, the Federal Statistics Office said on Friday, down from 0.2 percent growth in the previous quarter. The chances that Germany will bounce back during the current quarter are slim because of the coronavirus outbreak in China, which has hobbled one of Germany's most important customers and suppliers.\n\nStill, the economic performance was better than some economists had expected. A steep decline in orders for German industrial goods had led to predictions of a recession. Overall growth for 2019 was 0.6 percent, compared with 1.5 percent in 2018.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nUntil recently, spending by German consumers had helped compensate for a slump in manufacturing. But consumers became more cautious at the end of the year, perhaps unsettled by headlines about major job losses at German automakers.\n\nCompanies like Daimler, which reported a quarterly loss this week, have been cutting jobs because of slack demand and the cost of developing new technology they need to remain competitive.\n\nProblems in the car industry are not limited to Germany. Renault said on Friday that profit practically evaporated in 2019. The French carmaker acknowledged that it had been \"a troubled year.\"\n\nNet profit in 2019 plunged to 19 million euros, or about $21 million, from \u20ac3.5 billion in 2018, Renault said.\n\nRenault also warned that its goal of keeping sales steady at \u20ac56 billion during 2020 could be endangered by \"the possible impacts related to the coronavirus health crisis.\"", "source": {"uri":

Then They Vanished.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nHONG KONG -- The beige van squatted outside of a Wuhan hospital, its side and back doors ajar. Fang Bin, a local clothing salesman, peered inside as he walked past. He groaned: \"So many dead.\" He counted five, six, seven, eight body bags. \"This is too many.\"\n\nThat moment, in a 40-minute video about the coronavirus outbreak that has devastated China, propelled Mr. Fang to internet fame. Then, less than two weeks later, he disappeared.\n\nDays earlier, another prominent video blogger in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi, had also gone missing. Mr. Chen's friends and family said they believed he had been forcibly quarantined.\n\nBefore their disappearances, Mr. Fang and Mr. Chen had recorded dozens of videos from Wuhan, streaming unfiltered and often heartbreaking images from the center of the outbreak. Long lines outside hospitals. Feeble patients. Agonized relatives.\n\nThe footage would have been striking anywhere. But it was especially so coming from inside China, where even mild criticism of the authorities is quickly scrubbed from the online record, and those responsible for it often punished.\n\nThe appetite for the videos reflects, in part, the shortage of independent news sources in China, where professional newspapers are tightly controlled by the authorities. Earlier this month, the state propaganda department deployed hundreds of journalists to reshape the narrative of the outbreak.\n\nBut the videos also reflected the growing call for free speech in China in recent weeks, as the coronavirus crisis has prompted criticism and introspection from unexpected corners across the country.\n\nSeveral professional news organizations have produced incisive reports on the outbreak. A revolt against government censorship broke out on Chinese social media last week after the death of Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who had tried to warn of the virus before officials had acknowledged an outbreak.\n\nMr. Fang's and Mr. Chen's videos were another manifestation of the dissatisfaction that the government's handling of the outbreak has unleashed among ordinary Chinese citizens.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air.

This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\n\"When suddenly there's a crisis, they want to have access to a wider array of content and reporting,\" said Sarah Cook, who studies Chinese media at Freedom House, a pro-democracy research group based in the United States.\n\nThe disappearance of the two men also underscores that the ruling Communist Party has no intention of loosening its grip on free speech.\n\nChina's leader, Xi Jinping, said last month that officials needed to \"strengthen the guidance of public opinion.\" While Chinese social media has overflowed with fear and grief, state propaganda outlets have emphasized Mr. Xi's steady hand, framed the fight against the outbreak as a form of patriotism and shared upbeat videos of medical workers dancing.\n\nMore than 350 people across China have been punished for \"spreading rumors\" about the outbreak, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group.\n\nMr. Chen, a fast-talking, fresh-faced lawyer from eastern China, was already well-known online before the outbreak. He traveled to Hong Kong during the pro-democracy protests last year and disputed the Chinese authorities' depiction of the demonstrators as a riotous mob.\n\nThe Beijing authorities summoned him back to the mainland and deleted his social media accounts, Mr. Chen told his followers later.\n\nBut when the coronavirus led officials to seal off Wuhan last month, he raced to the city of 11 million, citing his duty as a self-declared citizen journalist. \"What sort of a journalist are you if you don't dare rush to the front line?\" he said.\n\nIn his videos, which drew millions of views on YouTube, Mr. Chen interviewed locals who had lost loved ones, filmed a woman breaking down as she waited for care and visited an exhibition center that had been converted into a quarantine center.\n\nHe was blocked from WeChat, a major Chinese social media app, for spreading rumors. But he was adamant that he shared only what he himself had seen or heard.\n\nAs time went on, Mr. Chen, usually energetic, began to show strain. \"I am scared,\" he said on Jan. 30. \"In front of me is the virus. Behind me is China's legal and administrative power.\"\n\nThe authorities had contacted his parents to ask for his whereabouts, he said. He teared up suddenly. Then, his finger pointing at the camera, he blurted: \"I'm not even scared of death. You think I'm scared of you, Communist Party?\"\n\nOn Feb. 6, Mr. Chen's friends lost contact with him. Xu Xiaodong, a prominent mixed martial arts practitioner and a friend of Mr. Chen, posted a video on Feb. 7 saying that Mr. Chen's parents had been told that their son had been quarantined, though he had not shown symptoms of illness.\n\nUnlike Mr. Chen, Mr. Fang, the clothing salesman, was fairly anonymous before the coronavirus outbreak. Much of his YouTube activity had involved producing enthusiastic videos about traditional Chinese clothing.\n\nBut as the outbreak escalated, he began sharing videos of Wuhan's empty streets and crowded hospitals. They lacked the slickness of Mr. Chen's dispatches, which were often subtitled and tightly edited. But, as with Mr. Chen's videos, they showed a man growing increasingly desperate -- and defiant.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Mr. Fang described how officials had confiscated his laptop and interrogated him about his footage of the body bags. On Feb. 4, he filmed a group of people outside his home, who said they were there to ask him questions. He turned them away, daring them to break down his door.\n\nIn his final videos, Mr. Fang turned explicitly political in a way rarely heard inside China, at least in public. Filming from inside his home -- he said he was surrounded by plainclothes policemen -- he railed against \"greed for power\" and \"tyranny.\"\n\nHis last video, on Feb. 9, was just 12 seconds long. It featured a scroll of paper with the words, \"All citizens resist, hand power back to the people.\"\n\nDespite the worldwide audience for Mr. Fang's and Mr. Chen's videos, it is hard to know how much reach they had domestically, said Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor of journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Both men relied heavily on YouTube and Twitter, which are blocked in China.\n\nBut unlike the torrent of grief and anger online in response to the death of Dr. Li, news of Mr. Chen's and Mr. Fang's disappearances has been swiftly stamped out on Chinese social media. Their names returned almost no results on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, on Friday.\n\nStill, Ms. Cook said the power of Mr. Chen's and Mr. Fang's videos, as well as the reporting done by professional journalists in Wuhan, should not be underestimated.\n\nShe pointed to the Chinese authorities' decision this week to loosen diagnostic requirements for coronavirus cases, leading to a significant jump in reported infections, as evidence of their impact.\n\nThat decision might not have come \"if you didn't have all these people in Wuhan sending out reports that what you're hearing is an underestimate,\" Ms. Cook said. \"These very courageous individuals can, in unusual circumstances, push back and force the state's hand.\"\n\nMr. Fang, in one of his last videos, seemed struck by a similar sentiment. He thanked his viewers, who he said had been calling him nonstop to send support.\n\n\"A person, just an ordinary person, a silly person,\" he said of himself, \"who lifted the lid for a second.\"\n\nElaine Yu contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vivian_wang@nytimes.com", "name": "Vivian

China Are Showing Signs of Reconciliation", "body": "The day after Kobe Bryant died, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, posted a statement on Twitter: \"Saddened by the tragic loss of #KobeBryant. An inspiration for many and a legend of his generation, he will always be remembered for his contribution to the world of sport and to #ChinaUS people-to-people exchanges.\"\n\nThough Bryant was a huge star in the country -- even the most popular sports figure, for awhile -- the ambassador's message was notable. China and the N.B.A. have been on the outs since October, when Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, shared an image on Twitter that showed support for the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. This roiled the Chinese government and instantly derailed decades of league efforts to court the country's sizable basketball audience, initiating a conflict at the rare intersection of sports, domestic politics, corporate profits and international relations\n\nFour months later, China is grappling with the coronavirus that has sickened thousands of its people and disrupted the economy, and as the N.B.A. embarks on its signature All-Star weekend, in Chicago, there are signs that tension between the two sides has begun to dissipate, even beyond the tweet from Cui.\n\n\"Right now, our focus is on working with global health organizations to provide whatever assistance we can to the people of China in response to the coronavirus outbreak,\" N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver told The New York Times on Thursday in an emailed statement. \"Many of our Chinese partners were unable to attend our N.B.A. All-Star events because of travel restrictions, but all of the weekend's events will be carried in China on Tencent.\"\n\nThis, too, is notable. Tencent, the Chinese streaming network, after initially stopping its coverage, has been showing up to three games a night. China's state-run television network, China Central Television, canceled its broadcasts of the preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Nets and several other related league events in the aftermath of Morey's tweet. Silver, at a live event soon after, said the Chinese government had demanded that Morey be fired -- but he immediately said no. The N.B.A. has not been back on CCTV since.\n\nThere are those around the league who believe there is a chance that CCTV airs the N.B.A. All-Star Game -- and more games after that. Joe Tsai, the co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba and owner of the Nets, recently told Bloomberg, \"Once you're on the air, everything will come back.\" (Tsai declined to comment.)\n\nAt the time of the initial controversy, Yao Ming, the former Rockets great and chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, was described as \"extremely hot\" by Silver over the situation. But he traveled to the United States last month to attend a memorial service for David Stern, the former commissioner of the N.B.A. Silver and Yao spoke at the memorial, according to a source familiar with the discussion who was not authorized to disclose it publicly. Last week, Huang Ping, the Chinese consulate general, thanked the league at a media briefing in New York for donating $1.4 million to the Hubei Province, the center of the coronavirus, to help fight its spread. Several N.B.A. teams marked the Chinese New Year with promotions at their arenas, as they have in other years.\n\nWhile the protests in Hong Kong remain a hot button topic in China, as the reaction to Morey showed, Kristen Looney, an assistant professor of Asian studies and government at Georgetown University, said China could choose to move on as if nothing happened.\n\n\"They do that occasionally. It's big business for them too, having the N.B.A. in China,\" Looney said. \"Hundreds of millions of people watch basketball in China -- and I know they're unhappy with lack of access. But I doubt anything happens during this N.B.A. season, unless the government decides that bringing the game back would be a welcome distraction from the public health crisis.\"\n\nThe stakes are high for the league. Since 2004, the N.B.A. has played 28 games in China. Star players travel every year for promotional tours. Shoe sales are a major source of revenue for manufacturers. There are more basketball fans in China, a country with 1.4 billion residents, than in the U.S., which has a population of 330 million. The league still has offices throughout China, including in Shanghai, Beijing, Taiwan and Hong Kong, staffed by about 200 employees.\n\n\"I see it as something that's going to take time,\" said Todd Ramasar, an N.B.A. agent with overseas clients who has also negotiated deals in China. \"I don't think it's something as simple as saying this is centered around the N.B.A. This is much bigger than that.\"\n\nThe timing of the All-Star game, on Sunday, may be a stroke of good luck for the N.B.A. because of the larger domestic politics involved. On Friday, the first phase of the trade deal struck last month between China and the U.S. will take effect, signaling the warmest point in the relationship between the two countries since President Trump took office.\n\nEarlier this month, at his State of the Union speech, Trump said, \"We have perhaps the best relationship we've ever had with China, including with President Xi,\" referring to China's leader, Xi Jinping. On Feb. 7, Trump praised Xi for the Chinese government's response to the coronavirus.\n\nBut there is also mixed messaging -- an indication of the often fraught relationship between the two countries. At the end of January, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the ruling party in China the \"the central threat of our times.\"\n\nIt is unclear what the business impact of the China fallout has been for the N.B.A. One indicator is the league's salary cap, the amount that each team can spend on player contracts each season. It is determined by the amount of basketball related income the N.B.A. takes in. Next season, it is projected to be $116 million, an increase from $109.1 million this season, according to ESPN -- an indication that the league is in a healthy place. However, projections can change. And China is one of several external revenue streams.\n\nThere are also critics in America who believe that the league should limit its dealings with an authoritarian government.\n\nAt home, the N.B.A. faced blowback from politicians all over the spectrum following Morey's Twitter post, which read \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\" The critics, including many Democratic presidential candidates and their ideological foes, like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, accused the N.B.A. of capitulating to a repressive regime to increase its bottom line. The league said at the time that the anger from the Chinese mainland was \"regrettable\" and Morey had \"deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China.\" The Chinese version of the statement read differently and said that the league was \"extremely disappointed in the inappropriate comment\" by Morey. Morey has not spoken about the issue publicly since a follow-up statement in which he said he did not mean to \"cause any offense.\" He declined to comment for this article.\n\nIn the months since, the United States has had to confront the fact that many businesses have interests in China. Bob Iger, the chief executive officer of Disney, said at a conference in October that he would not criticize China's handling of the Hong Kong protesters because \"to take a position that could harm our company in some form would be a big mistake. I just don't believe it's something we should engage in a public manner.\" The comments went unmentioned by many of the same politicians who blasted the N.B.A.\n\nSilver has also made clear that he would like the league to make amends with China, regardless of the optics of doing business with an oppressive regime. Mike Bass, an N.B.A. spokesman, said the league has \"no plans to stop distributing our games in China.\"\n\n\"We continue to believe in the unique power of sports to bring people together across cultures,\" Bass said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sopan_deb@nytimes.com", "name": "Sopan Deb", "type": "author",

Coronavirus Story is Too Big for China to Spin", "body": "Maybe what goes up online must come down, but what comes down will go up again.\n\nReactions to Li Wenliang's death last Friday filled the timelines of my social media accounts almost immediately. Post after post on my WeChat. Grief, frustration, anger.\n\nA week later, the groundswell of emotions seems unabated.\n\nDr. Li, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, was one of the first doctors to try to warn about the disease, and then to die from it.\n\nThe story of how the authorities muzzled Dr. Li became an instant parable for their trampling on the Chinese public's right to know. The authorities' effort to now muzzle the public's outrage is a parable of government unaccountability.\n\nOn Dec. 30, Dr. Li told former classmates from medical school in a WeChat group that several patients displaying SARS-like symptoms were being quarantined. He was quickly summoned for questioning by the police.\n\nOn Jan. 3, Dr. Li was made to sign a statement declaring that his warning had been incorrect and was \"illegal,\" and that it had \"disturbed social order.\" Under a typed admonishment that said, \"If you continue this illegal activity, you will be dealt with by the law! Do you understand?\" he wrote by hand, \"I understand.\" Would he now cooperate with the police? \"I can.\"\n\nIn an interview later with Caixin, one of China's leading investigative news outlets, Dr. Li said, \"There shouldn't be only one voice in a healthy society.\" After news broke last week that he had died, a picture with his quote ignited the Chinese internet.\n\nFang Fang, a fiction writer based in Wuhan, has been documenting daily life in the city. \"Dear internet censors, you should let Wuhan people speak,\" she wrote recently. \"We've been locked down here for more than ten days; we've seen too many extreme tragedies. If you don't allow us to express our anguish or complaints or reflections, do you really want us to go mad?\"\n\nAllowed or not, the people are expressing their anguish, complaints and reflections.\n\nA post on WeChat with photos of young people wearing surgical masks inscribed with \"I cannot\" and \"I do not understand\" quickly spread online. So did a letter signed by 10 professors in Wuhan demanding an apology from the officials who silenced Dr. Li and other whistle-blower doctors. Both posts were promptly taken down.\n\nOn Feb. 11, a group of middle-school teachers in Chengdu, about 700 miles west of Wuhan, posted online an open letter to their students about the outbreak. \"In 'The Plague,' Albert Camus wrote that the only way to fight with the plague is honesty,\" the text went. \"We cannot turn a funeral into a wedding. We cannot use songs of praise to replace questioning.\"\n\nThe article, which was hugely popular online, was taken down just hours after it was posted.\n\nA news website run by the city authorities of Dongying, in the eastern province of Shandong, published an article late last month praising the online censor Guo Qiqi: She sleeps just four hours a day, and monitors the internet for 20. The article included photos of a policewoman whose job was to monitor Twitter and Facebook, which are blocked inside China.\n\nThe piece swept Weibo like a storm -- but not as the authorities had intended. \"Trying hard to build a Brave New World,\" said one comment.\n\nThe article and the comments have since been deleted.\n\nThe censors can't keep up, though: Maybe what goes up online must come down, but what comes down will go up again.\n\nWhich might explain why, in addition to trying to prevent people from openly discussing Dr. Li's death, the information blackout in the early stages of the outbreak and the government's handling of the crisis overall, the authorities are also trying to peddle an alternative narrative -- and one that co-opts Dr. Li's story.\n\nAs ever, the central government in Beijing is scrambling to project the image that it has everything under control. Instead of admitting to any large-scale inefficiencies or errors, it has sent a team to Wuhan to investigate Dr. Li's death. Two senior provincial party officials were sacked on Thursday.\n\nThe government is also trying to cast Dr. Li's death as the nation's sacrifice -- meaning, the Chinese Communist Party's own.\n\nThe veteran epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, who is credited with identifying the coronavirus that causes SARS and is widely revered, wept as he spoke about Dr. Li in an interview with Reuters this week. \"The majority of people think he's a hero of China,\" Dr. Zhong said, in English, tears welling. \"I'm so proud of him. He told people the truth at the end of December.\" Many people share that view.\n\nOnly, they don't want the Chinese Communist Party telling them who is a hero or what heroism is.\n\nXinhua, the party's official news agency, has called for the population to \"turn grief into strength\" -- and follow Dr. Li's example to \"complete his unfinished undertaking.\"\n\nThat's a dangerous invitation. The people can see through the government's ploy, and they are fuming.\n\nOn Sunday, I read an article online about Yan Cheng, a teenager with severe cerebral palsy who died on Jan. 29, a week after his father was taken into quarantine. The teenager was unable to look after himself and yet he was left on his own. I pored over a photo of him smiling, taken not long before he died.

Briefing", "body": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)\n\nGood morning.\n\nWe're covering Attorney General William Barr's challenge to President Trump, the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak, and good news in the fight against Australia's wildfires.\n\n'Stop the tweeting,' attorney general says\n\nAttorney General William Barr said in an interview on Thursday that President Trump's attacks on the Justice Department had made it \"impossible for me to do my job,\" adding, \"I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody.\"\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly criticized officials in the department and denounced a sentencing recommendation for his associate Roger Stone. Here's a transcript of excerpts from Mr. Barr's interview with ABC News.\n\nMr. Trump did not immediately respond on Twitter, but his press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said, \"The president wasn't bothered by the comments at all.\" The attorney general had let the president know some of what he planned to say and is remaining in his job, a person familiar with the events told The Times.\n\nAnother angle: Critics of Mr. Barr dismissed his comments as mainly a way to deflect responsibility for carrying out Mr. Trump's political wishes. \"The tell here will be Trump's reaction,\" said Joe Lockhart, a White House press secretary under former President Bill Clinton. \"If he doesn't lash out, we'll all know this was pure political theater.\"\n\nMore than 1,700 medical workers infected in China\n\nThe Chinese authorities disclosed for the first time today that 1,716 medical workers had contracted the coronavirus and that six had died. The number of infected workers represents 3.8 percent of China's overall confirmed infections. Here are the latest updates and maps of where the virus has spread.\n\nThe news comes a day after China widened a mass roundup of potential patients, as the government conducts what it has called a \"wartime\" campaign to stamp out the epidemic.\n\nRelated: The U.S. said it would approve humanitarian assistance to North Korea to help fight the coronavirus. There are fears the country may be hiding an outbreak.\n\nGo deeper: Psychologists say that differing responses to the virus and the flu illustrate our shortcomings in evaluating danger. Our Interpreter columnist Max Fisher explains.\n\nA look at Pete Buttigieg's time as mayor\n\nThe experience that he gained as the leader of South Bend, Ind., is a central part of Mr. Buttigieg's pitch to be president, while his rivals try to sow doubts about whether he is prepared for the Oval Office.\n\nHis record in trying to turn the Midwestern city around has also been challenged by some residents and activists, particularly on problems facing black residents.\n\nOur correspondent traveled to South Bend to learn more about how Mr. Buttigieg, 38, governed and grew over his eight years in office.\n\nYesterday: Elizabeth Warren criticized Michael Bloomberg after video emerged of a lecture he gave 12 years ago in which he linked the 2008 financial crisis to the end of a discriminatory housing practice.\n\nDueling misjudgments by the U.S. and Iran\n\nA nine-month period that shook up the already tense relationship between the two countries began with the Trump administration's escalation of sanctions and ended with Washington and Tehran in a direct military confrontation.\n\nA team of our reporters has traced the path to last month's violent standoff, finding a story of miscalculations by both sides.\n\nYesterday: The Senate voted to require that President Trump seek congressional authorization before taking further military action against Iran, a mostly symbolic measure that lacked the support needed to override a promised veto.\n\nIf you have 20 minutes, this is worth itA glimpse of the coastal future\n\nAn estimated 600 million people worldwide live on coastlines -- hazardous places in an era of climate change. The Times examined how two metropolitan areas, Manila, above left, and San Francisco, are handling rising sea levels.\n\nWill they try to hold back the waters or move people away? Their decisions could offer crucial lessons for coastal cities around the world.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nBillions diverted for wall: The Pentagon said it would devote $3.8 billion that Congress had designated for other purposes to building a wall at the southwestern border.\n\nHarvey Weinstein's defense: A lawyer for the former Hollywood producer told jurors at his rape trial that he was the victim of an \"overzealous prosecution\" and that his accusers had engaged in consensual relationships with him.\n\nAustralian fires controlled: The wildfires that began in September and consumed millions of acres are finally out in most of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, emergency services said today.\n\nThe Weekly: The latest episode of The Times's TV show is about the police crackdown on protesters at a university in Hong Kong last year. It premieres today on FX at 10 p.m. Eastern and will be available on Hulu starting Saturday.\n\nSnapshot: Above, the German city of Dresden in 1945, the year it was bombed by the Allies. On Thursday, Germans commemorated the 75th anniversary of the devastating attack, which a resurgent far right has used to promote a revisionist history of World War II.\n\nNews quiz: Did you follow the headlines this week? Test yourself.\n\nModern Love: In this week's column, how a woman's worst date became her best one.\n\nLate-night comedy: The hosts watched as President Trump and Michael Bloomberg traded insults. \"This is crazy,\" Trevor Noah said. \"Two mega-rich dudes dissing each other in the most personal way. It would be like if a rap battle was on CNBC.\"\n\nWhat we're listening to: This episode of \"The New Yorker Radio Hour.\" Sam Sifton, our food editor, writes: \"I enjoyed listening to Hilton Als talk about Louis C.K.'s return to the stage, and about how it might have gone differently, had Louis attempted art and not commerce.\"\n\nNow, a break from the news\n\nCook: Take time this weekend for stuffed shells.\n\nSee: Two paintings of Napoleon, one wearing Timberlands, are on display at the Brooklyn Museum. It's a face-off between two visions of the political power of art, our critic Jason Farago writes.\n\nRead: In honor of Valentine's Day, we've listed works of fiction from each of the 50 states that explore matters of the heart.\n\nSmarter Living: There are good ways and bad ways for colleagues with different circadian rhythms to work together. Here are some tips.\n\nAnd now for the Back Story on ...Reporting on the coronavirus\n\nDonald McNeil, a science reporter for The Times, is part of a team covering the spread of the virus. This is a condensed version of a conversation about his observations and concerns.\n\nWhat do we know, and what don't we know, about the coronavirus?\n\nIn the beginning of every epidemic, there is the fog of war.\n\nI'd say we're still in that fog. We know this virus is much more transmissible than SARS or MERS. We don't know if it's quite as transmissible as the flu. We know it can kill people. We know it's not nearly as lethal as MERS or SARS.\n\nOne of the things we don't know is what the Chinese aren't saying. We know that they're reluctant to let in outside experts and wouldn't share samples of the earliest cases with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhen you ask scientists, \"What's your fear for the Big One, the pandemic that's going to kill us all?\" -- not that there is a pandemic that's going to kill us all -- but if you ask them that, they say, \"Flu.\" They worry about some new flu, bird flu or swine flu, that's highly lethal but becomes very transmissible between humans. I know only one or two scientists who have said, \"You know, I also worry about coronaviruses being the Big One.\"\n\nI don't want to raise alarm that this is the Big One. But this is a new, scary and confusing one, and we don't yet know how far it's going to spread and how many people it's going to kill.\n\nWhat do you think about the public's reaction to your reporting?\n\nI'm always trying to figure out: Am I being alarmist, or am I not being alarmist enough? I was too alarmist about H5N1 back in 2005, the bird flu. I was not alarmist enough about West Africa and Ebola in its early days. All previous Ebola outbreaks had killed a few hundred people. That one killed 11,000.\n\nA big part of my beat is debunking the panicky stories. It actually consumes almost as much of my time as reporting does.\n\nI try to spread truth instead of panic, even if it takes me a little longer to get it right.\n\nThat's it for this briefing. See you next time.\n\n-- Chris\n\nThank you\n\nMark Josephson and Kathleen Massara provided the break from the news. Alex Traub wrote today's Back Story.

"'Thermometer Guns' on Coronavirus Front Lines Are 'Notoriously Not Accurate'", "body": "It has become an iconic image of the coronavirus outbreak in China: a masked official aiming what appears to be a small white pistol at a traveler's forehead.\n\nFor weeks, this ominous-looking device has been deployed at checkpoints across China -- tollbooths, apartment complexes, hotels, grocery stores, train stations -- as government officials and private citizens screen people for fevers in an effort to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.\n\nSometimes described as a \"thermometer gun,\" the device is equipped with an infrared sensor that can quickly measure surface temperature without making any contact with a person's skin. In recent years, it has become an important tool for countries scrambling to contain viral outbreaks. It was widely used to try to slow the spread of SARS in China in the early 2000s and to curb the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a decade later.\n\nBut for all of its powerful sensing technology, the thermometer has ultimately proved to be an ineffective defense mechanism, according to medical officials and experts on infrared devices. Like the surgical masks that have become ubiquitous in China, thermometer guns tend to be unreliable outside carefully controlled health care settings.\n\nThe thermometers determine temperature by measuring the heat emanating from the surface of a person's body. Often, however, those wielding the tools don't hold them close enough to the subject's forehead, generating unusually low temperature readings, or hold them too close and get a high reading. The measurements can be imprecise in certain environments, like a dusty roadside, or when someone has taken medication to suppress a fever.\n\n\"These devices are notoriously not accurate and reliable,\" said James Lawler, a medical expert at the University of Nebraska's Global Center for Health Security. \"Some of it is quite frankly for show.\"\n\nWhen he traveled in West Africa during the Ebola outbreak, Mr. Lawler was frequently tested with infrared thermometers. The results suggested he was dying of hypothermia.\n\n\"My temperature was often 35 degrees Celsius or lower, which starts to become incompatible with life,\" Mr. Lawler said. \"So I'm not sure those were accurate.\"\n\nIn theory, the thermometers, as well as more complex cameras that can also measure the heat coming off a person, allow local officials to quickly determine who may have a fever and then pull those people aside for further testing. So far, tens of thousands of people have contracted the coronavirus, and earlier this week deaths passed the 1,000 mark. Last month, the World Health Organization said that temperature screenings could reduce \"the risk of importation.\"\n\nBut on social media in China, people passing through the checkpoints have complained that the thermometers are producing unrealistically low temperature readings in some situations and artificially high readings in others, like when a traveler is tested from inside a hot car.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\n\"You know the temperature gun is inaccurate,\" wrote one person on Weibo, the Chinese social media service, after getting a reading from a guard. \"I know the temperature gun is inaccurate. He also knows the temperature gun is inaccurate. But nobody says anything because it's part of the process. Such formalism!\"\n\nJust because an infrared tool says that someone has a high temperature does not mean the person is actually sick, let alone carrying the virus.\n\n\"They could have been exercising, they could be taking certain drugs,\" said Jim Seffrin, an expert on infrared devices at the Infraspection Institute in New Jersey. \"A person who's been trying to catch a flight in an airport for which they are late -- they may have run down a concourse.\"\n\nThe growing demand for thermometer guns and infrared cameras that can detect fevers has caused shortages across the world, from the center of the outbreak in Wuhan to a small supplier in Texas.\n\nA host of Chinese companies make thermometer guns, which have become more expensive as demand has increased.\n\nAlicn Medical (Shenzhen), a manufacturing in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, makes 2.5 million thermometer guns a year and is one of only a handful in China that can achieve that level of production, said Mo Yingchun, its general manager. Still, raw material costs have surged and many workers can't get around China's outbreak containment efforts to show up for their jobs, meaning the company isn't producing at full capacity.\n\n\"Even the governments are fighting for the products among themselves,\" Mr. Mo said, noting that priced had climbed to three to five time their usual level. \"Local governments want to guarantee their own needs first.\"\n\nHe said the thermometer are typically used indoors for checking on babies. \"The thermometer guns are used only for quick screening and are not as accurate as traditional thermometers,\" Mr. Mo said. \"It was a small industry and, if it weren't for the outbreak, it will not be put in the spotlight.\"\n\nThousands of miles from the heart of the outbreak, a small technology supplier in Beaumont, Tex., called Infrared Cameras Inc., has also been feeling the crush of demand. The company makes high-tech imaging equipment as well as infrared thermometers, which cost $25 apiece.\n\nIn a normal month, the company sells about 100 infrared cameras, according to its chief executive, Gary Strahan. Since January, the company has sold more than 1,000, supplying schools, cruise ships, factories, offices, hospitals and theaters in countries like China and South Korea.\n\nMr. Strahan said he had been working every day from 4 a.m. to 10 p.m. to keep up with the orders.\n\n\"It's the most overwhelming thing I've had to deal with in my life,\" he said. \"We've got people coming to us directly saying, 'Can you supply 1,000 cameras? Can you supply 2,000 cameras?'\"\n\nThe company's cameras and thermometer guns have a margin of error of 0.1 to 0.2 degrees Celsius, according to Mr. Strahan, who has been selling infrared cameras since the 1990s. But many products on the market are less reliable.\n\nDuring past outbreaks, some checkpoints have used cameras or thermometer guns that were designed for industrial purposes, like measuring the temperature of a vehicle, rather than finely calibrated medical tools.\n\n\"If you're going to use the technology, you have to come at it with the proper equipment,\" said Mr. Seffrin of the Infraspection Institute. \"What we saw during the SARS outbreak is people were quick to pick up industrial instruments.\"\n\nEven a perfectly precise temperature sensor would not necessarily catch everyone carrying the coronavirus. Infected people can take several days to develop a fever, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. And travelers who already have a fever might take Tylenol to suppress their symptoms, sometimes in a deliberate effort to deceive the authorities. In Qinghai Province in China, police are investigating one man on suspicion that he passed through checkpoints by covering up his ailments.\n\nStill, Mr. Strahan said he hoped his company would help slow the spread of the virus, even if temperature screenings are unlikely to stop the outbreak altogether.\n\n\"Because of the inaccuracy of a lot of the systems being sold out there, people are missed and then the infection spreads,\" he said. \"It's a very real situation, and I feel like I'm right in the middle of it.\"\n\nThat was certainly the case on Thursday morning: At the company's office in Beaumont, Mr. Strahan's team was packing 300 thermometer guns into boxes, all of them bound for China.\n\nYiwei Wang contributed research.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType":

Outbreak\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- The United States said it would approve humanitarian assistance to North Korea to help international aid agencies fight the coronavirus there, amid fears that the impoverished country may be hiding an outbreak.\n\nNorth Korea has not reported any cases of the new coronavirus. But in the past week, some South Korean news reports, citing unnamed sources within the secretive North, said there had been deaths that were suspected to be related to the virus. The reports could not be confirmed.\n\nNorth Korea shares a 930-mile border with China, where the coronavirus emerged. It has since spread to numerous countries; more than 1,300 deaths have been reported, almost all of them in China.\n\nNorth Korea has taken aggressive steps to keep the virus out, including suspending all flights and trains to and from China. But the border has long been porous for smugglers, who ferry goods across the shallow river frontier that separates the two countries.\n\nNorth Korea's public health system is dysfunctional, and the travel restrictions have made it harder for the North to buy or smuggle medicine, goods or other supplies from China. Relief organizations have complained that American-led international sanctions against the North, imposed because of its nuclear weapons program, have prevented them from providing aid quickly.\n\nThis week, the Red Cross called for a sanctions exemption that would let it transfer money to its office in North Korea, describing it as \"a lifesaving intervention.\" It cited an urgent need for personal protective gear and testing kits to prepare for a possible outbreak in the North.\n\nThe United States has also expressed alarm, and it said on Thursday that it would not stand in the way of such aid.\n\n\"The United States is deeply concerned about the vulnerability of the North Korean people to a coronavirus outbreak,\" Morgan Ortagus, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement. She added that Washington encouraged American and international aid groups to \"counter and contain the spread of coronavirus\" in the North.\n\n\"The United States is ready and prepared to expeditiously facilitate the approval of assistance from these organizations,\" she said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air.

How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nSo far, North Korea has said nothing about how many people it may have quarantined or tested for the virus. But it is clearly taking the threat seriously, having suspended international tourism and, more recently, extended the quarantine period for people with coronavirus symptoms, from 14 days to 30 days.\n\nIts state media has carried photos of mask-wearing officials holding emergency meetings at disease-control centers and disinfecting ports and train stations. The North also asked South Korean officials to vacate a joint liaison office in the North Korean city of Kaesong as a precaution against the virus.\n\nEarlier this month, state media said health officials had stepped up inspections on \"all routes leading to the capital city,\" Pyongyang, which is home to North Korea's elite, including the top leader, Kim Jong-un. It said the authorities were requiring all people passing through Pyongyang's main train station to wear masks.\n\nAmid the many signs that North Korea fears an outbreak, its state media has reported no public appearances by Mr. Kim since he watched a concert in Pyongyang a few weeks ago.\n\nLiberty Post Korea, a Seoul-based website run by a North Korean defector, reported last week that 4,000 North Koreans had been placed under special monitoring for symptoms in one northern province bordering China, and that 720 had been quarantined in hospitals. The report quoted an unidentified source in the North and could not be independently verified.\n\nDaily NK, another Seoul-based website that relies on anonymous sources inside the North, reported last week that five people had died in hospitals in another northern province after suffering from fevers, and that people there had speculated that they died from the coronavirus.\n\nAs North Korea shut its ports and borders to foreign goods and summoned back officials who had been earning hard currency in China, quarantining them on the border, both commodity prices and exchange rates have begun rising in some northern towns, Daily NK said. North Korea's military has also been smuggling in large quantities of South Korean face masks through China, it said.\n\nKim Seung-eun, a Christian pastor and human rights activist in South Korea who works with informants inside the North, said on Friday that he had not heard of any deaths from the coronavirus in the country.\n\nHe said the North Korean authorities had drastically stepped up border controls, even ordering guards to fire at those attempting to cross the border illegally. That draconian measure has made it impossible for groups like his to smuggle refugees out of North Korea, he said.\n\n\"North Korea has to take such an extreme step because their medical infrastructure is so bad that if an epidemic breaks out, it could run out of control,\" Mr. Kim said.\n\nThe coronavirus emerged as North Korea seemed to be retreating from a period of relative openness, with the diplomacy between Kim Jong-un and President Trump having produced no concrete agreements on ending the North's nuclear arms program or the international sanctions. In recent months, North Korea has opened resort towns in hopes of attracting Chinese visitors and badly needed tourist cash. But the coronavirus has halted that effort.\n\nMr. Kim, the pastor, said the prolonged border shutdown had already caused hardship for North Koreans who rely on trading and smuggling for a living. With goods smuggled from China getting more expensive, traders have begun hoarding commodities in the expectation of further price increases, he said.\n\nMr. Kim reported no civil disturbances but said the disruptions in border trade could hurt the national economy. More than 90 percent of North Korea's official external trade goes through China.\n\n\"North Korea is under increasing stress because of the coronavirus outbreak in China,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor in the international studies division at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. \"The revenue stream Kim was anticipating from tourism is running dry and the informal economy is suffering from draconian border and travel restrictions.\"\n\n\"North Korea may be on lockdown now, but it will soon be in need of economic concessions,\" he added.\n\nThat raises the possibility that Pyongyang could return to diplomacy -- or resume weapons tests to strengthen its negotiating hand, analysts said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

A Pupil's Progress.", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThirty minutes into the violin lesson, Anthea Kreston knew that something was wrong.\n\nMs. Kreston, an acclaimed American violinist, was at home in Corvallis, Oregon. Her student, Yunhe Tang, a talented 14-year-old who prefers the name Kevin, was at his home in Chengdu, in southwest China. She had been giving Kevin violin lessons via Skype once a week since last August, but today something was different. Kevin seemed lethargic, like he hadn't practiced, and Kevin always practiced.\n\n\"He said, 'Well, I'm not having lessons here, and I'm not going to school,\" Ms. Kreston said. \"And then he went, 'Everyone's sick.'\"\n\nIt did not take long for Ms. Kreston to realize Kevin's life had been affected by the coronavirus, even though he lived over 700 miles from Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak.\n\nChengdu is one of dozens of Chinese cities that are effectively on lockdown because of the virus. Schools are closed for the rest of the month and most businesses are struggling to reopen after being closed for weeks. Sichuan, the province of which Chengdu is the capital, had 436 confirmed cases of the virus as of Wednesday.\n\nKevin's family remains healthy, but Kevin has mostly been stuck inside.\n\nMs. Kreston said she couldn't stop thinking about Kevin shut up in the apartment, and decided to try and help take his mind off the virus. The day after the lesson earlier this month, she messaged Kevin and his family and asked if they would like to temporarily step up Kevin's lessons at no extra cost. As long as he was shut indoors, she wanted to have daily contact with him, and run a kind of violinist's boot camp during the coronavirus outbreak. The family agreed.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nKevin's challenge would be to learn a new concerto -- Lalo's \"Symphonie Espagnole\" -- in a few weeks, something she said would normally take 100 days. Ms. Kreston would also give him daily technical exercises to practice. She asked Kevin to record two videos a night to show he was doing the work, and send them to her.\n\n\"When you go out of that door, I want you to have something to show to everybody,\" Ms. Kreston recalled telling Kevin. \"This is such a gift to you,\" -- she added, trying to put a positive spin on having more time to practice. \"You can come out the strongest player ever,\" she added.\n\nKevin was scared when he first heard about the virus, he said in a Skype interview on Wednesday. \"I just wanted to wear my mask wherever I go, even when eating,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nHe realized how serious the situation was at the end of January when the family's Lunar New Year vacation to Chongqing, a city in the middle of China, was canceled. Kevin had been looking forward to playing his violin loudly outside every day. Instead, he had stayed home, watched news reports about the virus, and became nervous.\n\nKevin said the nerves passed quickly. His mother, who works at a hospital in Chengdu in its supplies department, told him as long as everyone's careful, they won't catch the virus.\n\nTwo weeks into the boot camp with Ms. Kreston, he is feeling much better, but longs for the outdoors. He is able to go into his apartment's yard to play basketball, but he misses swimming and playing water polo and board games with friends.\n\n\"I feel bored!\" he said while jumping from foot to foot as if filled with energy to burn.\n\nAlthough he is \"still very worried about Wuhan,\" Kevin said is not so concerned about his own city. He doesn't even worry about his mother, who has spent a lot of time recently buying masks and protective clothes for the hospital. \"We're often joking she's the most dangerous person in our home and we should keep her in the bathroom,\" he joked.\n\nKevin's improved mood has a lot to do with the daily violin lessons with Ms. Kreston, he said. The two of them don't just share videos back and forth, but also emoji messages about his violin playing.\n\nKevin now practices four hours every day, and he said his technique has improved and his sound has become more beautiful. Ms. Kreston said she gave Kevin the Lalo concerto because it was passionate at points and sad at others. Kevin could use it to tap into his feelings, even complicated ones about death and loss.\n\n\"The virus is terrible,\" Kevin said, \"but music gives us the confidence to overcome.\"", "source":

morning.\n\nWe're covering China's shifting approach to the coronavirus outbreak, the reshaping of Boris Johnson's cabinet and a key ally's reproach of President Trump.\n\nChina extends mass roundups of the ill\n\nMass roundups of the sick were extended to two Chinese cities beyond Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei Province.\n\nBut the large-scale quarantines in Wuhan have created confusion and frustration, and put some patients at even greater risk.\n\nConfirmed coronavirus patients showing mild symptoms are being massed together, while those suspected of being infected are being isolated in converted hotels and schools.\n\nThe latest: China is using its telecommunications firms, all state-run, to track users who may have visited Hubei. Japan confirmed its first death from the virus, which is the third outside mainland China.\n\nChanging numbers: China's shift to using CT scans to look for pneumonia rather than relying only on a positive test for the virus appears to have caused a sudden rise in the number of reported deaths and infections. Experts say the scans could catch many more cases. For now, the World Health Organization is continuing to rely only on confirmed test numbers.\n\nRemade, Boris Johnson's cabinet meets\n\nThe British prime minister faces a new dynamic among his top advisers this morning, after what was supposed to be a routine reshuffle turned into a seismic shift on Thursday.\n\nRishi Sunak, 39 and a relative newcomer to Parliament, will be the chancellor of the Exchequer, traditionally the second most powerful role in the government. He's replacing his former boss, Sajid Javid, who abruptly resigned rather than cede some of his power over economic policy to Mr. Johnson.\n\nTop politicians from a range of ministries had already been told to step aside by Mr. Johnson's officials, as the prime minister sought to provide a sense that his government was leaving behind three years of Brexit paralysis.\n\nMotive: Mr. Johnson, encouraged by his influential aide Dominic Cummings and his recent electoral victory, wants to control economic policy and direct resources to the north and middle of England, where voters traditionally loyal to Labour switched sides.\n\nMr. Johnson's office insisted that Mr. Javid fire his advisers, who would be replaced by a unit that would ultimately report to the prime minister. \"I don't believe any self-respecting minister would accept such conditions,\" Mr. Javid said.\n\nOther scrutiny for Johnson: The opposition Labour Party is demanding to know who paid for a luxury Caribbean vacation the prime minister and his partner took a few weeks ago. He declared its worth at \u00a315,000.\n\nA crucial Trump ally issues reproach\n\nIn a television interview on Thursday, the top U.S. law enforcement official, Attorney General William Barr, delivered a rebuke to President Trump.\n\nHe defended the role of the Justice Department in the handling of the legal case against Mr. Trump's longtime friend Roger Stone, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked. Mr. Barr's intervention in the case won him Mr. Trump's praise -- but shook federal prosecutors across the country.\n\n\"I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody,\" Mr. Barr said, adding, \"whether it's Congress, newspaper editorial boards or the president.\"\n\n\"I'm going to do what I think is right,\" he said. \"And, you know, I think I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\"\n\nSee for yourself: We transcribed the key moments of Mr. Barr's comments.\n\nAnother presidential rebuke: The Senate voted to require congressional approval for further attacks against Iran. Coming nearly six weeks after the U.S. military killed a top Iranian general, the vote was bipartisan but mostly symbolic, since the votes fell short of the number needed to override Mr. Trump's promised veto.\n\nIf you have 20 minutes, this is worth itA glimpse of the coastal future\n\nOur Climate reporters looked at the way the sprawling metropolitan areas of Manila, above left, and San Francisco, above right, are handling the climate crisis and rising sea levels.\n\nWill they try to redirect water to adapt to their needs, or reimagine their coastlines? Their decisions could offer crucial lessons for coastal cities around the world.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nHuawei charged: The Trump administration significantly ramped up a pressure campaign against the Chinese telecommunications giant by accusing it of federal racketeering and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\nThe 1619 Project: The Times Magazine looked at the locations in the United States where enslaved people were bought and sold. Today, many of those sites are forgotten and unmarked.\n\nSnapshot: Above, a human chain to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the bombing in Dresden on Thursday. The destruction has become fodder for members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.\n\nPerspective: Our Opinion columnist David Brooks argues that the United States could learn a lot from Scandinavia's \"generations of phenomenal educational policy.\"\n\nWhat we're listening to: This week's episode of \"The New Yorker Radio Hour.\" Sam Sifton, our food editor, writes: \"I enjoyed listening to Hilton Als talk about Louis C.K.'s return to the stage, and about how it might have gone differently, had Louis attempted art and not commerce.\"\n\nNow, a break from the news\n\nCook: Take time this weekend for stuffed shells.\n\nRead: \"Open Book,\" a memoir by the entertainer Jessica Simpson, is a No. 1 debut this week on our hardcover nonfiction and combined print and e-book nonfiction best-seller lists.\n\nSmarter Living: There are good ways and bad ways for colleagues with different circadian rhythms to approach working together. Here are some tips.\n\nAnd now for the Back Story on ...Reporting on the coronavirus\n\nDonald G. McNeil Jr., a science reporter for The New York Times, has covered infectious diseases since 2002. He's part of a team of science reporters working to make sense of the spread of the latest coronavirus and the medical response. The following is a condensed version of a conversation about his observations and concerns.\n\nWhat do we know, and what don't we know, about the coronavirus?\n\nIn the beginning of every epidemic, there is the fog of war.\n\nI'd say we're still in that fog. We know this virus is much more transmissible than SARS or MERS. We don't know if it's quite as transmissible as the flu. We know it can kill people. We know it's not nearly as lethal as MERS or SARS.\n\nOne of the things we don't know is what the Chinese aren't saying. We know that they're reluctant to let in outside experts to root around and wouldn't share samples of the earliest cases with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhen you ask scientists, \"What's your fear for the Big One, the pandemic that's going to kill us all?\" -- not that there is a pandemic that's going to kill us all -- but if you ask them that, they say, \"Flu.\" They worry about some new flu, bird flu or swine flu, that's highly lethal but becomes very transmissible between humans. I know only one or two scientists who have said, \"You know, I also worry about coronaviruses being the Big One.\"\n\nI don't want to raise alarm that this is the Big One. But this is a new, scary and confusing one, and we don't yet know how far it's going to spread and how many people it's going to kill.\n\nWhat do you think about the public's reaction to your reporting?\n\nI'm always trying to figure out: Am I being alarmist, or am I not being alarmist enough? I was too alarmist about H5N1 back in 2005, the bird flu. I was not alarmist enough about West Africa and Ebola in its early days. All previous Ebola outbreaks had killed a few hundred people. That one killed 11,000.\n\nA big part of my beat is debunking the panicky stories. It actually consumes almost as much of my time as reporting does.\n\nI try to spread truth instead of panic, even if it takes me a little longer to get it right.\n\nThat's it for this briefing. Hope you have a great (and healthy) weekend.\n\n-- Andrea\n\nThank you\n\nTo Mark Josephson and Kathleen Massara for the break from the news. Alex Traub wrote today's Back Story.

China Seeks Plasma Donors to Develop Treatment", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nREAD UPDATES IN CHINESE: \u65b0\u51a0\u75c5\u6bd2\u75ab\u60c5\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\u6c47\u603b\n\nHere's what you need to know:China calls on virus survivors to donate blood plasma in the hopes of creating a treatment.China records more than 5,000 new cases in 24 hours.Japan Announces $96 million in emergency funds to help deal with the fallout.China calls on virus survivors to donate blood plasma in the hopes of creating a treatment.\n\nA senior health official in Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak, has called on residents who have recovered from the coronavirus to donate blood plasma, believing their naturally produced antibodies could be used to treat patients who are still sick.\n\nDr. Zhang Dingyu, the director of the Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, made his appeal on Friday. Chinese researchers said they believed such antibody treatments could help people recover from the virus.\n\nThe search for a drug capable of treating or curing the virus has frustrated researchers, as rates of infection and deaths continue to mount.\n\nThe government is currently prescribing a combination of anti-viral drugs and traditional Chinese medicine. But on Thursday, China National Biotec Group, a state-owned company under the Ministry of Health, said it found that administering a round of human antibodies from the survivors to more than 10 critically ill patients caused inflammation levels to drop significantly after 12 to 24 hours of treatment.\n\nThe company called the use of plasma \"the most effective method, which can significantly reduce the mortality of critically ill patients.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nBenjamin Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, said the use of antibodies to treat the coronavirus is \"a really good idea,\" noting that it's been used before in influenza pandemics. But he cautioned that it needed to be proven in a controlled trial.\n\n\"It's basically transferring immunity from a patient who has recovered to a patient still fighting the infection, and then helping them to recover,\" he said.\n\nChina records more than 5,000 new cases in 24 hours.\n\nNumbers continued to climb after the government changed the criteria by which it tracks confirmed cases. China on Friday reported 5,090 new coronavirus cases and 121 new deaths in the previous 24 hours.\n\nThe authorities said a total of 63,851 people have been infected by the coronavirus and at least 1,380 people have been killed by the disease. Most of the cases occurred in Hubei, the center of the outbreak, which recorded 4,823 new cases and 116 deaths over the same period.\n\nThe tally in Hubei jumped most dramatically on Thursday after the authorities changed the diagnostic criteria for counting new cases. The government now takes into account cases diagnosed in clinical settings, including the use of CT scans, and not just those confirmed with specialized testing kits.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has sickened more than 64,400 people in China and 24 other countries.\n\nJapan Announces $96 million in emergency funds to help deal with the fallout.\n\nJapan said Friday that it will allocate around $96 million in emergency funds to help deal with the fallout from the coronavirus, a decision that comes after the country confirmed its first death related to the illness.\n\nThe Japanese cabinet approved the modest funds to strengthen countermeasures against the disease and provide support for small and medium sized businesses that are struggling with low sales amid a drop in visitors from China, the main source of tourism in Japan.\n\nJapan has the largest number of positive diagnoses of the coronavirus outside of China. And it has been struggling to deal with the management of 3,700 people who were exposed to the illness while aboard the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship that is currently under quarantine in Yokohama.\n\nHundreds of people have tested positive for the illness and been taken off the ship and transported to hospitals, while many more remain in isolation on the ship, where they are expected to stay until the end of the quarantine period on Feb 19.\n\nThe cabinet's decision to approve the emergency funds comes after the death of a woman in her 80s in Japan's Kanagawa Prefecture and the announcement of several more cases that do not appear to be directly linked to the cruise ship or individuals who had recently traveled to China.\n\nFriday morning, authorities said they had confirmed a new case: a man in his 70s in Wakayama Prefecture who had been treated by a doctor who himself had contracted the coronavirus.\n\nReporting and research was contributed by Sui-Lee Wee, Amber Wang,

Y los productores, las mineras y los fabricantes de productos b\u00e1sicos de todo tipo est\u00e1n considerando si se ver\u00e1n obligados a retrasar la producci\u00f3n por temor a saturar sus inventarios.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air.

How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nLas tribulaciones en los mercados de las materias primas -- se puede decir que son el activo que peor se ha desempe\u00f1ado en los mercados financieros este a\u00f1o -- reflejan una realidad b\u00e1sica: China, con su econom\u00eda acentuadamente industrial, es el consumidor m\u00e1s importante de materias primas del planeta.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, los esfuerzos dr\u00e1sticos para apaciguar el brote, incluido el cierre de Wuhan, una ciudad de 11 millones de habitantes, y las graves restricciones en el transporte a lo largo de todo el pa\u00eds, han desacelerado la econom\u00eda china de manera marcada.\n\nLos economistas de JPMorgan ahora piensan que la econom\u00eda de China crecer\u00e1 a un ritmo de solo un uno por ciento en el primer trimestre, una ca\u00edda importante de una predicci\u00f3n inicial que anticipaba una tasa del 6,3 por ciento.\n\nLa recesi\u00f3n ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s pronunciada en el sector industrial. La mayor\u00eda de las provincias chinas extendieron la celebraci\u00f3n del A\u00f1o Nuevo lunar y mantuvieron cerradas las f\u00e1bricas hasta el lunes 10 de febrero en un esfuerzo por contener el virus. Algunas han reabierto, pero podr\u00edan pasar semanas o meses antes de que la producci\u00f3n pueda aumentar por completo.\n\nEste es el desaf\u00edo m\u00e1s importante para las cadenas de suministro que se han desarrollado en d\u00e9cadas recientes para entregar un suministro continuo de materiales que hacen bullir a las f\u00e1bricas chinas.\n\nLos mercados de productos b\u00e1sicos han dado traspi\u00e9s a medida que esas f\u00e1bricas han permanecido improductivas. El mineral de hierro disminuy\u00f3 en m\u00e1s de un 10 por ciento este a\u00f1o. El cobre, cerca de un 8 por ciento, al igual que el n\u00edquel, un componente b\u00e1sico del acero inoxidable. El zinc y el aluminio han disminuido en m\u00e1s de un 5 por ciento en 2020.\n\n\"Hay una enorme ca\u00edda en el consumo y se necesita espacio de almacenamiento\", coment\u00f3 Harry Tchilinguirian, director de estrategia de productos b\u00e1sicos en el banco franc\u00e9s BNP Paribas, ubicado en Londres. \"Y si no tienes espacio de almacenamiento, esa es una de las razones por las que los compradores est\u00e1n invocando esta cl\u00e1usula\".\n\nUno de los mayores importadores de gas natural licuado de China, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), es una de las compa\u00f1\u00edas que ha invocado la cl\u00e1usula de \"fuerza mayor\", seg\u00fan m\u00faltiples informes de noticias. En consecuencia, los precios del gas asi\u00e1tico cayeron y los precios de referencia para el gas natural l\u00edquido del norte de Asia han ca\u00eddo m\u00e1s del 30 por ciento en 2020.\n\nLos precios del cobre tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n en riesgo porque las industrias de la construcci\u00f3n y automotriz de China se han estancado. BHP dijo que estaba monitoreando la situaci\u00f3n y que estaba \"trabajando de manera estrecha con nuestros clientes de cobre\".\n\nPara algunos expertos, la disminuci\u00f3n del cobre puede ser un signo ominoso: el cobre, gracias a su conexi\u00f3n directa con el sector industrial, se ha considerado durante mucho tiempo un indicador no oficial pero crucial del rumbo de la econom\u00eda mundial.\n\nQue la recesi\u00f3n sea un incidente pasajero o una sacudida grave depende tanto de la epidemiolog\u00eda como de la econom\u00eda.\n\nSi la propagaci\u00f3n del virus comienza a disminuir -- como muchos esperan que suceda -- lo m\u00e1s probable es que los productos b\u00e1sicos se recuperen hasta llegar a su estado normal y los inventarios que se han acumulado en las \u00faltimas semanas disminuyan gradualmente.\n\n\"Mucho de lo que ha pasado con algunos de los precios de estos productos b\u00e1sicos es m\u00e1s especulaci\u00f3n de que la situaci\u00f3n empeore antes de mejorar\", coment\u00f3 John LaForge, director de estrategias de activos reales en el Instituto de Inversi\u00f3n de Wells Fargo. \"Mi predicci\u00f3n es que los precios de los productos b\u00e1sicos se recuperar\u00e1n muy r\u00e1pido\", asever\u00f3.\n\nOtros no est\u00e1n tan seguros.\n\nMorse, de Citigroup, dijo que varios mercados clave -- como el del petr\u00f3leo crudo -- ya hab\u00edan mostrado debilidad, lo cual suger\u00eda que la econom\u00eda mundial era d\u00e9bil incluso desde antes de que el brote del virus apareciera.

"Some Wuhan Evacuees Ask Why They Aren't Being Tested for the Coronavirus", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nLOS ANGELES -- When 195 Americans, including diplomats, were evacuated from Wuhan, China, last month, they were tested for the coronavirus on arrival at a California military base. Health officials swabbed the throats and noses of everyone in the group -- the first to be evacuated from Wuhan -- and they were relieved when all of their tests came back negative.\n\nBut as more government-arranged flights evacuated Americans from China in the days that followed, the federal health authorities adopted a new protocol: Only people who showed symptoms of illness during a 14-day quarantine period would be tested. For some among the more than 600 people who are still waiting to be cleared to go home from military bases in three states, the new rule has left them worried -- and angry. Some are pleading with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test them for the coronavirus.\n\n\"We are not asking for skateboards or toys,\" said Jacob Wilson, 33, one of more than 30 people in quarantine on a base in San Diego who signed a petition this week calling for tests. \"We are asking to get tested and make sure we are not passing anything to other people.\"\n\nThe concerns come as three people in quarantine on bases in San Diego and San Antonio, Texas, tested positive for the virus, which has killed more than a thousand people in China but so far has been found to have infected only 15 people in the United States.\n\nAt Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, where 232 people are waiting out a government-mandated two-week quarantine, some evacuees said they worried that they and their children had spent days mingling with people -- in an eating area, on a playground and in a laundry room -- and would like to know for sure whether or not they have the virus.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak How Is the U.S. Being Affected?\n\nUpdated Feb.13, 2020\n\nFifteen cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the United States, including a 35-year-old man in Washington State, a couple in their 60s in Chicago and eight people in California. One of the people evacuated from Wuhan last week to San Diego had coronavirus but was discharged because of a labeling error. Some testing kits sent to states are flawed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pittsburgh, Wuhan's \"sister city,\" has been shaken by the outbreak and is sending aid to relatives and friends trapped in the center of a deadly outbreak. Hundreds of Americans evacuated from Wuhan arrived on military bases, where they were expected to remain in quarantine for days. There was a race to contain the disease after one man's cough became confirmation of America's first case. Many who recently traveled to China are isolating themselves in 'self quarantines' for 14 days. A high school exchange student may have been among the last Americans to arrive home in time to avoid the mandated quarantine. Mask hoarders may increase the risk of an outbreak in the U.S. Health care workers risk infection if they cannot get the protective gear. Most experts agree: To protect yourself wash your hands and avoid touching your face. Tips to not get sick while traveling. Affected by travel? Or do you know someone who is? Please contact us at coronavirus@nytimes.com if you are willing to be contacted by a reporter or have your comments used for a coming story.\n\n\"We believe testing everyone at the facility would help identify potential suspects as early as possible, so the appropriate treatment could be put in place,\" the evacuees wrote in the petition, which they called a \"suggestion letter\" and shared with one another over WeChat, a Chinese instant-messaging app.\n\nThe C.D.C., however, has declined to test every evacuee. Officials said that such tests are less accurate before people show symptoms, so a negative early result could be misleading rather than helpful. The agency tested everyone on the first evacuation flight, the officials said, because they were learning about the virus and because doing so allowed them to collect more data about it. Since then, they said, they have determined that swabbing hundreds of seemingly healthy people is not useful.\n\n\"Every test has a limit of detection,\" said Dr. Joseph Bresee, the associate director of global health affairs for the C.D.C.'s influenza division. \"Early on, the test may or may not be able to pick it up.\"\n\nAlmost everyone who gets sick from the virus will show symptoms within 14 days of exposure, often early within that window, Dr. Bresee said. Evacuees on military bases are having their temperature checked at least twice a day and are asked to alert health officials if they feel sick or if their temperature rises.\n\nDr. Bresee said that he empathized with evacuees who want definitive answers about whether they are healthy.\n\n\"They're concerned, they're nervous, and they want to be assured of their safety,\" he said, adding that the cost of testing was not a factor in the decision not to test everyone. \"We don't think testing would be helpful, and if we did, we would test them.\"\n\nAbout 1,000 Americans are believed to live in Wuhan, where the outbreak began. As the number of confirmed cases soared and commercial carriers suspended flights out of the city, the United States began chartering planes to bring home citizens who were stranded there.\n\nOn the San Diego base, where evacuees have been waiting since last week, not everyone was calling for more testing. John McGory, who is among the group, said some people did not support the petition. Some in the group said fears had been blown out of proportion and that the C.D.C.'s approach seemed reasonable.\n\nThe C.D.C. on Thursday announced the latest confirmed coronavirus case in the United States as having been identified among the evacuees at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. The person had been under quarantine on the base until symptoms emerged. The person was taken to a hospital and was stable with mild symptoms, the C.D.C. said. In announcing the new case, the C.D.C. said there would likely be more confirmed cases in the coming days.\n\nAt the San Diego base, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, Mr. Wilson and others said that people had to leave their rooms to get breakfast, lunch and dinner from a small room, which is also where their temperatures were taken. People rummaged through boxes of fruit and snacks with their bare hands, he said, and they stood shoulder to shoulder in line waiting to check their temperatures despite being told to stay six feet away from one another.\n\nAfter the petition was circulated, health officials agreed as of Thursday to deliver meals and take temperatures at the room doors of evacuees who preferred it that way.\n\n\"The reality is, it's impossible for us to keep any distance from each other,\" said Mr. Wilson, a tech entrepreneur in Wuhan. He and others also said officials had not required evacuees to wear masks.\n\nEarlier in the week, a labeling error led the authorities to return an ill woman to the base from a San Diego hospital, though a test later showed that she had the coronavirus. The mistake raised new worries among some evacuees. The C.D.C. had erroneously informed the hospital that the woman had tested negative for the virus when, in fact, her samples had not been tested. Health officials have tried to calm concerns, saying the woman had been isolated from other evacuees before returning to the hospital.\n\nDr. Bresee said that health officials were learning more about the virus each day, but that there were no plans to change testing procedures for the hundreds in quarantine.\n\n\"As we learn more, we may pivot,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean we were wrong once and are right now, it just means we're learning.\"\n\nMiriam Jordan reported from Los Angeles, and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs from New York.

"title": "China Expands Chaotic Dragnet in Coronavirus Crackdown", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nChina's leaders expanded a mass roundup of people possibly sickened with the coronavirus on Thursday, widening their dragnet well beyond the epicenter of the outbreak to at least two more cities in what the government has called a \"wartime\" campaign to stamp out the epidemic.\n\nBut the campaign, first announced last week in the city of Wuhan, already has been marred by chaotic conditions that have isolated vulnerable patients without adequate care and, in some cases, left them alone to die.\n\nThe expansion of the decree to \"round up everyone who should be rounded up\" in the Wuhan area of central China has deepened the nation's sense of anxiety.\n\nIn their zeal to execute the edict, officials in Wuhan, a metropolis of 11 million, have haphazardly seized patients who have not yet tested positive for the coronavirus, in some cases herding them onto buses with no protective measures where they risked infection from others, their relatives said.\n\nAfter that, patients have been sent to makeshift medical facilities that don't provide the support they need to recover. With little to no dedicated medical staff on hand to help, some patients die.\n\nOne woman was abruptly carted off to a quarantine facility and prohibited from retrieving her supply of heart medication, her daughter-in-law said. A man said he was getting sicker and sicker in his hotel room, but there were no doctors and he was not allowed to leave.\n\nAnother man placed in a makeshift shelter fell into a coma for two days, but his family said they couldn't get him admitted to a hospital. He died.\n\nDespite the upheaval, the mass roundup extended beyond Wuhan to include other cities in central Hubei Province that have been hit hard by the outbreak. The state-run CCTV news broadcaster said the expanded area included the cities of Huanggang and Xiaogan.\n\nA sudden spike in new cases could make the situation worse. Officials in Hubei Province announced on Thursday that they had expanded the criteria for counting new infections to include diagnoses by doctors based on a chest scan and symptoms, rather than a more complicated test. The tally from the outbreak surged as a result, with the province adding nearly 15,000 new cases and 242 new deaths in a single day.\n\nThe sharp rise in confirmed cases, to more than 48,000 in the province, could overwhelm an already burdened health care system, which faces a shortage of hospital beds and medical supplies. Even before the new numbers were reported, many residents had been slipping through the cracks.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nOne Wuhan resident, Peng Andong, 59, had been suffering from a persistent fever and lung infection for days when his local neighborhood committee told him to go to a makeshift quarantine site last week.\n\nMr. Peng and his family were told that there would be doctors at the quarantine site, as well as test kits so he could get the official confirmation needed to receive proper treatment. So on Feb. 5, Mr. Peng boarded a bus full of sick patients -- none wearing protective gear -- and was driven to a hotel converted into an isolation center.\n\nFor several days, Mr. Peng messaged with his relatives regularly, updating them on the tumultuous conditions inside the hotel.\n\n\"He said it was really chaotic in the first few days and there was no food or medical staff there,\" said Peng Bangze, his son. Others have described similar conditions in interviews and in calls for help posted on social media.\n\nDeng Chao, 30, said that although doctors had told him he almost certainly had the coronavirus, he hadn't yet received the official results from the test that is needed for hospital admission.\n\nInstead he was sent to a Wuhan hotel where he has been in a government-imposed quarantine for nearly a week. Now, he said, he was getting progressively sicker and finding it more difficult to breathe. He said security guards had been stationed at the hotel entrance to prevent patients from escaping -- and there were no doctors or medicine.\n\n\"This is really like a prison,\" Mr. Deng said.\n\n\"Send me to a hospital, please, I need treatment,\" he said, in between bouts of coughing. \"There is no one to take care of us here.\"\n\nThe problems are likely to compound the public outrage over the government's response to the coronavirus outbreak, the most serious health crisis to afflict China under President Xi Jinping. Local officials played down the virus in the early days, while the eventual lockdown of Wuhan cut the city off from critical supplies and resources.\n\nIn a sign of an aggressive effort by Mr. Xi to contain the political and economic damage of the epidemic, the Chinese Communist Party on Thursday fired the leaders of Hubei Province and Wuhan.\n\nGlobal reverberations from the coronavirus crisis have shown no sign of slowing.\n\nOn Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States said a person under quarantine at a military base in San Antonio had tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the United States to 15.\n\nIn Japan, health officials announced the first death from the virus in the country, a woman in her 80s in Kanagawa Prefecture, which includes Yokohama, where more than 200 passengers on a quarantined luxury cruise ship have been infected by the coronavirus.\n\nWuhan Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Spread of the Outbreak\n\nThe virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and a number of other countries.\n\nThe Chinese government's drive to corral people into makeshift medical facilities in Wuhan began earlier this month, as it became clear that patients were infecting family members after being told to quarantine at home. Desperate officials hastily devised plans to convert stadiums, exhibition centers, hotels and schools into temporary medical centers for thousands who could not get admitted to a hospital.\n\nConfirmed coronavirus patients with mild symptoms were put in large converted spaces. Suspected cases went to requisitioned hotels and schools to be isolated. The close contacts of confirmed cases and patients with fevers who could have been infected were also put in separate facilities. Some confirmed cases with serious symptoms have been transferred to two newly built hospitals dedicated to treating coronavirus patients.\n\nDespite some complaints about the scarcity of toilets and concerns among experts about the potential for cross-infections, some patients in such venues say they are mostly satisfied with the conditions, and are relieved to be out of their homes where they were worried about infecting relatives. Images circulated from inside the centers show patients dancing and lying in beds playing on their phones. One patient was even photographed reading Francis Fukuyama's \"The Origins of Political Order.\"\n\nBut in many cases, the effort appears disjointed and disorganized. A report by the official Xinhua news agency said that because of the \"limitations\" of some quarantine sites, sometimes two or three patients with suspected cases were housed in the same room.\n\nAnother Xinhua report detailed how community workers doing door-to-door checks had to talk to neighbors and check on clues like hanging laundry to ensure every household in Wuhan was counted. Even The Global Times, the nationalistic party newspaper, reported on the frustrations of a public bus driver who tried in the middle of the night to round up people suspected to have infections.\n\nPatients and their relatives have complained about the dismal conditions, particularly in venues where patients need isolation and medical attention.\n\nOn Feb. 8, just two days after her husband was admitted to the hospital for coronavirus, doctors told Ma Xilian, 59, she likely had it, too, based on a chest scan and symptoms. She was told to immediately report to a designated quarantine site for isolation. Her requests to go home to retrieve her heart medication were denied.\n\nIn the converted hotel where Ms. Ma was sequestered for days before she finally secured a hospital room, there were no doctors, medicine or even water, according to a plea for help posted by her daughter-in-law on Chinese social media, one of many similar calls for assistance that have surfaced online in recent weeks.\n\n\"Where have your feelings for the people gone?\" she wrote, castigating local government officials. \"Where have your governance capabilities gone?\"\n\nSome say that the lack of medical care in the makeshift quarantine centers has only made their illnesses worse. For some families, the poor conditions have led to the worst news.\n\nPeng Bangze, whose father was sent on a crowded bus to a converted hotel for isolation, recalled visiting last Saturday, after his father had been unreachable all day.\n\nHe found his father in a comatose state alone in his room.\n\nPanicked, he called for help. When the ambulance came, both the driver and the hotel security guard refused to help him move his father, a construction worker, into the vehicle for fear of getting infected, the son said. One hour later, the son was told that the hospital had no bed for his father and that he should go home and wait.\n\nTwo days -- and many phone calls -- later, Mr. Peng's relatives finally received a call from the local government notifying them that a hospital bed had been arranged. But when Mr. Peng's son arrived at the hotel to help with the transfer, his father was lying face down on the bed, lifeless, in the same position he had left him.\n\nThe workers at the isolation venue had no explanation. They disinfected the room, the father's body was removed for cremation, and the son collected his belongings.\n\n\"I don't know how this happened,\" the son said. \"It all happened in a few days. How could he suddenly be gone?\"\n\nAlbee Zhang and Zoe Mou contributed research from Beijing.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/world/coronavirus-timeline.html", "title": "A Timeline of the Coronavirus", "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe coronavirus, which surfaced in a Chinese seafood and poultry market late last year, has spread to 24 countries, killing more than 1,000 and sickening tens of thousands of people in a matter of weeks. The World Health Organization has declared the situation a global health emergency.\n\nHere's a timeline of what we know so far about the outbreak.\n\nDec. 31\n\nChinese authorities were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause.\n\nOn Dec. 31, the government in Wuhan, China, confirmed that health authorities were treating dozens of cases. Days later, researchers in China identified a new virus behind an illness that had infected dozens of people in Asia. At the time, there was no evidence that the virus was readily spread by humans. Health officials in China were monitoring it to ensure that the outbreak would not develop into something more severe.\n\nJan. 11\n\nChina reported its first death.\n\nOn Jan. 11, Chinese state media reported the first known death from the disease caused by the virus, which had infected dozens of people in China. The 61-year-old man who died was a regular customer at the market in Wuhan, where the illness is thought to have originated, and he had previously been found to have abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease. The report of his death came just before one of China's biggest holidays, when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country.\n\nJan. 20\n\nOther countries, including the United States, confirmed cases.\n\nThe first confirmed cases of the coronavirus outside mainland China occurred in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, according to the World Health Organization's first situation report published on Jan. 20. The first confirmed case in the United States came the next day in Washington State, where a man in his 30s developed symptoms after returning from a trip to Wuhan.\n\nJan. 23\n\nWuhan, a city of more than 11 million, was cut off by Chinese authorities.\n\nAfter Chinese officials urged people not to travel to or from Wuhan, severe travel restrictions were put in place. On Jan. 23, the authorities closed off Wuhan by canceling planes and trains leaving the city, and suspending buses, subways and ferries within it. At this point, at least 17 people had died and more than 570 others had been infected, including in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the United States.\n\nJan. 30\n\nThe World Health Organization declared a global health emergency.\n\nAmid thousands of new cases in China, a \"public health emergency of international concern\" was officially declared on Jan. 30 by the World Health Organization. The country's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said that China would continue to work with the W.H.O. and other countries to protect public health, and the U.S. State Department warned travelers to avoid China.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nJan. 31\n\nAirlines suspended service to China, while the Trump administration restricted entry into the U.S.\n\nOn Jan. 31, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines said they would suspend service, for at least two months, between the United States and mainland China. The Trump administration said it would suspend entry into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the last 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents. By this date, 213 people had died and nearly 9,800 had been infected worldwide.\n\nFeb. 2\n\nThe first coronavirus death was reported outside China.\n\nA 44-year-old man in the Philippines died after being infected by the coronavirus, officials said on Feb. 2. The man's death was the first reported outside China. By this point, the number of deaths had risen to more than 360.\n\nFeb. 5\n\nHundreds, mostly Americans, were evacuated from Hubei Province.\n\nAbout 350 people, mostly Americans, who were evacuated from Hubei Province in China, arrived in California on Feb. 5. The group would be held at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, Calif., and at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego for 14 days, which is the maximum time it takes a person to become sick after being exposed to the coronavirus. By Feb. 13, the number of coronavirus cases in the United States had risen to 15 in seven states.\n\nFeb. 5\n\nA cruise ship in Japan quarantined thousands.\n\nOn Feb. 5, after a two-week trip to Southeast Asia, more than 3,600 passengers began their 14-day quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan. Officials began screening passengers, and the number of people who tested positive became the largest number of coronavirus cases outside of China. By Feb. 13, the number stood at 218.\n\nFeb. 7\n\nA Chinese doctor, who tried to warn others, died from the coronavirus.\n\nWhen Dr. Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor, died on Feb. 7 after contracting the coronavirus, he was hailed as a hero by many for his attempt to ring early alarms that a cluster of infections could spin out of control.\n\nIn early January, the authorities tried to silence him when he was called in by both medical officials and the police, and he was forced to sign a statement denouncing his warning as an unfounded and illegal rumor. Dr. Li's death provoked anger and frustration at how the Chinese government mishandled the situation by not sharing information earlier and by silencing whistle-blowers.\n\nFeb. 10\n\nThe death toll in China surpassed the number SARS killed worldwide.\n\nOn Feb. 10, the death toll in China rose to 908, surpassing the global number of dead from the SARS epidemic in 2002-3, which killed 774. At this point, the number of confirmed cases of infection in the country had risen to 40,171.\n\nFeb. 11\n\nThe death toll in China topped 1,000.\n\nChinese officials said the death toll had reached 1,016 while the number of infections had grown to 42,638 on Feb. 11. A U.S. citizen died in Wuhan, officials said on Feb. 8; it was the first known American death.\n\nFeb. 13\n\nThe Communist Party fired top officials of Hubei Province and Wuhan.\n\nChina's ruling Community Party ousted Jiang Chaoliang, the party secretary of Hubei Province, and Ma Guoqiang, the top official in Wuhan, on Feb. 13 amid widespread public outrage over the handling of the outbreak.\n\nFeb. 13\n\nThere were more than 14,000 new cases in Hubei Province.\n\nOfficials on Feb. 13 added more than 14,840 new cases to the total number of infected in Hubei Province. That set a daily record, coming after officials in Hubei seemed to be including infections diagnosed by using lung scans of symptomatic patients.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Outbreak\n\nShortly after the University of Washington announced that the school's fourth suspected case of the new coronavirus had turned out negative, two professors, one of public policy and the other of public health, held a small dinner for students and faculty members.\n\nLike everywhere else on campus, and in much of the world, the coronavirus was all anybody could talk about.\n\nBut one of the attendees, a public health student, had had enough. Exasperated, she rattled off a set of statistics.\n\nThe virus had killed about 1,100 worldwide and infected around a dozen in the United States. Alarming, but a much more common illness, influenza, kills about 400,000 people every year, including 34,200 Americans last flu season and 61,099 the year before.\n\nThere remains deep uncertainty about the new coronavirus' mortality rate, with the high-end estimate that it is up to 20 times that of the flu, but some estimates go as low as 0.16 percent for those affected outside of China's overwhelmed Hubei province. About on par with the flu.\n\nWasn't there something strange, the student asked, about the extreme disparity in public reactions?\n\nAnn Bostrom, the dinner's public policy co-host, laughed when she recounted the evening. The student was right about the viruses, but not about people, said Dr. Bostrom, who is an expert on the psychology of how humans evaluate risk.\n\nWhile the metrics of public health might put the flu alongside or even ahead of the new coronavirus for sheer deadliness, she said, the mind has its own ways of measuring danger. And the new coronavirus disease, named COVID-19 hits nearly every cognitive trigger we have.\n\nThat explains the global wave of anxiety.\n\nOf course, it is far from irrational to feel some fear about the coronavirus outbreak tearing through China and beyond.\n\nBut there is a lesson, psychologists and public health experts say, in the near-terror that the virus induces, even as serious threats like the flu receive little more than a shrug. It illustrates the unconscious biases in how human beings think about risk, as well as the impulses that often guide our responses -- sometimes with serious consequences.\n\nHow Our Brains Evaluate Threat\n\nExperts used to believe that people gauged risk like actuaries, parsing out cost-benefit analyses every time a merging car came too close or local crime rates spiked. But a wave of psychological experiments in the 1980s upended this thinking.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak What do you need to know? Start here.\n\nUpdated Feb. 10, 2020\n\nWhat is a Coronavirus?\n\nIt is a novel virus named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people, and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more dangerous conditions like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. How contagious is the virus?\n\nAccording to preliminary research, it seems moderately infectious, similar to SARS, and is possibly transmitted through the air. Scientists have estimated that each infected person could spread it to somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 people without effective containment measures. Where has the virus spread?\n\nThe virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has sickened tens of thousands of people in China and at least two dozen other countries. How worried should I be?\n\nWhile the virus is a serious public health concern, the risk to most people outside China remains very low, and seasonal flu is a more immediate threat. Who is working to contain the virus?\n\nWorld Health Organization officials have praised China's aggressive response to the virus by closing transportation, schools and markets. This week, a team of experts from the W.H.O. arrived in Beijing to offer assistance. What if I'm traveling?\n\nThe United States and Australia are temporarily denying entry to noncitizens who recently traveled to China and several airlines have canceled flights. How do I keep myself and others safe?\n\nWashing your hands frequently is the most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you're sick.\n\nResearchers found that people use a set of mental shortcuts for measuring danger. And they tend to do it unconsciously, meaning that instinct can play a much larger role than they realize.\n\nThe world is full of risks, big and small. Ideally, these shortcuts help people figure out which ones to worry about and which to disregard. But they can be imperfect.\n\nThe coronavirus may be a case in point.\n\n\"This hits all the hot buttons that lead to heightened risk perception,\" said Paul Slovic, a University of Oregon psychologist who helped pioneer modern risk psychology.\n\nWhen you encounter a potential risk, your brain does a quick search for past experiences with it. If it can easily pull up multiple alarming memories, then your brain concludes the danger is high. But it often fails to assess whether those memories are truly representative.\n\nA classic example is airplane crashes.\n\nIf two happen in quick succession, flying suddenly feels scarier -- even if your conscious mind knows that those crashes are a statistical aberration with little bearing on the safety of your next flight. But if you then take a few flights and nothing goes wrong, your brain will most likely start telling you again that flying is safe.\n\nWhen it comes to the coronavirus, Dr. Slovic said, it's as if people are experiencing one report after another of planes crashing.\n\n\"We're hearing about the fatalities,\" he said. \"We're not hearing about the 98 or so percent of people who are recovering from it and may have had mild cases.\"\n\nThat tendency can cut in both directions, leading not to undue alarm but undue complacency. Though flu kills tens of thousands of Americans every year, most peoples' experiences with it are relatively mundane.\n\nBeing told how dangerous flu is does little to change this, studies find. The brain's risk assessment approach simply overwhelms rational calculation -- a source of endless consternation to health officials trying to raise flu vaccination rates.\n\n\"We're conditioned by our experiences,\" Dr. Slovic said. \"But experience can mislead us to be too comfortable with things.\"\n\nBiases, Shortcuts and Gut Instincts\n\nThe coronavirus also taps into other psychological shortcuts for assessing risk.\n\nOne involves novelty: We are conditioned to focus heavily on new threats, looking for any cause for alarm. This can lead us to obsess over the scariest reports and worst-case scenarios, making the danger seem bigger still.\n\nMaybe the most powerful shortcut of all is emotion.\n\nAssessing the danger posed by the coronavirus is extraordinarily difficult; even scientists are unsure. But our brains act as if they have an easier way: They translate gut emotional reactions into what, we believe are reasoned conclusions, even if hard data tells us otherwise.\n\n\"The world in our heads is not a precise replica of reality,\" Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, wrote in a 2011 book. \"Our expectations about the frequency of events are distorted by the prevalence and emotional intensity of the messages to which we are exposed.\"\n\nIn extreme cases, this can lead to a \"crowding-out effect,\" Dr. Bostrom said, as our emotional impulses overwhelm our cognitive faculties. The coronavirus hits a number of those triggers, often quite hard.\n\nOne is dread.\n\nIf a risk seems especially painful or disturbing, people tend to raise their estimate of how likely it is to happen to them. Reports on the coronavirus often feature upsetting imagery: unhygienic food markets, city-scale lockdowns and overcrowded hospitals.\n\nAnother trigger is a threat that is not fully understood. The less known it is, the more people may fear it, and overestimate its threat.\n\nThreats that feel out of control, like a runaway disease outbreak, prompt a similar response, leading people to seek ways to reimpose control, for instance by hoarding supplies.\n\nRisks that we take on voluntarily, or that at least feel voluntary, are often seen as less dangerous than they really are. One study found that the danger people increases by a factor of one thousand if they it as a choice.\n\nIf that number sounds high, consider that driving, a danger most take on voluntarily, kills over 40,000 Americans every year. But terrorism, a threat imposed on us, kills fewer than 100.\n\nThere are countless rational reasons that terrorism provokes a sharper response than traffic deaths. The same goes for a fast-spreading and little-understood outbreak versus the familiar flu.\n\nAnd that is exactly the point, psychologists say.\n\n\"All of these things play on our feelings,\" Dr. Slovic said. \"And that's the representation of threat for us. Not the statistics of risk, but the feelings of risk.\"\n\nMaking Choices\n\nAll those emotions can have real consequences.\n\nConsider the response to the partial meltdown of the nuclear plant at Three Mile Island, in Pennsylvania, in 1979. Though the incident caused no deaths, it led to public demand to turn from nuclear power to fossil fuels whose impact on air quality, alone, is thought to cause thousands of premature deaths every year.\n\nThat calculus confounded old-school economists, who saw it as irrational. One leading nuclear power expert called it \"insane.\"\n\nBut it also helped give rise to new psychological models for how people measure risk.\n\n\"Our feelings don't do arithmetic very well,\" Dr. Slovic said.\n\nThat can be especially true when judging low-probability, high-risk threats like nuclear war, terrorism -- or dying from the coronavirus or the flu.\n\nOur minds tend to either \"round down\" the probability to \"basically zero\" and we underreact, Dr. Slovic said. Or we focus on the worst-case outcome, he said, which \"gives us a strong feeling, so we overreact.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":
