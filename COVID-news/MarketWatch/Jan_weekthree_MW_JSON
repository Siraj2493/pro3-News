He said he expected at least 1,000 of some 3,000 suspected cases to be diagnosed with the highly-contagious virus.\n\n, said that the virus had an incubation period of 10 to 14 days, during which the virus can be contagious but the patients does not display symptoms. That would mark a major difference between the coronavirus and SARS.\n\n\"From observations, the virus is capable of transmission even during incubation period,\" Ma told a news conference, . \"Some patients have normal temperatures and there are many milder cases. There are hidden carriers.\"\n\nThe pneumonia-causing illness that infects the respiratory tract is now responsible for 82 deaths in China as of Sunday, up from 56 the day before, and more than 2,839 infections, up from 1,975 Saturday, health officials in China said.\n\nAlso see:\n\nIn an effort to ensure that people displaying symptoms come forward, Xiaowei said that the patients would not have to foot the bill of any medical costs.The virus is believed to have originated in Wuhan, likely at a food market; the youngest person to die of the illness was a nine-month-old baby girl.\n\nThere have also been three confirmed cases in the U.S., health officials in the U.S. said. The latest case, confirmed Saturday, was in Orange County; the person had recently visited Wuhan, and was in good condition. The gender and age of the person were not disclosed.\n\nThe first confirmed case in the U.S. was in the Seattle area; a man in his 30s who had also returned from a recent trip to Wuhan, was in good condition in a hospital in Everett, Wash. The second U.S. patient is a female Chicago resident in her 60s, who returned from a visit to Wuhan on Jan. 13.\n\nThe trade association of Chinese travel agencies also said that it would suspend overseas tour groups and flight/hotel vacation packages for Chinese citizens, effective Monday. The outbreak spread rapidly over the last seven days.\n\nRecommended:\n\nThe new virus has also infected people in Hong Kong, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, France, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Macao and Nepal. The U.S. State Department ordered the evacuation of all U.S. personnel at the Consulate in Wuhan.\n\nThe spread of the virus was likely helped by travel related to China's Lunar New Year holiday, which began Friday. This week, officials in Wuhan, a city with 11 million residents, closed the area's outgoing airport and railway stations, and suspended all public transport.\n\nChinese officials have since expanded that travel ban to 16 surrounding cities with a combined population of more than 50 million people, including Huanggang, a neighboring city to Wuhan with 7.5 million people, effectively putting those cities on lockdown.\n\nHong Kong's city leader Carrie Lam declared a state of emergency and said all primary and secondary schools would close until Feb. 17, two more weeks in addition to next week's Lunar New Year holiday, .\n\nThe city's marathon scheduled for Feb. 9, which typically attracts 70,000 participants, was also cancelled. Most of the cornavirus fatalities were older patients, although a 36-year-old man in Hubei died earlier this week, it added. Several major theme parks have also been shuttered.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "quentin_fottrell@marketwatch.com", "name":

illness has spread around the world so rapidly", "body": "A new study in the Lancet said this new strain is similar to SARS-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats\n\nThe number of coronavirus infections -- and fatalities -- has jumped in recent days. The mysterious pneumonia-causing illness that infects the respiratory tract was responsible for at least 41 deaths in Central China, , with 400 new cases identified by Chinese health officials. On Saturday, China also said that it would suspend overseas tour groups and flight/hotel vacation packages for Chinese citizens, effective Monday.\n\nThe outbreak has spread rapidly in over the last seven days. It is believed to have originated in Wuhan, likely at a food market. On Saturday, the U.S. State Department ordered the evacuation of all U.S. personnel at the Consulate in Wuhan. It infected people in Hong Kong, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, France, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Macao and Nepal. There have also been two confirmed cases in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nIn an effort to stem the spread of the virus from its suspected origin, transport bans were instituted in 16 cities with a combined population of 50 million people. Officials in Wuhan, a city with 11 million residents, said they had temporarily closed the area's outgoing airport and railway stations, and suspend all public transport. Long-distance trains and buses from Huanggang, a neighboring city with 7.5 million people, .\n\nThe spread was helped by China's Lunar New Year holiday, which began Friday. \"This is the wild card,\" . \"People unfamiliar with China have trouble understanding the immense travel phenomenon that occurs during Lunar New Year, when, over a one-month period, some 3 billion people are on the move, many returning to their home towns and regions but others vacationing. Peak travel occurs this week.\"\n\nThe virus has spread in China, helped by the country's Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nAnother reason for the rapid spread: While some people are canceling travel plans in China and opting to stay home over the holiday period, others may not yet have experienced the worst of the symptoms, believe themselves to be well enough to travel and/or could be reluctant to pay up to $400 to change a flight -- especially if they believe they merely have a common cold. In fact, previous iterations of the coronavirus are very similar to a common cold.\n\nPeople may not know they're carrying the virus, and doctors don't yet know how long it takes to develop. \"If you knew the incubation period, you could do quarantining of people who are in close contact with infected patients,\" Melissa Nolan, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina's Arnold School of Public Health, . \"You would monitor those people for the incubation period.\" Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, fever and a general feeling of being unwell, .\n\nPrevious iterations of the coronavirus are very similar to a common cold.\n\nBut more severe coronaviruses can become more serious and progress to pneumonia. \"Human coronaviruses can sometimes cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses, such as pneumonia or bronchitis,\" it added. \"This is more common in people with cardiopulmonary disease, people with weakened immune systems, infants, and older adults. Two other human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have been known to frequently cause severe symptoms.\"\n\nNasty bugs like coronaviruses can last for days on objects. The sinister sounding Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (more commonly known as MRSA) lasted longest (168 hours) on material from a seat-back pocket while the bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7 (also known as E.coli, which can cause kidney problems) survived longest (96 hours) on the material from the armrest of planes, according to research presented in 2014 to the American Society for Microbiology.\n\nIn an attempt to remain competitive, airlines have decreased their turnaround times in recent years. Many budget airlines have reduced turnaround times to 25 minutes by removing the seat pockets. have managed to have long-haul turnaround times of 90 minutes. Not only do planes get new plane load of passengers, they often get a completely different crew. Deep cleans are not always possible during such turnarounds, which could aid in the transmission of the coronavirus.\n\nOffice workers pick up 30% to 50% of the organisms that are left on surfaces.\n\nAfter flying, most people take public transport. You may avoid stainless steel poles on subways and buses, but do you touch turnstiles and ticket machines? They are arguably touched by even more people, says . Commuters are 6 times more likely to develop an acute respiratory infection if they traveled recently by bus or tram, a 2011 published in the BMC Journal of Infectious Diseases concluded.\n\nWhat can you do? Aisle seats will be touched most often by other people as they're trying to find their own, Gerba says. In 2008, members of a tour group experienced diarrhea and vomiting in an airplane flight from Boston to Los Angeles. Other passengers who suffered secondary infections were either sitting next to those infected -- or unsuspecting passengers seated in aisle seats, according to a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n\nWe may move away if we see someone sneeze at the water cooler or on a train, but touching objects is a faster way to transmit viruses, Gerba says. He recommends using hand sanitizers or disinfectant wipes, particularly at the office where people may be reluctant to stay home if they're sick. One 2014 study, presented at an American Society for Microbiology meeting in Washington, D.C.,\n\nA looking at five of six family members with the virus said the it's spreading from person to person, rather than exclusively from animals or infected food, and can be transmitted in social, family and even hospital environments. It also now being spread by people who have not been to Wuhan. \"This is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "quentin_fottrell@marketwatch.com", "name": "Quentin Fottrell",

Ezhou, a third city in the region with 1 million people, is also closing public transportation.\n\nThe pneumonia-causing virus has spread in China, helped by the country's Lunar New Year holiday, which begins Friday. \"This is the wild card,\" . \"People unfamiliar with China have trouble understanding the immense travel phenomenon that occurs during Lunar New Year, when, over a one-month period, some 3 billion people are on the move, many returning to their home towns and regions but others vacationing. Peak travel occurs this week.\"\n\nThe virus has spread in China, helped by the country's Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nAnother reason for the rapid spread: While some people are canceling travel plans in China and opting to stay home over the holiday period, others may not yet have experienced the worst of the symptoms, believe themselves to be well enough to travel and/or could be reluctant to pay up to $400 to change a flight -- especially if they believe they merely have a common cold. In fact, previous iterations of the coronavirus are very similar to a common cold.\n\nPeople may not know they're carrying the virus, and doctors don't yet know how long it takes to develop. \"If you knew the incubation period, you could do quarantining of people who are in close contact with infected patients,\" Melissa Nolan, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina's Arnold School of Public Health, . \"You would monitor those people for the incubation period.\" Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, fever and a general feeling of being unwell, .\n\nPrevious iterations of the coronavirus are very similar to a common cold.\n\nBut more severe coronaviruses can become more serious and progress to pneumonia. \"Human coronaviruses can sometimes cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses, such as pneumonia or bronchitis,\" it added. \"This is more common in people with cardiopulmonary disease, people with weakened immune systems, infants, and older adults. Two other human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have been known to frequently cause severe symptoms.\"\n\nNasty bugs like coronaviruses can last for days on objects. The sinister sounding Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (more commonly known as MRSA) lasted longest (168 hours) on material from a seat-back pocket while the bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7 (also known as E.coli, which can cause kidney problems) survived longest (96 hours) on the material from the armrest of planes, according to research presented in 2014 to the American Society for Microbiology.\n\nIn an attempt to remain competitive and profitable, airlines have increased their turnaround times in recent years. Many budget airlines, for example, have reduced turnaround times to 25 minutes by removing the seat pockets. have managed to have long-haul turnaround times of 90 minutes. Not only do planes get new plane load of passengers, they often get a completely different crew. Deep cleans are not always possible during such turnarounds, which could aid in the transmission of the coronavirus.\n\nOffice workers pick up 30% to 50% of the organisms that are left on surfaces.\n\nAfter flying, most people take public transport. You may avoid stainless steel poles on subways and buses, but do you touch turnstiles and ticket machines? They are arguably touched by even more people, says . Commuters are 6 times more likely to develop an acute respiratory infection if they traveled recently by bus or tram, a 2011 published in the BMC Journal of Infectious Diseases concluded.\n\nWhat can you do? Aisle seats will be touched most often by other people as they're trying to find their own, Gerba says. In 2008, members of a tour group experienced diarrhea and vomiting in an airplane flight from Boston to Los Angeles. Other passengers who suffered secondary infections were either sitting next to those infected -- or unsuspecting passengers seated in aisle seats, according to a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n\nWe may move away if we see someone sneeze at the water cooler or on a train, but touching objects is a faster way to transmit viruses, Gerba says. He recommends using hand sanitizers or disinfectant wipes, particularly at the office where people may be reluctant to stay home if they're sick. One 2014 study, presented at an American Society for Microbiology meeting in Washington, D.C.,\n\nIn the meantime, travelers to China should wear a surgical mask in crowded areas and avoid eating game meat. \"Avoid wet markets selling game meat and live poultry,\" David Hui, chairman of the department of medicine and therapeutics and director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, . \"More infections are expected in other provinces and cities and other countries during the Chinese New Year holiday.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com",

Eric Toner, M.D.\n\nScientist and scholar Eric Toner, quoted above in an excerpt from a Friday interview with the business-news channel CNBC, explained that China's efforts to contain the current outbreak of a fast-moving upper-respiratory illness are \"unlikely to be effective.\"\n\nThe comments come as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S.\n\nCases of the illness, which is related to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, have now turned up in a number of countries beyond China, where the illness originated in Wuhan City.\n\nThe number of infections has risen to 1,200, according to the Wall Street Journal. On top of that, the official death toll has risen to about 40, , from 26 yesterday. The Journal also reported that the outbreak was .\n\nBeijing has shut down parts of the Great Wall, as well as more than a dozen cities, restricting movement of some 46 million people, and canceling events related to the Lunar New Year, one of the busiest periods of travel and consumerism in the country.\n\n, citing people familiar, reported that the a charter flight was being arranged by the U.S. government to evacuate U.S. citizens and diplomats from Wuhan.\n\nthat leader Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has declared a virus emergency in the city of 7.3 million, extending school cancellations until Feb. 17 and barring visits to China.\n\nToner, an M.D. and researcher at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, , that posited such a disease within 18 months under the right circumstances.\n\nCoronaviruses, with SARS among that group, are infections of the respiratory tract that can lead to illnesses like pneumonia or the common cold.\n\nToner told that he hasn't completed research on the current strain of the Wuhan coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, but said that the death toll could run in the millions if the influenza were resistant to modern vaccines and was as easy to catch as the common flu.\n\nRead:\n\nTo be sure, an outbreak of SARS about 17 years ago claimed nearly 800 lives and infected more than 8,000 people worldwide. However, the death toll from that 2002-03 disease was nowhere near a million.\n\nTo put things into further perspective, the most virulent pandemic, the 1918 influenza, also known as the Spanish flu, killed .\n\nToner said that his coronavirus simulation \"was not [focused primarily on] the number of deaths; it was to point out that there could be societal and economic consequences from a severe pandemic, not just health consequences.\" The simulation was also geared toward , making the case that governments and private companies alone can't adequately respond to a pandemic.\n\nOne report estimates that a pandemic could cause an average annual economic loss of 0.7% of global GDP -- or $570 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization on Thursday wasn't sounding global alarm bells about the illness either, but falling short of calling the outbreak an international emergency. U.S. health officials also have said that the risk domestically from the illness is low.\n\nCheck out:\n\nHowever, the coronavirus was exacting a toll on the U.S. stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.58% was last down about 200 points, or 0.7%, at 28,962 but had been as low as 28,843 in Friday trading. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.90% was last down 34 points, or 1%, at 3,290. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.93% was off 97 points, or 1%, at 9,301, after touching a fresh intraday high in early action.\n\nToner said the WHO may have made a mistake by not declaring

face masks, a game called Plague, and an 'I Survived Coronavirus 2020' T-shirt", "body": "Demand is high for face masks and a plague-themed strategy game\n\nWelcome to the coronavirus marketplace.\n\nAmid rising infection cases and deaths from the new coronavirus, protective gear like face masks and at least one game related to disease outbreak have surged in sales. Meanwhile, some sellers have sought to capitalize on the growing alarm.\n\nCases of the new coronavirus were first detected in Wuhan, China and have since been reported in nearly a dozen countries, including the U.S. The virus has killed at least 26 people and infected more than 900, mostly in China, according to an data analysis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that a second U.S. case had been detected, this time in Chicago.\n\nFace masks are flying off shelves in China\n\nPatients with this strain of coronavirus have reported having a respiratory illness ranging in severity, with symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath, . While the federal agency said it doesn't yet know how easily this particular coronavirus spreads -- noting that some viruses are more contagious than others -- many patients in Wuhan had apparently had contact with a live animal and seafood market, and the infection later appeared to be spreading person-to-person among patients with no exposure to these markets.\n\n\"When person-to-person spread has occurred with MERS and SARS, it is thought to have happened via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread,\" the CDC . \"Spread of SARS and MERS between people has generally occurred between close contacts.\"\n\nAccordingly, face masks have flown off shelves, reportedly prompting factories to reopen ahead of China's Lunar New Year celebrations. Cao Jun, the general manager for Lanhine, a mask manufacturer in China, this week that a nationwide mask shortage was \"much, much more severe than what the public knows.\" All told, client demand has reached a cumulative 200 million masks a day, he said -- dwarfing Lanhine's typical daily output of 400,000.\n\n\"At the moment, we have 20-plus people in the factory, working 24 hours. We're offering them quadruple their wages per day,\" Cao told Reuters. \"We aim to ramp up output on Jan. 27 and be at full capacity on Feb. 1, when we'd have nearly 200 workers.\"\n\nAlibaba-owned BABA, -2.46% retailer Taobao sold some 80 million face masks on Monday and Tuesday, , and cautioned sellers against hiking up prices after reports of people flipping masks for profit.\n\nA spokesman for Honeywell HON, -1.36% , a leading manufacturer of protective face masks, told MarketWatch the company was experiencing \"a surge in demand\" in North America, Europe and China. He declined to disclose specific sales figures.\n\n\"We are increasing production at multiple facilities globally, and we are fulfilling all current orders,\" the spokesman said. \"In China, our products are available from JD.com and TMALL.com, and in the U.S. and Europe, they can be found at a number of retailers, including Amazon.\" AMZN, -1.22%\n\nMeanwhile, shares of companies that manufacture rubber gloves have jumped as the coronavirus spreads. Stock for the Malaysian manufacturer Top Glove rose nearly 14% over two days, the reported Wednesday, while Malaysian latex glove makers Supermax Corp. and Kossan Rubber Industries increased Wednesday by a respective 8% and 6%.\n\nOne eBay seller is hawking a 'coronavirus protection kit'\n\nA number of eBay EBAY, -0.70% sellers in recent days have also listed respirator masks, air purifiers and disposable fluid-resistant jackets, invoking \"coronavirus\" in their listing titles. A $21.99 which claims to offer \"full body protection,\" includes a 3M MMM, +0.23% mask, splash-resistant goggles, a disposable white coverall, medium and large pairs of nitrile gloves, antibacterial wipes, alcohol hand sanitizer and a clinical-waste biohazard bag.\n\nA virus-themed online game is gaining players\n\nConsumers haven't limited their virus-preparation measures to safety products. The strategy and simulation game Plague Inc., which has players \"bring about the end of human history by evolving a deadly, global plague\" as the world scrambles to defend itself, became China's best-selling app on Wednesday, according to the . The game sells on Apple's AAPL, -0.29% App Store for $0.99.\n\nIn its eight years of existence, Plague Inc. has typically seen a increase in players during disease outbreaks \"as people seek to find out more about how diseases spread and to understand the complexities of viral outbreaks,\" the game's U.K.-based developer, Ndemic Creations, said Friday posted to Twitter TWTR, -2.07%.\n\n\"We specifically designed the game to be realistic and informative, while not sensationalising serious real-world issues,\" the statement read. \"However, please remember that Plague Inc. is a game, not a scientific model and that the current coronavirus outbreak is a very real situation which is impacting a huge number of people.\" The developer directed players to the World Health Organization's resources on coronavirus.\n\nT-shirts in questionable taste and a timely Netflix series\n\nOf course, however scant, there is online merchandise -- including an \"I Survived Coronavirus 2020\" T-shirt ($16.49) on Etsy ETSY, +0.58% that's described as a possible \"instant favorite in every nurse's wardrobe\" and a \"Corona Virus\" shirt ($21.98) on Redbubble that's styled with the AB InBev-owned BUD, -0.66% Mexican lager brand's logo. (AB InBev did not respond immediately to a request for comment.) A Redbubble spokeswoman said the \"Corona Virus\" shirt was removed from the site. \"The Coronavirus-themed design in question is a violation of Redbubble's community guidelines regarding sensitivity around works that deal with catastrophic events,\" said spokeswoman Marissa Hermo. \"We have removed the design and will continue to monitor for any other artwork that similarly violates these guidelines.\"\n\nNetflix NFLX, +1.02% inadvertently got in on the viral marketing, debuting its six-part docuseries \"Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,\" which profiles health-care professionals and their efforts to battle virus outbreaks, this week. Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the release timing, but executive producer Sheri Fink addressed in a .\n\n\"At times like these, many people's thoughts turn to the existential threat to humanity posed by viruses,\" Fink said. \"But across the world each day, people work fiercely to protect us. Pandemic follows them.\"\n\n\"No, we didn't know there would be a scary outbreak on Pandemic's long-planned release date (please),\" she added. \"But this highlights the point: the risk never eases.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meera_jagannathan@marketwatch.com", "name": "Meera Jagannathan", "type": "author",

NVAX, +42.85%, which is developing two late-stage vaccines for the flu and other infectious diseases, gained 36%. NanoViricides Inc.

Some medical workers have also tested positive for the virus, the English-language China Daily newspaper reported.\n\nThe late-night announcement capped a day in which authorities announced a sharp uptick in the number of confirmed cases to more than 200, and China's leader called on the government to take every possible step to combat the outbreak.\n\nMarket Pulse (Jan. 17):\n\n\"The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan and other places must be taken seriously,\" President Xi Jinping said in his first public statement on the crisis. \"Party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people's lives and health first.\"\n\nXi's remarks were reported by state broadcaster CCTV on its main 7 p.m. evening news broadcast.\n\nIn Geneva, the World Health Organization announced it would convene an Emergency Committee meeting on Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak warrants being declared a global health crisis.\n\nSuch declarations are typically made for epidemics of severe diseases that threaten to cross borders and require an internationally coordinated response. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas in 2016 and the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014.\n\nThe spread of the viral pneumonia comes as the country enters its busiest travel period, when millions board trains and planes for the Lunar New Year holidays. The outbreak is believed to have started late last month when people picked it up at a fresh food market in Wuhan, a city in central China.\n\nWuhan health authorities said Monday an additional 136 cases have been confirmed in the city, raising the total to 198. Three have died.\n\nAuthorities elsewhere also announced cases in other Chinese cities for the first time.\n\nFive individuals in Beijing and 14 in Guangdong have also been diagnosed with the new coronavirus, CCTV reported Monday evening. A total of seven suspected cases have been found in other parts of the country, including in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in the southwest and in Shanghai.\n\nZhong said the two people in Guangdong had not been to Wuhan but fell ill after family members had returned from the city, the China Daily said.\n\nThe outbreak has put other countries on alert as millions of Chinese travel for Lunar New Year. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China.\n\nSouth Korea reported its first case Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul's Incheon airport. The woman has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, just west of Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.\n\nAt least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three U.S. airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.\n\nVideos posted online show people in protective suits checking one-by-one the temperatures of plane passengers arriving in Macao from Wuhan. A man surnamed Yang who works for the Macao Health Bureau confirmed over the phone that such checks are taking place in the southern Chinese region.\n\nCanada's Chief Medical officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said additional signage will be in place in the coming days at airports in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. There will also be additional screening questions at electronic kiosks at customs asking people if they have traveled to areas where coronavirus is and if they have flu like symptoms.\n\n\"The Chinese lunar year is coming so out of abundance precaution that's why we are putting out additional information for travelers,\" Tam said.\n\nMany of the initial cases of the coronavirus were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, which was closed as authorities investigated.\n\nSince hundreds of people who came into close contact with diagnosed patients have not gotten sick, the municipal health commission maintains that the virus is not easily transmitted between humans.\n\nChina's National Health Commission said experts have judged the current outbreak to be \"preventable and controllable.\"\n\n\"However, the source of the new type of coronavirus has not been found, we do not fully understand how the virus is transmitted, and changes in the virus still need to be closely monitored,\" the commission said in a statement Sunday.\n\nCoronaviruses cause diseases ranging from the common cold to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS first infected people in southern China in late 2002 and spread to more than two dozen countries, killing nearly 800. The Chinese government initially tried to conceal the severity of the SARS epidemic, but its cover-up was exposed by a high-ranking physician.\n\n\"In the early days of SARS, reports were delayed and covered up,\" said an editorial in the nationalistic Global Times. \"That kind of thing must not happen again in China.\"\n\n\"We have made great strides in medicine, social affairs management and public opinion since 2003,\" the editorial said.\n\nXi instructed government departments Monday to promptly release information on the virus and deepen international cooperation.\n\nChina has notified and maintained close communication with the World Health Organization and other relevant countries and regions, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular news briefing.\n\nWuhan has also adopted measures to control the flow of people leaving the city, Geng said.\n\nThe virus causing the current outbreak is different from those previously identified, Chinese scientists said earlier this month. Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath.\n\nOn the Weibo social media platform, which is widely used in China, people posted prevention advice such as wearing masks and washing hands. State broadcaster CCTV recommended staying warm, increasing physical activity, eating lightly and avoiding crowded places. Some people said they had canceled their travel plans and were staying home for Lunar New Year.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

"body": "BEIJING (AP) -- Asian stock markets tumbled Tuesday as concern about the economic impact of a Chinese disease outbreak rose.\n\nJapan's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged and revised up its economic growth outlook.\n\nMarket indexes in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney all retreated following the Chinese government's announcement of a fourth death from coronavirus. The outbreak, centered on the city of Wuhan, has sickened more than 200 people.\n\nAuthorities said some infections were transmitted person-to-person, increasing the risk the disease might spread faster during the Lunar New Year holiday, the Chinese-speaking world's busiest travel season. That prompted selling of shares in airlines, hotel operators and other travel-related companies.\n\nOther Asian governments stepped up screening of travelers from China, highlighting the potential impact on tourism revenue.\n\nThe outbreak \"is developing into a major potential economic risk to the Asia-Pacific region,\" said Rajiv Biswas of IHS Markit in a report.\n\nThe outbreak and measures to stop it have could affect tourism, retailing, restaurants, air travel and other industries, said Biswas. He pointed to the example of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, whose economic impact was felt as far away as Canada and Australia.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -1.41% fell 1% to 3,063.56 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index HSI, -2.77% was off 2.3% at 28,136.04. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.91% retreated 0.9% to 23,866.15.\n\nSeoul's Kospi 180721, -1.01% sank 0.8% to 2,245.29 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 XJO, -0.19% was off 0.3% at 7,055.40. India's Sensex 1, -0.33% opened down 0.3% at 41,400.48 Southeast Asian markets also declined.\n\nJapan's ANA Holdings Inc. fell 2.2%, while Hong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific dropped 4.8%. China Eastern Airlines lost 2.6%.\n\nThe Bank of Japan left its policy rate at -0.1% and reaffirmed its commitment to increase holdings of government bonds. Board members raised their projection of economic growth in the year that starts in April to 0.9% from 0.7%.\n\nThe European central bank also is due to make an interest rate decision this week.\n\nBenchmark U.S. oil fell 17 cents to $58.41 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 5 cents on Monday to close at $58.58. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 35 cents to $64.85 per barrel in London. It advanced 35 cents the previous session to $65.20.\n\nThe dollar declined to 109.98 yen from Monday's 110.18 yen.

On average, the economy created 14,500 jobs a month in 4Q 2019, down from 27,100 3Q 2019.\n\nThe story was compiled from Dow Jones Newswires and Associated Press reports.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI_300_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CSI 300 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wuhan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P/ASX_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ASX 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_&_Young", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ernst & Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 21}], "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HY645_corona_ZG_20200120054505.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 20}, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 20, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1419524031", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-22", "time": "15:34:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-22T15:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-22T15:33:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/vaccine-makers-tap-into-virus-driven-rally-to-raise-money-2020-01-22", "title": "Vaccine makers tap into virus-driven rally to raise money", "body": "Novavax Inc., which in 2013 developed a vaccine for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), filed to raise more than $100 million\n\nSome small vaccine developers that saw their stocks over growing concern about the new coronavirus are using the rally to raise money.\n\nNovavax Inc.

The vast majority of the infections and all the deaths have been in mainland China, but fresh cases are popping up.\n\nAustralia and Malaysia reported their first cases Saturday, and Japan, its third. France confirmed three cases Friday, the first in Europe, and the U.S. identified its second, a woman in Chicago who had returned from China.\n\nIn the heart of the outbreak, Wuhan, whose 11 million residents are already on lockdown, banned most vehicle use, including private cars, in downtown areas starting Sunday, state media reported. Only authorized vehicles carrying supplies and for other needs would be permitted, the reports said.\n\nThe city will assign 6,000 taxis to different neighborhoods, under the management of resident committees, to help people get around if they need to, China Daily said.\n\nIn Hong Kong, leader Carrie Lam said her government will raise its response level to emergency, the highest one, and close primary and secondary schools for two more weeks on top of next week's Lunar New Year holiday. They will reopen Feb. 17.\n\nLam said direct flights and trains from Wuhan would be blocked.\n\nIn a sign of the growing strain on Wuhan's health care system, the official Xinhua news agency reported that the city planned to build a second makeshift hospital with about 1,000 beds. The city previously announced construction of a hospital of the same size that was expected to be completed Feb. 3.\n\nThe new virus comes from a large family of what are known as coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath. It can worsen to pneumonia, which can be fatal.\n\nChina cut off trains, planes and other links to Wuhan on Wednesday, as well as public transportation within the city, and has steadily expanded a lockdown to 16 surrounding cities with a combined population of more than 50 million -- greater than that of New York, London, Paris and Moscow combined.\n\nChina's most festive holiday, Lunar New Year, unfolded Saturday in the shadow of the worrying new virus. Authorities canceled a host of Lunar New Year events, and closed major tourist destinations and movie theaters.\n\nTemples locked their doors, Beijing's Forbidden City and Shanghai Disneyland closed, and people canceled restaurant reservations ahead of the holiday, normally a time of family reunions, sightseeing trips and other festivities in the country of 1.4 billion people.\n\n\"We originally planned to go back to my wife's hometown and bought train tickets to depart this afternoon,\" said Li Mengbin, who was on a stroll by the moat of the closed Forbidden City. \"We ended up canceling. But I'm still happy to celebrate the new year in Beijing, which I hadn't for several years.\"\n\nTemples and parks were decorated with red streamers, paper lanterns and booths, but some places started dismantling the decor after the cancellations.\n\nPeople in China wore masks to restaurants and grocery stores, where workers dispensed hand sanitizer to customers. Some parts of the country had checkpoints for temperature readings and made masks mandatory.\n\nThe National Health Commission reported a jump in the number of infected people to 1,287. The latest tally, from 29 provinces and cities across China, included 237 patients in serious condition.\n\nOf the 41 deaths, 39 have been in Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital city, and one each in Hebei and Heilongjiang provinces. Most of the deaths have been older patients, though a 36-year-old man in Hubei died this week.\n\nElsewhere, the Australian state of Victoria announced its first case Saturday, a man in his 50s who returned from China last week. The state of New South Wales confirmed three more cases later in the day.\n\nMalaysia said three people tested positive Friday, all relatives of a father and son from Wuhan who had been diagnosed with the virus earlier in neighboring Singapore. It said a fourth case was a traveler from Wuhan who tested positive Saturday and was unrelated to the other cases.\n\nJapan confirmed a third case, a Chinese tourist in her 30s who had arrived from Wuhan on Jan 18.\n\nThe National Health Commission said it is bringing in medical teams to help handle the outbreak, a day after videos circulating online showed throngs of frantic people in masks lined up for examinations and complaints that family members had been turned away at hospitals that were at capacity.\n\nThe Chinese military dispatched 450 medical staff, some with experience in past outbreaks, including SARS and Ebola, who arrived in Wuhan late Friday to help treat many patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia, Xinhua reported.\n\nXinhua also said medical supplies are being rushed to the city, including 14,000 protective suits, 110,000 pairs of gloves and masks and goggles.\n\nThe rapid increase in reported deaths and illnesses does not necessarily mean the crisis is getting worse but could reflect better monitoring and reporting of the virus.\n\nIt is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which kills tens of thousands of people every year in the U.S. alone.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@marketwatch.com",

There are now 584 cases of the illness, a respiratory disease that has been compared to SARS and MERS, including 17 deaths, said the statement. Of those cases, 575 were reported in China, with other cases found in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, the U.S. and Vietnam. \"We are aware of media reports of suspected cases in other countries, but those cases are still being investigated,\" he said.

The ability of the virus to halt travel and harm consumption, particularly in Beijing, are some of the ways an outbreak could have economic implications that could wash up on U.S. shores.\n\nRead:\n\n\"Epidemics and pandemics do have market consequences and raise risk, and...they can be deadly,\" wrote David Kotok, chairman and CIO at money manager Cumberland Advisors, in a Wednesday research note.\n\n\"External shocks can derail economic trends and abruptly alter market sentiment.

About 12 months after that point, the broad-market benchmark was up 20.76% (see attached table):\n\nEpidemic Month end 6-month % change of S&P 12-month % change of S&P HIV/AIDS June 1981 -0.20 -10.73 Pneumonic plague September 1994 8.22 26.31 SARS April 2003 14.59 20.76 Avian flu June 2006 11.66 18.36 Dengue Fever September 2006 6.36 14.29 Swine flu April 2009 18.72 35.96 Cholera November 2010 13.95 5.63 MERS May 2013 10.74 17.96 Ebola March 2014 5.34 10.44 Measles/Rubeola December 2014 0.20 -0.73 Zika January 2016 12.03 17.45 Measles/Rubeola June 2019 9.82% N/A -- Source: Dow Jones Market Data\n\nSARS resulted in a total of about 8,100 people being sickened during the 2003 outbreak, with 774 people dying, .\n\nSeparately, the S&P 500 rose 11.66% in the roughly six months following reports of the 2006 Avian flu virus -- a fast-moving pathogen also known as H5N1. The market gained 18.36% in the following 12-month period.\n\nData are similar for equity performance across the globe based on data from Charles Schwab, tracking the MSCI All Countries World Index 892400, +0.10%. The index has gained an average 0.4% in the month after an epidemic, 3.1% in the ensuing six-month period and 8.5% a year later (see graphic below):\n\nThe severity of the virus, ultimately, will dictate the market's reaction and just because indexes have managed to shrug off the contagion from outbreaks in the past doesn't mean that will be the case this time.\n\nFor one, Coronavirus comes during the important Lunar New Year, when Asia tends to see peak travel and consumer spending.\n\n\"There are concerns that the coronavirus may spread quickly within and beyond China, causing economic and market damage. This is particularly a concern as travel ahead of the Lunar New Year is getting underway,\" wrote Jeffrey Kleintop, Charles Schwab's chief global investment strategist.\n\nOn top of that, markets may be vulnerable to swoons after busting to records.\n\n\"In a stock market where the dominant factor is price momentum, the impact of a change occurring in an external risk vector or a natural risk phenomenon is intensified,\" wrote Kotok.\n\nin an effort to contain the spread of the disease. Chinese officials , a city of 7.5 million people,while a smaller city Ezhou, with population of million, said it also would restrict travel, the Wall Street Journal reported. The lock downs follow reports earlier that officials in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, had instituted travel restrictions.\n\nMeanwhile, WHO said its emergency committee on Wednesday was split as to whether to declare the new coronavirus a and will meet again on Thursday \"given the rapidly evolving situation.\"\n\nA pandemic couldn't come at a worse time for China's sluggish economy, which slowed to 6.1% rate of annual growth last year, according to gross domestic product figures released last Friday, which reflected\n\n\"The upcoming Lunar New Year celebration...could accelerate the virus's spread as well as its economic impact,\" wrote analysts at Wells Fargo Securities, led by Jay Bryson, in a Wednesday report.\n\nAnd travel related stocks have taken a hit this week thus far.\n\nShares of Priceline.com parent Booking Holdings Inc.

And what it shows is an open road with just a few potholes.\n\nWe'll get a lot of rearview looks this week, including snapshots of consumer spending, business investment and gross domestic product at the end of 2019.\n\nWhat they are likely to show is a mixed bag -- just like the outlook for the economy in 2020.\n\nConsumer spending is still pretty healthy -- if not as strong as it was last spring and summer. The soaring stock market, easing trade tensions with China, a rebound in exports and a frothier housing market also point to steady if lackluster economic growth in the months ahead.\n\nRead:\n\nAnd:\n\nThe biggest drag on the economy has come from business investment and production. Business investment fizzled in 2018 and 2019, as the U.S. trade war with China intensified. Eventually manufacturers were forced to scale back as exports sagged.\n\nThose two contrasting forces are expected to produce a modest 2% increase in GDP in 2019. The report comes out Thursday.\n\nSee:\n\nThe freshly signed \"phase one\" trade deal with China should help unloosen some investment this year, economists say, but probably not a lot. The two countries are still at odds over a handful of very sensitive issues and are unlikely to make any major headway until after the 2020 U.S. election.\n\nThe election itself, what's more, is another wild card that could offer a stark choice between two diametrically opposed economic visions for the United States. Businesses might hunker down to see how the vote is shaping up before taking the plunge on major investments.\n\nSurveying the landscape, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to stand pat at its first big meeting of 2020. The central bank cut interest rates last year to shield the economy from the trade dispute with China, a strategy shift that reinvigorated a moribund housing market.\n\nRead:\n\nChairman Jerome Powell has been stressing that the Fed won't raise interest rates again until inflation meets and exceeds its 2% inflation target.\n\nThe Fed's preferred PCE inflation gauge, released Friday, might show an increase but probably not enough to lift the yearly rate any higher than 1.7%.\n\nWith inflation low and the economy forecast to slow to around 1.5% in 2020, many economists think a rate increase is a long, long way off.\n\n\"A cut is still more likely than a hike in the near term since growth shocks can materialize faster than a persistent shift in inflation,\" economists at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients.\n\nOne potential growth shock -- an unexpected event harmful to the economy -- is the outbreak of the coronavirus in China.\n\nChina has already quarantined millions of people to try to stop the spread of the disease, and if it harms the world's second largest economy, the damage will spread far beyond the country's borders. The U.S. is not immune, either.\n\n\"The economic impact of the Wuhan coronavirus is another unknown,\" chief economist Chris Low of FHN Financial said.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com",

"China quarantines Wuhan, city of 11 million people, to fight deadly coronavirus", "body": "BEIJING (AP) -- China closed off a city of more than 11 million people Thursday in an unprecedented effort to try to contain a deadly new viral illness that has sickened hundreds and spread to other cities and countries in the Lunar New Year travel rush.\n\nNormally bustling streets, shopping malls, restaurants and other public spaces in Wuhan were eerily quiet. Social media users posted that movie theaters were canceling showings and complained that food vendors were exploiting the situation with huge price increases on fresh produce.\n\nPolice, SWAT teams and paramilitary troops guarded the city's train station, where metal barriers blocked the entrances at 10 a.m. sharp. Only travelers holding tickets for the last trains were allowed to enter, with those booked for later trains being turned away. Virtually everyone at the scene was wearing masks, news website The Paper's live broadcast showed.\n\n\"To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,\" Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization's representative in China, told The Associated Press in an interview at the WHO's Beijing office. \"It has not been tried before as a public health measure. We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.\"\n\nLocal authorities have demanded all residents wear masks in public places and urged government staff to wear them at work and for shopkeepers to post signs for their visitors, Xinhua news agency quoted a government notice as saying.\n\nRead:\n\nTrain stations, the airport, subways, ferries and long-distance shuttle buses were stopped in the city, an industrial and transportation hub in central China's Hubei province. Xinhua cited the city's anti-virus task force as saying the measures were taken in an attempt to \"effectively cut off the virus spread, resolutely curb the outbreak and guarantee the people's health and safety.\"\n\nCake Liu left Wuhan last Friday after visiting her boyfriend there. She said everything was normal then, before human-to-human transmission of the virus was confirmed. But things have changed rapidly.\n\n\"(My boyfriend) didn't sleep much yesterday. He disinfected his house and stocked up on instant noodles,\" Liu said. \"He's not really going out. If he does he wears a mask.\"\n\nThe illnesses from a newly identified coronavirus first appeared last month in Wuhan, and the vast majority of mainland China's 571 cases have been in the city. Other cases have been reported in the Thailand, the United States, Japan and South Korea. One case was confirmed Thursday in Hong Kong after one was earlier confirmed in Macao. Most cases outside China were people from Wuhan or who had recently traveled there.\n\nA total of 17 people have died, all of them in and around Wuhan. Their average age was 73, with the oldest 89 and the youngest 48.\n\nThe significant increase in illnesses reported just this week come as millions of Chinese travel for the Lunar New Year, one of the world's largest annual migrations of people. Analysts have predicted the reported cases will continue to multiply.\n\n\"Even if (the number of cases) are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,\" Galea said, adding, however, that the number of cases is not an indicator of the outbreak's severity, so long as the mortality rate remains low.\n\nThe coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-2003 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, which developed from camels.\n\nChina is keen to avoid repeating mistakes with its handling of SARS. For months, even after the illness had spread around the world, China parked patients in hotels and drove them around in ambulances to conceal the true number of cases and avoid WHO experts.\n\nIn the current outbreak, China has been credited with sharing information rapidly, and President Xi Jinping has emphasized that as a priority.\n\n\"Party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels must put people's lives and health first,\" he said Monday. \"It is necessary to release epidemic information in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation.\"\n\nThe first cases in the Wuhan outbreak were connected to people who worked at or visited a seafood market, which has since been closed for an investigation. Experts suspect the virus was first transmitted from wild animals but the virus also may be mutating. Mutations can make it deadlier or more contagious.\n\nWHO plans another meeting of scientific experts Thursday on whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency, which it defines as an \"extraordinary event\" that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.\n\nMany countries are screening travelers from China for illness, especially those arriving from Wuhan. North Korea has banned foreign tourists, a step it also took during the SARS outbreak and in recent years due to Ebola. Most foreigners going to North Korea are Chinese or travel there through neighboring China.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

and gets deadlier, shares of health care companies that announce plans to take part in finding a vaccine, or identifying patients with the new strain, have rallied sharply in very active trading.\n\nOn Thursday, among the bigger coronavirus gainers was Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s stock INO, +10.42% , which ran up 12% to the highest close since May 9. Trading volume swelled to 12.3 million shares, compared with the full-day average over the past 30 days of about 1.4 million shares, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Pennsylvania-based biotechnology company said early Thursday that it was awarded a grant of up to $9 million by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to develop a vaccine for the new strain of coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, which originated in Wuhan, China, and has killed no less than 17 people.\n\nDon't miss: .\n\nThe grant builds on Inovio's existing partnership with CEPI, in which the company was granted in to develop vaccines for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Lassa fever.\n\nThe latest grant was aimed at funding development of Inovio's new vaccine matched to 2019-nCoV, INO-4800, through phase 1 human testing.\n\nInovio and its partners was able to advance its vaccine for Zika virus \"from bench to human testing\" in seven months, which Inovio said it believed to be the fastest vaccine development on record in recent decades.\n\n\"We have challenged ourselves to do this one even faster,\" said Joseph Kim, in a phone interview with MarketWatch.\n\nKim said after the DNA sequence of the new coronavirus strain was made publicly available on Jan. 11, Inovio was able to design and construct a potential vaccine in \"a matter of hours,\" and the animal-testing process has already begun.\n\nKim said he's targeting the first human tests to begin in the U.S. \"before early summer.\" And while it could typically take years to get a vaccine through all three phases of human testing, \"in a potential outbreak setting, there could be a lot of shortcuts,\" Kim said.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee, which was convened to give advice on whether the 2019-nCoV outbreak should be deemed a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), said that it \",\" but added that the committee should reconvene in a \"matter of days.\"\n\nAnalyst Jason McCarthy at Maxim Group reiterated his buy rating on Inovio and his price target for the stock of $6.00, which is 55% above current levels. In a note to clients titled, \"New coronavirus; who do you call? Inovio,\" McCarthy said the previously developed vaccine candidates for MERS and Zika was a key reason why CEPI picked Inovio for 2019-nCoV.\n\nOutside of the coronavirus programs, Inovio has one treatment for brain cancer in phase 3 trials and two immuno-oncology therapies in phase 2 trials.\n\nInovio's stock has run up 67% over the past three months but was still down 23% over the past 12 months. In comparison, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology exchange-traded fund IBB, -2.19% has advanced 13% the past three months, the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF has advanced 13% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.90% has gained 10%.\n\n\"We believe the [healthcare] sector will continue to perform well driven by increased demand for drugs, diagnostic testing equipment and hospital services,\" wrote J.P. Morgan analysts in a research note.\n\nInovio said its collaborators in the development of the new coronavirus vaccine include the Wistar Institute, VGXI, a fully owned subsidiary of GeneOne Life Science Inc. 011000, +1.75% and Twist Bioscience Corp. Twist's stock TWST, -0.69% fell 4.9% on Thursday, and has slipped 4.1% this week.\n\nIn addition to CEPI's existing partnerships with Inovio and the University of Queensland in Australia, CEPI also announced new partnerships with Moderna Inc. and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nModerna's stock closed down 2.3%, , but has still gained 4.1% this week.\n\nThe company said earlier that it has collaborated with the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to develop a 2019-nCoV vaccine. CEPI will fund the manufacture of the vaccine.\n\nCo-Diagnostics's stock nearly doubles on massive volume\n\nAnother coronavirus screamer Thursday was Co-Diagnostics Inc.'s stock CODX, -7.39% , which nearly doubled (up 80%) to a one-year high. Trading volume shot up to 36.1 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 161,000 shares.\n\nThe company said before the opening bell that it has \"completed principle design work\" for a test to screen for 2019-nCoV.\n\nChief Executive Dwight Egan said in a statement that if the World Health Organization declares the illness a global health emergency, he believes Co-Diagnostics would be in position to \"quickly assist\" in providing its test to the affected countries.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmong other coronavirus high-fliers, shares of NanoViricides Inc. NNVC, +54.48% , which makes nano-medicines for viral diseases, bounced 43% in active trading, after tumbling 55% on Tuesday. The seesawing comes after the stock rocketed 153% on Monday.\n\nAlso read: .\n\nShares of Novavax Inc. NVAX, +1.83% , which developed a vaccine for MERS in 2013, hiked up 8.0% on Thursday, and has climbed 33% this week.\n\nCerus Corp.'s stock CERS, +2.01% gained 4.2% after the company pointed to a recent study published in \"Transfusion Medicine\" regarding the inactivation of the SARS coronavirus in human platelets using Cerus's Intercept Blood Systems for platelets.

That was the highest most-active contract settlement since Jan. 7, according to FactSet data.\n\n\"Appetite towards the precious metal should remain supported by growing fears over the coronavirus outbreak in China,\" said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM. \"The general uncertainty is likely to accelerate the flight to safety with gold seen testing $1568 in the short term,\" but if $1,555 proves to be an unreliable support level, prices could slip back towards $1,545, he said.\n\nThe fast-moving influenza has now spread from China to Singapore during Lunar New Year, a key travel and gold-buying period in the Asian region.

now favors commodity sector over techs", "body": "Growth stocks hammered value plays last year, as they have been doing since the U.S. recession ended. According to Citi, the MSCI all-cap world value index has underperformed the MSCI growth index by 25% since 2010, with 2019 showing the biggest gap in performance in 20 years.\n\nBut there was one value strategy that actually performed reasonably well last year. Buying the cheapest four global sectors by the yield for free cash flow (FCF) -- which is operating cash flow minus capital expenditure -- generated an 8% return in 2019, and that positive return has a lot to do with the screen pointing to highflying tech stocks.\n\nThat is no longer the case. The FCF yield strategy now is positive on commodity stocks, particularly in the energy sector, which is flashing the first overweight since 2007, according to Citi. And it is underweight IT for the first time since 2006. \"Last year's 45% share price appreciation against a 3% fall in FCF means that global IT has finally started to look expensive relative to other sectors,\" the strategists at Citi said in the call of the day.\n\nEnergy and mining stocks are quite naturally capital intensive as it is expensive to extract oil or minerals out of the ground. But they have been so out of favor with investors that free cash flow yield is an impressive 6.7% for mining stocks and 5.7% for energy companies, according to Citi.\n\nMega stocks in the U.S. with a high FCF yield include AbbVie ABBV, -0.89%, Gilead GILD, +1.28% and Biogen BIIB, +0.32% in the health-care sector, IBM IBM, +3.39%, Broadcom AVGO, +1.56% and Oracle ORCL, -0.91% in IT, and AT&T T, +1.35%, Comcast CMCSA, +0.30% and Verizon Communications VZ, +0.27% in communication services.\n\nEnergy and materials firms outside the U.S. with a high FCF yield include miners BHP Group BHP, +1.37% and Rio Tinto RIO, +0.92%, and in the energy space Suncor Energy SU, -0.75%, Total TOT, -0.47%, BP BP, -1.15% and Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A, -0.03%, according to Citi.\n\nAs for the market overall, the FCF yield screen finds global equities are still decent value, with a 4% yield, which is in line with median 3.9% over the last 15 years.\n\nThe buzz\n\nChinese authorities closed public transportation in the 11 million-person city of Wuhan, which is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, and also set plans to shut off nearby Huanggang.\n\nEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said there are signs of a moderate increase in underlying inflation as the central bank kept interest rates unchanged. In the U.S., jobless claims rose to 211,000 in mid-January.\n\nThe earnings calendar includes 18 S&P 500 components, with Comcast CMCSA, +0.30% rising after results, while Procter & Gamble PG, +0.18% and Travelers TRV, +0.31% fell. After the close, microchip maker Intel INTC, +3.60% reports results.\n\nThe markets\n\nAsian stocks were battered on Thursday, with the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -2.75% tumbling 2.75%, the Hang Seng HSI, -1.52% losing 1.5% and the Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.98% dropping 1%.\n\nU.S. stock futures ES00, -0.24% YM00, -0.35% fell mildly, a day after a virtually flat performance for the S&P 500.\n\nCrude-oil futures CL.1, -2.98% fell, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.92% fell 3 basis points.\n\nThe chart\n\nFor all of the talkthat is, that a standard portfolio should have 60% in equities and 40% in bonds -- it turns out that investors come pretty close to upholding it. Analysts at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale find that the weight of risky assets, which they define as both equities and credit, rarely gets above 64%. What's notable is that investor portfolios are priced near the peak of their riskiness, despite $372 billion in net outflows from equity funds and $505 billion of net inflows into bonds and cash since January 2018.\n\nRandom reads\n\nZion Williamson made his professional basketball debut .\n\nA rover on Mars .\n\nEverything you think you know is wrong -- 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit .\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but to get it delivered once to your email box.
