No one really knows, but medical experts at Johns Hopkins are downplaying the threat from 2019-nCoV, the name for the type of coronavirus grabbing headlines.\n\n\"The immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general public in the United States is thought to be low at this time,\" says Gabor Kelen, a medical doctor and director of the Johns Hopkins Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response.\n\nEven if coronavirus turns out to be as contagious and deadly as really bad contagious diseases like Ebola, it will most likely be successfully curbed. The Ebola outbreak a few years ago was effectively kept in check, and so were the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003-04, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak early last decade.\n\n\"All three outbreaks were contained before they could have a significant impact on the global economy or financial markets around the world,\" says Ed Yardeni, of Yardeni Research. \"We expect the same outcome with the current outbreak.\"\n\nThe good news is that health officials learned a lot about containing virus outbreaks from those three experiences.\n\n\"Health technology has advanced considerably,\" says Andrew Tilton, the chief Asia economist at Goldman Sachs. \"Chinese authorities have already sequenced the virus and shared it with the global health community, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control have just developed a test for the virus.\"\n\nAnother positive is that public awareness seems to be much higher, because of the more rapid official response in China and the internet and social media, says Tilton. Local authorities in China reported SARS quickly in early January 2003. But up the chain of command, officials dragged their feet. The first official press conference on SARS did not happen until Feb. 11.\n\nRead:\n\n2. The lockdown affects a small part of China\n\nBut what about the lockdown? Even if coronavirus is contained, won't the lockdown have a big impact on China's economy? Probably not, at least as things stand now. , in Hubei province, where coronavirus originated. So far, the lockdown affects only around 60 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion.\n\nLikewise, Hubei province only produces about 4.7% of China's overall GDP, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\n\nRead:\n\n3. The breakout happened at an opportune time\n\nChina's economy was about to wind down anyway for the Chinese New Year celebration when the outbreak occured. So productivity was already scheduled to take a seasonal dip.\n\nTo the extent that the virus in China creates domestic fear and unrest, or hurts the economy, it weakens China's Premier Xi Jinping's hand in tariff negotiations with the U.S. This suggests and easier path toward progress, which would be a positive for business confidence and the U.S. stock market.\n\nOf course, the bad news here is that a lot more people in China have travel plans around the New Year. This could make the virus spread more quickly.\n\n4. The public typically tends to overreact to health threats\n\nWhenever there's a new virus outbreak, people are egged on by the media echo chamber, which latches on to the story and repeats it ad nauseum, drilling fear and concern into the minds of investors and the general public alike. The same thing happens on social media, where rumors can spread unchecked.\n\nThis amplifies the perception of risk, but not the risk itself. At some point and perhaps soon, the media and Twitter will move on to the next story of the day, and coronavirus fears will ease.\n\nThe echo chamber impact was compounded by the following problem: Investor sentiment was extremely high going into this (both the Dow and the S&P set the latest in a string of records on Jan. 17), which made the market more vulnerable to \"bad news\" and negative headlines. Overconfident investors are convinced that nothing can go wrong. So when something negative crops up, they're surprised and they feel betrayed, which escalates their selling.\n\nPart of the exaggerated reaction to coronavirus is linked to the fact that it is new, and emanating from a foreign country. The fears about it seem irrational, if you consider the following contrasts. So far, coronavirus has claimed fewer than 100 lives. SARS, which also sparked widespread panic and investor selling, claimed hundreds of lives, and fewer than 10,000 cases were reported.\n\nIn contrast, other flu viruses in circulation in the U.S. last year took over 34,000 lives, and they are taking a similar toll this year. Yet unlike coronavirus and SARS, these flu viruses have had zero impact on the stock market. This suggests the current hysteria developing about coronavirus is irrational.\n\nRead:\n\n5. Any economic impact will be short lived\n\nCoronavirus fears could hit travel globally, and produce a decline in consumer spending in Asia and the U.S. But the effect tends to wear off pretty fast. \"These retrenchments in spending are short-lived as consumers eventually get frugal fatigue,\" says Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nOne fear is that there could be enough of a pullback in consumer spending and travel to hit economic growth. But again, the effect will probably be limited. \"The negative impact on growth and asset prices from viral outbreaks typically normalizes within a few months,\" says Tilton at Goldman Sachs.\n\n\"The outbreak of the coronavirus could drive large swings in Mainland China and emerging Asia growth in the first half but a much smaller impact on full-year growth, if the SARS episode is any guide,\" says JP Morgan economist Bruce Kasman.\n\nSeveral recent developments will continue support the economy and the stock market, says Baird chief investment strategist Bruce Bittles. He cites recent progress on U.S.-China trade talks, an accommodative Federal Reserve, low interest rates, and muted inflation. \"We don't expect these factors supporting investor confidence and consumer spending to change anytime soon,\" he says.\n\nRead:\n\nWhat stocks to buy\n\nAll of this suggest stocks hit particularly hard because they have exposure to China look like buys here.\n\nTake Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, -7.59%, for example.\n\n\"If history is any guide, the weakness in Royal's stock could present a compelling buying opportunity as consumers have been fairly quick to shrug off illness outbreaks in recent years,\" says William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia. The cruise industry actually did better after the SARS outbreak and \"more recent outbreaks such as Zika or Ebola have had no discernible impact on cruise demand,\" she says.\n\nAlso consider U.S. companies getting hit hard in the past few days because of China exposure. They include: Starbucks SBUX, -3.59%, Walt Disney DIS, -2.98%, Nike NKE, -1.75%, Est\u00e9e Lauder EL, -4.07%, Wynn Resorts WYNN, -8.06%, Las Vegas Sands LVS, -6.75%, Marriott International MAR, -2.14%, Hyatt Hotels H, -0.70%, Yum China Holdings YUMC, -5.27%, IMAX IMAX, -4.23%, PVH PVH, -3.72%, Tapestry TPR, -3.85%, and GreenTree Hospitality Group GHG, -2.20%\n\nRead:\n\nOf course, if there's a massive coronavirus outbreak in China, all bets are off, but that's not my base case. To track the progress, .\n\nNow read:\n\nAt the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

are overblown.\n\nSo Monday's biggest one-day percentage declines since early October in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.09% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.77% on coronavirus fears have

Trump declares coronavirus a public-health emergency, U.S. citizens returning from Hubei Province to be quarantined", "body": "The State Department on Friday told Americans not to travel to China\n\nPresident Donald Trump's coronavirus task force on Friday announced a series of actions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus outbreaks, including declaring a public-health emergency in the U.S.\n\nThe task force also said that starting Feb. 2, all returning U.S. citizens who traveled to Hubei Province, China, over the last 14 days will undergo . Wuhan City, reportedly the epicenter of the viral outbreak, is in that Chinese province.\n\nThe task force also said that the U.S. will no longer allow foreign nationals who have traveled in China over the past 14 days and \"pose a risk\" at spreading the virus into the U.S., according to remarks made by Alex Azar, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Immediate family members of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have traveled to the area, will face the quarantines.\n\nWatch the task force news conference here:\n\nEarlier Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the 195 U.S. citizens who were repatriated from Wuhan earlier this week have now been placed in federal quarantine over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe latest figures from China's National Health Commission say that and about 9,700 have been sickened. The number of people who died rose by 43 overnight.\n\nIt is the first time that the CDC has issued a quarantine in 50 years, according to comments made by Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The patients are at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, Calif. Health officials said one individual tried to leave but remains on the base.\n\nAccording to figures provided by the World Health Organization on Thursday, there are 98 confirmed cases in 18 countries, including eight person-to-person transmissions in Germany, Japan, Vietnam, and the U.S. The CDC said Friday that there are 241 people under investigation, 114 of which have tested negative for the coronavirus.\n\nSeveral countries including Singapore and the U.S. are implementing stronger travel recommendations and border closures in light of the WHO's declaration of a public-health emergency of international concern and a surge in coronavirus cases world-wide.\n\nThe State Department on Friday told Americans not to travel to China, in a Level 4 warning, which is its highest level. Singapore said that starting Feb. 1, no visitors who have traveled to mainland China within the last 14 days will be allowed to enter the country or travel through it. Mongolia and Russia have borders, and Pakistan to and from mainland China.\n\nStarting on Feb. 2, incoming U.S.-bound flights from China will be directed to seven airports: John F. Kennedy International, Chicago's O'Hare International, San Francisco International, Seattle-Tacoma International, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Los Angeles International, and Honolulu's Official Daniel K. Inouye International airports\n\n\"We worry that the market underappreciates the duration of this crisis in China,\" Raymond James' Chris Meekins, a former official for the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote in a Jan. 30 note. \"We believe the travel advisories are likely to continue for the next few months.\"\n\nSome cash-hungry biotechs are tapping the crisis to raise money: At least a dozen small companies have disclosed plans to pursue development of vaccines, diagnostics and antiviral therapeutics that may be used to prevent or treat the coronavirus. At least half a dozen companies have announced plans to start coronavirust-related development over the last two weeks, including Co-Diagnostics Inc. CODX, +20.74%, Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. INO, -2.79%, NanoViricides Inc. NNVC, +39.67%, and Moderna. Inc. MRNA, -2.29%\n\nMRNA, -2.29%\n\nHowever, Brad Loncar, CEO of Loncar Investments, cautions against reading too much into these rallies. \"Small companies are cash-hungry and struggling to survive,\" he said, \"and the sad reality is if you can get a pop in your stock price, you might be able to raise money.\" Investors should look for two things: a record in following through on past development claims, and credible science as confirmed by government partners both in the U.S. and elsewhere. He cites Newlink Genetics Corp. NLNK, +0.61% as an example. Newlink has worked with Merck Inc. MRK, -1.23% since 2014 on an Ebola vaccine, which wasn't approved by the Food and Drug Administration until December 2019.\n\nAirlines are under pressure: The American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -3.17% on Friday announced it was suspending flights to mainland China. The news came after American Airlines pilots on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the airline, seeking to halt flights between the U.S. and China, over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. A number of airlines including British Airways PLC and Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, -2.38% have halted flights between the U.S. and China. Others including United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, -3.79% have suspended some flights.\n\nCorporations with exposure in China weigh impact on revenue, supply chain: The Coca-Cola Co. KO, -0.78% CEO James Quincey told investors during a Jan. 30 earnings call that the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and 2004 was less of a concern than this coronavirus. The Chinese market makes up 10% of Coca-Cola's global volume. \"China's economy was in a different place when SARS happened,\" he said. \"It's worth noting that China's economy is much bigger and this could become more connected to the rest of the world.\" Levi Strauss & Co.'s LEVI, -0.56% plans to push growth in China in 2020 were slowed in January by the outbreak, according to president and CEO Charles Victor Bergh. How the outbreak will impact global supply chains is also a concern for Honeywell International Inc. HON, -2.87%, Johnson Controls International PLC JCI, -2.62%, and ResMed Inc. RMD, -3.91%, according to FactSet transcripts of comments made by their executives during earnings calls. \"There could be some supply chain disruptions,\" Johnson Controls CEO George Oliver told investors.\n\nRead more about the coronavirus outbreak:", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jaimy_lee@marketwatch.com", "name":

spread of coronavirus", "body": "As conspiracy theories spread, Facebook has said it will remove potentially dangerous information, like false claims that drinking bleach cures coronavirus\n\nAs public health authorities work to halt the spread of coronavirus in the U.S., they'll face two major obstacles: eroding trust in the media and medical system, and fake news.\n\nAs of Monday morning, , and at least 361 had died, according to Chinese health authorities. The coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, located in the Hubei province.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Thursday of the coronavirus in the U.S. after the husband of a woman who was the first confirmed case in Illinois came down with the sickness. The CDC said Friday that 241 people in the U.S. were being examined to see whether they had contracted the illness, and that there are now 11 confirmed cases across the country.\n\n'The social media platforms are really going to be in a position to potentially shape whether coronavirus outbreaks can happen here.' -- Matt Jacob, a public health consultant\n\nIn the era of fake news, when false information spreads at lightning speed across social media platforms and , public health officials in the U.S. could face significant challenges keeping Americans safe if the illness were to begin spreading more rapidly.\n\n\"Whenever a threat like a potentially global infectious disease appears in the media, members of the public try to make sense of the nature of the threat,\" said Adrian Bangerter, a professor at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland. \"If trust is low, then there is a risk that alternative explanations like conspiracy theories may complicate efforts to contain disease spread.\"\n\nAlready, debunked conspiracy theories and rumors have spread regarding the coronavirus, including on sites like Reddit and Weibo. Malaysia arrested five people about the illness online.\n\nFacebook's head of health said in a blog post Thursday that , including posts about false cures such as drinking bleach to cure coronavirus. Hashtags that are being used to spread disinformation on Instagram will be blocked or restricted.\n\n(The CDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately return requests for comment.)\n\nAmericans' trust in government, the media and medicine has eroded\n\nAmericans have less confidence in some of our most hallowed institutions. Trust in the presidency, Congress, newspapers and television news have declined over the past couple of decades, shows. That trend doesn't bode well for public health officials trying to communicate vital information about a disease outbreak.\n\nDuring an outbreak, \"the best sources of information are going to be government public health officials,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. \"The less they heed those authorities, the less likely they are to take the advice.\"\n\nWhat's worse, people's trust in health care providers has also slipped. Just 36% of people in the U.S. had a \"great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in the medical system as of 2019, the lowest level since 2014 and far lower than back in 1975 when that figure stood at 80%, according to Gallup.\n\n'The best sources of information are going to be government public health officials...the less they heed those authorities, the less likely they are to take the advice.' -- Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security\n\nshowed a strong correlation between a person's trust in their doctors or nurses and their trust in vaccinations.\n\n\"The health system in this country is not beloved,\" said Matt Jacob, a public health consultant based in Washington, D.C. \"But most Americans have a fairly limited knowledge of science and medicine, and that creates a challenge.\"\n\nOne bright spot: a suggests that Americans view the CDC more favorably than other government agencies, even though trust in the government is at record lows.\n\nMisinformation spreads like wildfire when people are afraid\n\nThere are dangerous side effects to false information. When the rumor mill begins, public health officials are pulled away from work they could be doing to contain an outbreak in order to correct the record.\n\n\"During the Ebola outbreak in 2014, we saw a lot of misplaced fear in the U.S. that caused major disruptions,\" Adalja said. \"That makes it much more difficult because public health experts spend more time dispelling rumors than dealing with the problem at hand.\"\n\nSocial media facilitates the rapid spread of fake news, conspiracy theories and rumors, which makes it harder for public health officials to do their jobs. A found that false news stories were 70% more likely to be reposted on Twitter TWTR, +2.71% than true ones.\n\n\"The social media platforms are really going to be in a position to potentially shape whether coronavirus outbreaks can happen here,\" Jacob said. Facebook FB, +2.06% and Twitter both took steps to prioritize content from trusted news sources following the measles outbreak nationwide last year, he noted. Health officials said a social-media misinformation campaign led by the anti-vaccination movement\n\nIn response to the coronavirus outbreak, Facebook has brought on third parties to fact-check content on the social media platform, including the Associated Press and AFP.\n\n\"Several of our third-party fact-checking partners around the world have rated content false so we are dramatically reducing its distribution and people who see this content, try to share it, or already have, are alerted that it's false,\" a Facebook spokeswoman said. \"This situation is fast-evolving and we will continue our outreach to global and regional health organizations to provide support and assistance.\" (Twitter did not immediately return requests for comment.)\n\nReddit, meanwhile, does not include a specific ban on misinformation , but the site has added a banner to its homepage that with expert information on coronavirus. Additionally, the volunteer moderators on the platform's many subsections can set their own rules for what type of posts are allowed. The prohibits sensationalized headlines and requires reliable sources. The subreddit also flags posts that appear to contain rumors or information not yet confirmed by official sources.\n\nHow public health agencies could better use social media\n\nThe rise of the anti-vaccination movement has helped prepare public health professionals to contend with fake news, experts said.\n\n\"I believe they are utilizing social media better than ever to provide frequent updates and to address fears,\" said Lisa Gualtieri, an assistant professor of public health at Tufts University. \"Trends like the anti-vaccination movement were a wake-up call that fears need to be addressed, not ignored.\"\n\nNimbleness will be key in addressing misinformation online and ensuring that people have accurate, actionable information during an illness outbreak.\n\n'Trends like the anti-vaccination movement were a wake-up call that fears need to be addressed, not ignored.' -- Lisa Gualtieri, assistant professor of public health at Tufts University\n\nSome have even suggested that public health officials could benefit from to ensure that their message reaches a large audience quickly. \"State and federal health agencies need to rely heavily on allies and partners who can

It took 3.2 months to get a Zika vaccine into trials, he added.\n\nModerna Inc. MRNA-8.09% a biotechnology company developing messenger RNA treatments and vaccines, said Jan. 23 that it is working with NIAID to design a vaccine.

(This is a much shorter period than the typical development timeline for a new drug. The Food and Drug Administration estimates that it takes an average of 12 years to bring a new drug to market.)\n\nPublic concern about the coronavirus has shifted sharply in the 10 days since the U.S. identified its first diagnosed case. China's National Health Commission said Tuesday that there are now 9,239 suspected cases, 5,974 confirmed cases and 132 deaths. About 100 people have been \"cured\" and discharged in the 31 Chinese provinces that have reported cases of the coronavirus. There are five confirmed cases in the U.S., and 165 people are under investigation.\n\n\"The next four weeks to five weeks are going to be critical,\" Fauci said during the JAMA interview. \"It's either going to start peaking and going on a downturn, or it's going to explode into a global outbreak.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization's Emergency Committee said it would meet again on Thursday to discuss whether the outbreak is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\n\nWhy isn't there a vaccine already?\n\nResearchers developed a vaccine for SARS that was eventually tested in a Phase I trial in 10 healthy adults. However, by the time it had gone through an early-stage trial, the severity of the outbreak had declined, and it was no longer of use.\n\n\"There's been some really good work on SARS and MERS that is educating this process,\" said Andrew Pekosz, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"You assume that everything that works for SARS and MERS will work for this virus, therefore you just plug in the very specific pieces of the new coronavirus into these vaccine platforms [and] you should be able to get vaccine candidates very quickly.\"\n\nToday's development pace is also much quicker. It took seven months to publish the SARS sequence in May 2003 after the first case of pneumonia was reported in China in late 2002. The Chinese government published the full genomic sequence for this coronavirus on Jan. 10.\n\n\"Today you don't need to get the virus in hand,\" Fauci said. \"All you need is a sequence because the platforms that we use in vaccinology now are generally gene-based or molecular ribonucleic acid-based.\"\n\nWhat are researchers most concerned about?\n\nOne of the unknowns is the virus's reproductive number, pronounced R-naught, which helps determine how fast the virus is spreading. Current estimates put the R0 range between 1.5 and 3.1, though the available data is still limited, Pekosz said. \"It's going to tell us how difficult it will be to contain this virus,\" he said.\n\nSARS had a R0 of 2 to 5; post-quarantine, it dropped below 1, which indicates an outbreak is waning, Dr. Eric Ding, an epidemiologist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health said during a Tuesday Evercore ISI webinar.\n\nHow is this coronavirus different than SARS or MERS?\n\nU.S. health officials have said the new coronavirus, which was first identified in December in Wuhan City, China, is more similar to SARS than Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), although all three are coronaviruses. However, there are a number of key differences.\n\n\"The underlying context is different,\" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital. \"Fifteen years ago, the difference of course is less mobility, less movement within and outside of China than what we see today.\"\n\nEarly data out of China shows that the new coronavirus had primarily sickened patients who skewed younger and healthier than those commonly affected by seasonal flu or SARS. About half of this cohort of 41 patients who had been hospitalized in Wuhan were between the ages of 25 and 49 years old, about 73% were men, and less than half of them had co-morbidities such as diabetes or hypertension. The fatality rate for this coronavirus is also thought to be lower, at about 3% to 4%. The MERS morbidity rate is about 36% and SARS is 10%.\n\nPublic health experts cautioned that this is very early data and likely not reflective of the thousands more patients who have now been diagnosed with the virus.\n\nBig health care companies share coronavirus plans: Much of the development news for coronavirus diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines so far has come from smaller preclinical companies. However, Johnson & Johnson JNJ+0.7% for 2019-nCoV and is also providing its antiviral HIV treatment Prezcobix in China for investigational purposes. HIV is a RNA-based virus, like the Wuhan coronavirus. Becton Dickinson and Co. BDX-0.02% the diagnostics company, is sending instruments used in diagnostic testing to China, according to a FactSet transcript of its earnings call.\n\nEarnings calls have turned into de facto corporate updates on the virus: According to a FactSet analysis of earnings transcripts, executives at Boeing Co. BA+1.72% Dow Inc. DOW+5.32% General Electric Co. GE+10.32% Mastercard Inc. MA+0.02% and Starbucks Inc. SBUX-2.12% have been asked or are discussing the impact of the coronavirus on their 2020 performance. A Mastercard executive said: \"It's early days. Fortunately, a decent portion of our inbound and outbound cross-border from China is e-commerce related so it provides some level of a hedge.\"\n\nTravel operators, airport retailers face demand slump: Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL+1% said may mean the company will have to lower its 2020 per-share earnings by 10 cents. Carnival Corp. CCL said suspended cruises may lead to a EPS headwind of $0.03 to $0.04 per share, according to a Nomura note. Separately, a decline in Chinese travelers may force airport retailers to market to other travelers. \"If outbound tourism from China suffers as a result of coronavirus, airport operators and retailers must adapt their strategies to target other passengers,\" GlobalData's Honor Strachan in a research note.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday that he spoke to Chinese Premier Xi Jinping about the coronavirus and that the U.S. and China are working closely on the issue.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

arrogance and greed in the stock market", "body": "A slight pullback in the stock market, following a huge rally, may not be a buying opportunity\n\nIt is no secret that the stock market is driven by greed and fear. Normally I measure levels of greed and fear in the market using proven algorithms. At extremes, greed is a sell signal and fear is a buy signal for stocks.\n\nThe reaction to the coronavirus shows that there is an unprecedented amount of arrogance among the momo (momentum) crowd and the people who influence them. The stock market these days is controlled by the momo crowd. This combination of greed and arrogance may prove to be dangerous for investors. Let's examine the danger with the help of two charts.\n\nTwo chart\n\nPlease click for an annotated chart of the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust DIA, -2.12%, which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.09%. For the sake of full transparency, this chart was previously published and nothing has been changed since then.\n\nPlease click for an annotated intraday chart of the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, -1.59%, which tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index NDX, -1.58% . Similar conclusions can be drawn from the chart of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -1.82%.\n\nNote the following:\n\n* Smart money sold into the strength when the momo crowd proclaimed that the coronavirus was not of concern and the tiny dip in the stock market was a buying opportunity.\n\n* The first chart shows that the trendline that has been in place during the latest acceleration in the stock market was broken on the coronavirus news.\n\n* The first chart shows the support zone. If the stock market pulls back to the support zone, it may make sense to think in terms of buying opportunities.\n\n* The first chart shows the Arora signal to raise cash and hedges near the highs in the stock market before the breakdown on coronavirus news. Based on this signal, the Arora Report long-term portfolios have been up to 63% protected.\n\n* The first chart shows Arora signals to short-sell QQQ for a short-term trade. For those who could not short the signal was also given to buy the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF SQQQ, +4.89%. This inverse ETF goes up when the stock market goes down. (Bear in mind that short-selling and leverage ought to be used only by sophisticated investors.)\n\n* The first chart shows RSI divergence. This is a negative.\n\n* The second chart shows the gap down on the coronavirus news.\n\n* The second chart shows proclamation of a buying opportunity by the momo crowd.\n\n* The VUD indicator on the second chart shows aggressive buying after the momo crowd gurus proclaimed that the coronavirus was not of concern. The VUD indicator is the most sensitive measure of net supply demand in real time.\n\nEarnings\n\nSince the coronavirus news, Apple AAPL, -4.43% and Microsoft MSFT, -1.48% have reported exceptionally strong sales and earnings. However, both of these success stories should have already been discounted in the elevated stock prices.\n\nPlease see .\n\nFacebook FB, -3.64% with its earnings report.\n\nSemiconductors have been the leading indicator of this stock market. Among semiconductors, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, -3.65% and Xilinx XLNX, -3.12% reported weaker than expected earnings but Lam Research LRCX, -4.10% did better than expected.\n\nPlease see and .\n\nTesla TSLA, +1.52% reported a after the recent epic short squeeze.\n\nGreed and arrogance\n\nMost investors are familiar with greed. Please see for the level of greed.\n\nWould you say that there is extreme arrogance after considering the following points?\n\n* The momo crowd, who are not virologists or epidemiologists, quickly declared that coronavirus was of no concern.\n\n* Such proclamations happened at a time when epidemiologists and virologist were concerned.\n\n* It was known that the virus had an incubation period of up to two weeks.\n\n* It was known that asymptomatic patients were contagious.\n\n* It was known that about 5 million people managed to flee the epicenter of the virus and were not likely to be tracked.\n\n* There were serious concerns about the transparency of the information coming out of China. After all, no government would want to spread panic. It would seem to be in a government's interest to skew the statistics to minimize the impact.\n\n* The buy signals were being given only after a pullback of only 2% to 3%, following a massive rally.\n\nI previously wrote that there was 90% probability that the virus would be contained but investors should not ignore the small probability of a significant spread.\n\nConsider watching the SPDR Gold Shares ETF GLD, +0.58%, the iShares Silver Trust SLV, +0.84% and the United States Oil Fund LP USO, -2.17%.

--  but that also explains why it's so contagious", "body": "An effective virus can extend its reach by not killing its host too quickly and/or sustain a long incubation period like HIV\n\nTwo months into the epidemic, the coronavirus has not proven to be as deadly as the SARS virus. That, however, may also help explain why it's spreading so quickly. It has an incubation period of up to two weeks, which enables the virus to spread through person-to-person contact.\n\nThe coronavirus, a highly contagious, pneumonia-causing illness that infects the respiratory tract, is now responsible for 170 deaths in China as of Thursday and 7,711 infections worldwide, according to Chinese officials and .\n\n\"There are likely to be many times more cases in Wuhan than officially confirmed,\" Neil Ferguson, a disease modeler at Imperial College London, .\n\nThe paper also said some families have voiced their concern and frustration that their relatives' cause of death was marked as \"severe pneumonia\" or \"viral pneumonia\" on their death certificates. \"Clearly, the hospitals are overwhelmed,\" Ferguson also said.\n\nCases have already surpassed 5,327, the total number SARS cases reported in China during that 2002-2003 epidemic. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, infected 8,096 people worldwide with approximately 774 official SARS-related deaths.\n\nSARS had a fatality rate of 9.6% compared to the fatality rate of 2.2% for the coronavirus.\n\ncompared to the fatality rate of 2% for the coronavirus. However, that death toll could rise as the weeks progress, and drug companies scramble to come up with a vaccine for the virus. Whether the fatality rate remains steady has yet to be determined.\n\nThe difference in these two fatality rates gives more context as to why the coronavirus has spread so quickly. Medical experts say an effective flu-like virus can extend its reach by not killing its host too rapidly and/or making the host sick enough to pass it on before finally becoming bedridden.\n\n\"Every now and then a disease becomes so dangerous that it kills the host,\" Matan Shelomi, an entomologist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University, . But, ideally for the host at least, it must strike a balance.\n\n\"If the disease is able to spread to another host before the first host dies, then it is not too lethal to exist. Evolution cannot make it less lethal so long as it can still spread,\" he added. \"If a hypothetical disease eradicates its only host, both will indeed go extinct.\"\n\n'The strain of the Black Death plague (Yersinia pestis) from the 14th Century was too virulent and is now extinct.'\n\nThat, he said, is why the Black Death, which ravaged much of Europe and Asia in the Middle Ages is now extinct. \"The strain of the Black Death plague (Yersinia pestis) from the 14th Century was too virulent and is now extinct,\" with only modern, less devastating strains in existence.\n\nAnimals are useful for viruses to jump humans. \"The animal is the disease reservoir,\" Shelomi wrote. \"Even if all humans were vaccinated against such a disease, we'd need to vaccinate the animal reservoir too in order to eradicate the disease, which is impractical if not impossible.\"\n\nOther far more deadly viruses have taken more than half a century to become a global epidemic. For instance, it's widely understood that HIV originated in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo around 1920 when the virus crossed over from chimpanzees to humans.\n\n\"Up until the 1980s, we do not know how many people were infected with HIV or developed AIDS. HIV was unknown and transmission was not accompanied by noticeable signs or symptoms,\" , a global information and education resource on the disease.\n\nRecommended:\n\nHIV/AIDS has an incubation period of 40 to 60 days, although that can vary wildly. \"The current epidemic started in the mid to late 1970s,\" Avert said. \"By 1980, HIV may have already spread to five continents. In this period, between 100,000 and 300,000 people could have already been infected.\"\n\nBut the virus took hold in the years following the sexual revolution, with the first reported cases in the U.S. among gay men in 1981 and intravenous drug users. Untreated, it has a fatality rate of almost 100%. To date, 75 million people have contracted HIV with .\n\nLike HIV, the coronavirus has created its own brand of fear and loathing. Rumors about whether it began in a food market in Wuhan have led to , the U.K., Malaysia and South Korea, and elsewhere, and .\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping told the World Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus this week, \"Chinese people are currently engaged in a serious struggle against an epidemic of a new type of coronavirus infection. The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide.\"\n\nOther deadly viruses have taken more than half a century to become a global epidemic.\n\nHowever, reports that more than half-a-dozen doctors first discussed the threat of a potential coronavirus outbreak in early December only to be silenced by the local Communist Party has led critics to speculate that more could have been done after the first diagnosis.\n\nYaxue Cao, founder and editor of the political pressure group ChinaChange.org, said a Wuhan doctor said in a WeChat group in late December that there were \"7 cases of SARS connected to the seafood market.\" He was then scolded by the party disciplinary office, and forced to retract that, Cao said.\n\n\"From the same report, we learned that Wuhan health authorities were having overnight meetings about the new 'SARS' at end of December,\" Cao posted . \"Earlier today the Wuhan mayor said he was not 'authorized' to publicize the epidemic until Jan. 20.\"\n\nWuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang said before travel restrictions were imposed ahead of the Chinese New Year. Ma Xiaowei, the director of China's National Health Commission, said that the virus had an .\n\nChina has taken major steps to help prevent the spread of the virus. Officials in Wuhan, a city of 11 million residents that is widely regarded as the epicenter of the illness, last week closed the area's outgoing airport and railway stations and suspended all public transport.\n\nChinese officials have since expanded that travel ban to 16 surrounding cities with a combined population of more than 50 million people, including Huanggang, a neighboring city to Wuhan with 7.5 million people, effectively putting those cities on lockdown.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that it has confirmed the first case of person-to-person spread of coronavirus in Illinois. There are now six confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S., two of which are in Illinois.\n\nThe sixth case is the husband of the first confirmed case in Illinois, a woman in her 60s, and did not travel to Wuhan, China, the city that first identified the novel coronavirus. There are now 21 people under investigation in Illinois and 165 in the U.S., according to the CDC.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors":

benefits no longer growing faster despite unemployment at 50-year low", "body": "The numbers: The lowest unemployment rate in 50 years still isn't leading to big increases in wages and benefits for American workers.\n\nThe closely followed employment cost index rose 0.7% in the fourth quarter, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. That matched the MarketWatch forecast.\n\nYet the increase in wages and benefits in 2019 slowed to a 2.7% pace from a post 2008 recession high of 2.9% in 2018. Other measures of pay and benefits also signal that the growth in compensation appears to have peaked.\n\n\"It's a bit surprising that with sustained levels of historically low unemployment we haven't seen wages moving up above [3%],\" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said a few days ago.\n\nRead:\n\nWhat happened: Wages rose 0.7% in the fourth quarter. They make up about 70% of employment costs. Benefits make up the rest of worker compensation. They increased 0.5%.\n\nWages and salaries have risen 2.9% in the past 12 months, down from 3.1% in 2018.\n\nSimilarly, the increase in benefits slowed to a 2.2% yearly rate from 2.8%. That's the slowest pace in three years.\n\nSome workers have made out better than others, however. Wages and benefits for blue-collar workers in goods-producing industries, for instance, have risen 3.4% in the past year, the largest gain in almost 20 years.\n\nMany manufacturers have complained about a scarcity of skilled workers, suggesting they've boosted compensation in part to lure workers.\n\nThe ECI reflects how much companies, governments and nonprofit institutions pay employees in wages and benefits.\n\nRead:\n\nAlso:\n\nBig picture: With worker pay no longer growing faster, households probably won't be able to spend much more than they already do.\n\nThe result could be slower consumer spending in 2020 -- and a slower U.S. economy. Consumers have fueled most of the growth during a record expansion now in its 11th year.\n\nThe strong labor market and steady consumer spending, however, likely preclude the possibility of recession any time soon.\n\nRead:\n\nWhat they are saying? \"Wage growth has not picked up despite a tightening of the labor market,\" said Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macroresearch.\n\nMarket reaction:The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.41% and S&P 500 SPX, -1.23% sank again in Friday trades.

However, his prediction that the market is more likely to decline by half that much indicates that he's forecasting a retreat from stocks that have hovered near records rather than a traditional correction.\n\nWall Street investors, perhaps, shouldn't need the strategist to determine the current state of the equities, however.\n\n, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.57% slid 453.93 points, or 1.6%, to 28,535.80, following an intraday nadir at 28,440.47, while those for the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.57% slid 51.84 points, or 1.6%, to 3,243.63, with an intraday low at 3,234.50.

The Dow and S&P 500, marked their worst daily skids since Oct. 2, and the Nasdaq Composite logged its worst day since Aug, 23, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nStock markets have traded south in the past several sessions, with the Dow momentarily losing its grip on gains for 2020, as a rapidly spreading virus in China has sparked fears of a global outbreak that could curtail economic expansion in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nChinese health officials said the coronavirus -- an illness akin to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome -- has spread, infecting more than 2,800 people and claiming at least 80 lives around Wuhan city, China, where it reportedly originated.\n\nHowever, Wilson said that the market's slump is likely to be limited due to a Federal Reserve that has proven quick to provide liquidity to stalled-out markets as well as ultralow interest rates, which currently stand at a 1.50%-1.75% range. The Fed holds a two-day meeting beginning on Tuesday.\n\nRead:\n\nWilson said he expected the S&P 500, including defensive names, to continue to outperform emerging market assets and small-caps.\n\nThe analyst and his research team explain it this way:\n\nWhile near-term risks have increased, we think that corrections at the index level will be contained to 5 percent or less while the defensive skew outperforms both growth and cyclicals until rates show some signs of actually bottoming or hard data suggests the recovery will be more robust than we currently expect.\n\nCheck out the attached chart:\n\nCheck out:\n\nIt is important to note that a number of analysts have said that financial markets, which have been trading near all-time highs, . Cases have turned up in other countries, including five in the U.S., as well as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and France.\n\nIn July of 2018, Wilson accurately predicted that the market would see its largest correction in months, with the rally showing signs of \"exhaustion.\" He wrote then: \"The bottom line for us is that we think the selling has just begun and this correction will be biggest since the one we experienced in February.\"\n\nHowever, his more recent predictions have been less on the mark, .", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Vladimir and Estragon expect their friend to come along any time; policymakers remain hopeful higher inflation will finally emerge, more than a decade into the economic expansion and after . But the Fed's efforts may prove just as futile as expecting resolution in according to one analyst.\n\nAs Steve Blitz, chief economist for TS Lombard, argued in a recent research note, \"What the FOMC said in its statement about growth and inflation trends is what arrived in the Q4 GDP data.\"\n\nWhile the headline number for fourth-quarter gross domestic product wasn't too bad -- -- it's the details that matter, Blitz said. When imports and inventory, which are the factors most influenced by tariffs and tariff threats -- and their removal -- are stripped out, the economy probably only grew at about a 1.5% rate, he thinks.\n\n\"That pace is, in fact, almost as low as the 1.4% rate set in Q4 2018 -- the slowdown that, in turn, helped kick off the Fed's ,\" Blitz wrote.\n\nA slowing economy does not produce higher inflation. And policymakers know it's already too low, said strategists at TD Securities. \"Officials are now signaling that unchanged Fed policy in the year ahead is conditional on inflation 'returning to' 2%, rather than being 'near' 2%,\" they wrote. \"The slight change appears to have been intended to make clear that officials view the current trend in inflation as too low; the latest 12 month-change in core PCE prices is 1.6%.\"\n\nOn Friday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.90% was yielding 1.53%, the lowest in several months.\n\nBut Blitz thinks policymakers won't take any steps to try to coax inflation higher -- mostly because their hands are tied. The committee \"appears set to tough out any near term disinflationary data believing it is temporary and doing more now would run policy up against its new third bound, financial risk.\"\n\nThat rock-and-a-hard-place reality comes even as new unknowns spring up. The deadly coronavirus has prompted an -- that is, a situation in which than those with longer durations.\n\n\"If the curve stays inverted financial conditions will tighten -- lending growth at small banks has yet to recover from the prior inversion,\" Blitz noted. \"There are reasons why the Fed worked to . The risk now is that the virus' impact on the curve remains in place and then weak Q1 growth inverts the curve further. The Fed today is set to wait to react to the undoing of its work last year. But if events do unfold such that the curve becomes more inverted and stays that way, by the time the Fed sees the data triggers to cut rates, the economy is probably already slipping into recession.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_riquier@marketwatch.com", "name": "Andrea Riquier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Blitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_expansion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic expansion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Beckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lombardy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lombardy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 8}], "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HZ415_jerome_ZG_20200131103141.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 24}, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 24, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1428047393", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-29", "time": "19:06:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-29T19:06:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-29T19:05:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-epidemic-is-a-demon-coronavirus-set-to-exceed-total-sars-infections-in-days-2020-01-29", "title": "Coronavirus infections top 7,700, close to surpassing 2002-2003 SARS outbreak", "body": "'Chinese people are currently engaged in a serious struggle against an epidemic of a new type of coronavirus infection'\n\nIf the current infection rate continues, the coronavirus will exceed the number of total worldwide cases of SARS.\n\nThe coronavirus, a contagious, pneumonia-causing illness that infects the respiratory tract, is now responsible for 170 deaths in China as of Wednesday and 7,711 infections worldwide, with the number of cases nearly quadrupling since the weekend, China's National Health Commission said.\n\nIt has already surpassed 5,327, the total number SARS cases reported in China during that 2002-2003 epidemic.

"body": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- The coronavirus is getting a bum rap as the cause of the stock market's recent weakness.\n\nThat , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.36% was at one point down more than 500 points.\n\nIt's not that any of us should have sympathy for the virus, of course. But I don't want to let the real culprit get off scot-free.\n\nThat real culprit is market sentiment: Short-term stock market timers, on balance, have been extraordinarily bullish for a couple of months now. Even a few days of such excessive bullishness would normally lead to market weakness, much less a few months of such exuberance. So conditions were ripe for a pullback.\n\nIf it weren't the coronavirus, in other words, something else would have been the straw breaking the camel's back.\n\nRead:\n\nConsider the average recommended stock-market exposure level among the several dozen short-term stock market timers I monitor on a daily basis. (This average exposure level is what is reflected in the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index, or HSNSI.) As you can see from the chart above, the HSNSI since October of last year has spent more days above the 90th percentile of past daily readings than below.\n\nIn fact, there has been no other three-month period since I started compiling the data in 2000 during which the average HSNSI level has been as high as it has been since October.\n\nSo, unless the role human psychology plays in the stock market has suddenly changed, a correction was overdue.\n\nHow big of a correction? Contrarians' answer is that it depends on how traders react. It would be a good sign if they rush to the sidelines and then quickly jump onto the bearish bandwagon. In contrast, it would be a bad sign if they stubbornly hold onto their bullishness in the wake of the decline. In that case, contrarians would expect that an even deeper correction would be necessary to rebuild the Wall of Worry that would support a new leg upwards.\n\nRead:\n\nThe usual qualifications apply, however. Most importantly, there are no guarantees. For example, the stock market in recent weeks continued higher even though market sentiment was unfavorable -- . Furthermore, even if contrarian analysis turn out to be right in coming weeks, its forecasts apply only to the very short term, telling us little if anything about the market's intermediate and longer-term trends.\n\nThe bottom line: You shouldn't have been surprised by the stock market's current weakness.

We ignore the familiar dangers of day-to-day living -- like driving on the highways -- but obsess over rare and distant threats to our well-being -- such as the current boogeyman, which has killed more than 150 people in China and .\n\nA young relative asked me Wednesday if I thought she should wear a face mask to guard against the coronavirus. I told her she ought to worry about influenza instead. Get vaccinated, wash your hands often, don't put your fingers in your eyes, nose or mouth, and stay away from people who are coughing, I said.\n\nAnd a face mask gives people an exaggerated sense of safety, I told her. They are helpful only in limited situations, such as when you are stuck inside with lots of people.\n\nWe certainly don't need another disease that kills on the same scale as the flu.\n\nFortunately, that advice about basic hygiene applies whether you're worried about catching the flu, the common cold or the coronavirus. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine against this coronavirus, and there won't be soon enough to have any impact in this year's outbreak.\n\nRead:\n\nNo comparison\n\nFor most Americans, the risk of getting sick or dying from influenza is much greater than the risk from coronavirus. Already during this flu season, about 15 million Americans have been infected and more than 8,000 have died. Worldwide, flu kills about 650,000 people every year.\n\n\"When we think about the relative danger of this new coronavirus and influenza, there's just no comparison,\" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, \"Coronavirus will be a blip on the horizon in comparison. The risk is trivial.\"\n\nAnd yet, there is no breathless news coverage of the seasonal flu. There's no sense of urgency or panic. No cities are quarantined. No flights are canceled. to stock up on face masks to protect against the flu, as there has been since the reports of coronavirus spiked.\n\nTrue, several school districts around the country have canceled classes because a lot of the kids have the flu, but the rest of us mostly go on with our lives.\n\nA lot of people are so complacent about the flu that they won't take even the simplest precautions. Only about 45% of adults get which is cheap, readily available and has few side effects. What's with the other 55%?\n\nI suppose they think: Flu happens, why stress?\n\nThe shock of the new\n\nSo why all the interest in a disease halfway around the world?\n\nPart of it is fear of the unknown. So little is known about this novel virus -- about how easily it is transmitted, how deadly it might be, how successful the efforts to contain it will be, and about what useful treatments might be developed.\n\nNews by definition covers what's new, what's novel, what grabs people's attention. There's a reason that the papers only report it when a man bites a dog, and not the other way around. Flu isn't news; this other virus is.\n\nWe are all familiar with the flu, diabetes, Alzheimer's, heart disease and other ailments that We know about contagious diseases such as measles, mumps, malaria and chickenpox.\n\nBut when a new disease pops up with an exotic name -- HIV, Ebola, SARS, MERS -- we pay attention. One doctor joked to reporter that the flu should be rebranded: \"We should rename influenza; call it XZ-47 virus, or something scarier.\"\n\nRead:\n\nWe've been relatively lucky so far. Of the newly arrived diseases, only HIV has killed in massive numbers, and we now have effective treatments for that.\n\nBut if we don't corral this coronavirus soon, it may escape into the world to infect millions of people every year, like the flu does. We certainly don't need another disease that kills on the same scale as the flu.\n\nThe Chinese have mismanaged their response, leading us to question whether they are being straightforward with the facts even now. They initially downplayed the extent of the problem and then tried to quarantine entire cities with tens of millions of residents instead of focusing on those who were more likely to have been in contact with infected people.\n\nCompetence of strangers\n\nThe scariest thing about a pandemic is that there's very little individuals can do to protect themselves beyond the usual nostrums about hand washing and avoiding crowds. We must rely on the kindness and competence of strangers, because taming a pandemic requires a high level of trust, cooperation, preparation and expert health care.\n\nThose things are in short supply in today's world.\n\nInternational cooperation and trust in national governments are ebbing. Our just-in-time economy means that no one has stockpiled the things that would be needed in a crisis: the extra hospital beds, the containment equipment, and even doctors, nurses, and aides. The internet rumor mill has eroded faith in the expertise we'd need in a pandemic.\n\nMaybe this crisis in China will move us to get ready to act instantly for the inevitable arrival of a novel virus that -- unlike this coronavirus -- is both very contagious and very deadly.\n\nIf we aren't prepared, hundreds of millions will die when that virus surfaces.\n\nEven if we all scrub our hands.\n\nRead MarketWatch's Coronavirus update:", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rex_nutting@marketwatch.com", "name": "Rex Nutting", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surgical mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flu season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preventive healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chickenpox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ebola virus disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 15}], "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HZ315_hand_w_ZG_20200130101932.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 19}, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 19, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1430770129", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-31", "time": "20:34:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-31T20:34:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-31T20:33:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/investors-brace-for-vicious-plunge-in-chinese-stocks-when-exchanges-re-open-2020-01-31", "title": "Investors brace for plunge in Chinese stocks when exchanges re-open Monday", "body": "The whirlwind selloff in global stock markets has left the epicenter of the coronavirus mostly unscathed as Chinese equity exchanges have stayed shuttered this week.\n\nBut analysts expect Chinese equities to catch up with swooning stocks in Asia and the U.S. when their local bourses resume business on Feb. 3, as local traders return back to their desks from the Lunar New Year holiday. A plunge in Chinese equities could spur another vicious round of selling in global stocks amid worries that the global economic rebound expected this year may fall flat due to the viral outbreak.\n\n\"Financial markets, in Asia in particular, have reacted negatively to news reports of the virus spreading in recent days,\" wrote Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for UBS Wealth Management. \"Chinese equities may suffer further declines when they re-open after the Lunar New Year holiday.\"\n\nThe number of confirmed cases of the virus has risen close to 10,000, and 213 deaths have been reported, according to Beijing. A host of countries, including the U.S. and Japan, have advised against travel to China, while American Airlines, Inc. AAL, -3.17% and Delta Air lines, Inc. DAL, -2.38% said their U.S. to China-bound flights will be temporarily suspended.\n\nIn addition, the coronavirus' spread is expected to hurt the Chinese services sector, which has seen its share of the overall economic pie increase as Beijing reorients its economy toward more domestic-focused industries.\n\n\"The near-term economic impact appears substantial. In addition to disruptions to production, avoidance of face-to-face contact may have resulted in a sharp fall in service activity,\" said economists at Standard Chartered in a Friday note.\n\nSee:\n\nMeanwhile, some Exchange-Traded Funds have continued trading throughout this week, potentially providing a glimpse into the coming action. Mainland Chinese equity markets have been closed since Jan. 24.\n\nThe Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China Index ETF ASHR, -1.89% , which tracks the biggest stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, fell nearly 8% this week and is on track for an almost 11% loss this year.\n\nThis may suggest a steep drop awaits companies underpinning the CSI 300 index 000300, -3.10%, which already are trading at a 2.3% loss for the year.\n\nOther Asian markets that reopened earlier from the New Year holiday took a beating. The Taiwan TAIEX index Y9999, +0.64% slumped more than 5% in the last two days after their markets restarted trading on Thursday.\n\nIn the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.09% was on pace for a more than 2% drop this week, which would mark its biggest weekly loss since August and push the blue-chip index into the red for the year.\n\nRead:\n\nYet, those bullish on emerging markets and Chinese equities have indicated that any selloff is likely to be a knee-jerk response, and could present a chance to buy stocks on the cheap for those steely enough to withstand the expected market decline.\n\n\"Given the valuation differential between U.S. and Chinese markets, the dip in Chinese stocks spurred by the outbreak may provide an opportunity to capitalize on a meaningful discount in equity markets in China,\" said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer of KraneShares, a provider of exchange-traded funds specializing in Chinese stocks.\n\nHe pointed out the price to earnings ratio for Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -2.75% constituents stood at 14.17 as of Jan. 30, versus the S&P 500's SPX, -1.77% ratio of 21.96.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType":
