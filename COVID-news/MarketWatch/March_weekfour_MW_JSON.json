You know, you go into major hospitals, sometimes they'll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they're saying, 'can we order 30,000 ventilators?'\" \"\n\n-- President Donald Trump\n\n\"I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be,\" Trump said, noting that ventilators are expensive to make.\n\n\"Look, it's a very bad situation,\" he continued. \"We haven't seen anything like it. But the end result is we gotta get back to work and I think we can start by opening up certain parts of the country.\"\n\nthat in a worst-case scenario, between 2.4 million and 21 million Americans could require hospitalization -- many of whom would require ventilators. There are an estimated 100,000 ventilators in the U.S. and some predict that the U.S. could need up to 750,000 to deal with the pandemic, .\n\nAt one Manhattan hospital, the number of patients needing ventilators more than doubled in three days, reported, \"a pace that exceeds the overall increase in new cases,\" . \"We have not exhausted out existing supply of ventilators, but if we keep doubling every three days we might.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo blasted the federal response to the coronavirus crisis in his state, and especially hard-hit New York City. He said the state urgently needed 30,000 ventilators, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency had only committed to sending 400.\n\n\"You want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators?\" . \"What are we going to do with 400 ventilators?

Those efforts to dull the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 are putting the U.S. economy into a recession and have tanked U.S. equity markets that were just a month ago at record highs.\n\nSee:\n\nThe illness that carried by the novel strain of coronavirus first identified in China in December has been contracted by some 414,000 people and killed more than 18,000 across the globe, according to , as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn the U.S., where the epidemic is likely still in its nascence, some 51,542 have been infected.\n\nTrump, however, said on Tuesday during a Fox News interview in the White House Rose Garden that he hopes to have the country reopened as early as Easter on April 12, though most countries have taken months to achieve some semblance of managing the infection.\n\nTrump has argued that a longer U.S. shutdown would make it more difficult for the economy to rebound from a recession. \"The longer it takes, the longer we stay out, the longer that is to do,\" he explained.\n\nRead:\n\nAn early end to the lockdown in the U.S. has been viewed as ill-advised by many experts and politicians who fear that lives would be sacrificed in the bid to resume business-as-usual, and achieve a stock-market rebound, before the virus subsides.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose updates on the virus's impact on the Empire State have been closely followed, similar to those of Gates on Tuesday. \"No American is going to say, accelerate the economy at the cost of human life, because no American is going to say how much a life is worth. Job [No. 1] has to be save lives,\" the governor said.\n\nSee:\n\nGates told TED, according to Recode, that \"it's very irresponsible for somebody to suggest that we can have the best of both worlds,\" referring to mitigating the impact of the deadly pathogen on human lives and keeping the economy whirring.\n\nU.S., and global, stock markets have been in turmoil due to the viral outbreak, with some at least partly attributing by the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +5.09%, up 11.4%, to a belief that Trump's administration , despite public health experts indicating that such a move would likely be premature. Noted infectious-diseases specialist Anthony Fauci suggested at a late-afternoon news conference at the White House that it might be worth exploring an idea floated by Trump that some sections of the country could have restrictions eased ahead of others.\n\nThe Dow surged 2,112 points on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +5.18% soared 9.4%, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +4.38% finished Tuesday's session up 8.1%.\n\nGates, who boasts a net worth of $94.6 billion, (making him the second wealthiest man in the world behind Amazon.com's AMZN, +2.68% Jeff Bezos) is among a group of billionaire philanthropists who have said they would give away at least half their wealth to charities under terms of the Giving Pledge.

Payments start to decrease thereafter, and those who earn $99,000 as a single individual or $198,000 as a married couple will not receive any money. Heads of households have a limit of $146,500. Individuals with children will receive $500 for every child.\n\nSee:\n\nRecipients need to have a Social Security number and cannot be dependents for someone else to be eligible. Income is determined by a person's adjusted gross income, or AGI.\n\nThe extra income is part of a $2 trillion stimulus package focused on combating the consequences of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 551,000 people around the world and killed nearly 25,000. Part of includes relief to small businesses, which have been hit hard from state and city lockdowns, as well as more robust unemployment benefits. The Senate passed overnight on Thursday, and the House is expected to vote on it Friday afternoon.\n\nThe U.S. is now ranked with the highest number of confirmed cases, according to Whiting School of Engineering's Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Government and health care officials across the country expect to see countless more cases before the situation gets better.\n\nAlso see:\n\nThe checks, which are nontaxable, will be based on 2019 tax returns if they've already been filed (though the deadline has been delayed to ), and for those who have yet to send in their returns, 2018 figures. The checks are based on all income, which means retirees, Social Security and those who claim other benefits, such as Supplemental Security Income, are eligible. The government can use a beneficiary's Social Security statements to calculate the check amount if a person did not file taxes -- and send the check based on the information on file, according to .\n\nCertain cases may make it tricky for retirees to get the proper amount though, experts said. There are circumstances where retirees may have been working in 2018, or even 2019, and earning more than the income limits, but now are below those thresholds, said Jamie Hopkins, director of retirement research at Carson Group.\n\nThere are also instances where people may get more in their checks than they should have, such as for those who earned less in the previous year but more now. They will get to keep the full amount of the check, said Jeffrey Levine, director of advanced planning at Buckingham Wealth Partners.\n\nCongress has not yet shared how exactly the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service will handle special cases, nor have they said what the cutoff is for receiving 2019 tax returns to base their check calculations.

enforcement on a range of legally mandated public health and environmental protections, saying industries could have trouble complying with them during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe oil and gas industry were among the industries that had sought an advance relaxation of environmental and public health enforcement during the outbreak, citing potential staffing problems. The EPA's decision was sweeping, forgoing fines or other civil penalties for companies that failed to monitor, report or meet some other requirements for releasing hazardous pollutants.\n\nThe move was the latest, and one of the broadest, regulation-easing moves by the EPA, which is seeking to roll back dozens of regulations as part of President Donald Trump's purge of rules that the administration sees as unfriendly to business. Civil and criminal enforcement of polluters under the administration has fallen sharply.\n\nFormer Obama-era EPA chief Gina McCarthy, now president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the announcement \"an open license to pollute.\"\n\nThe administration was \"taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis to do favors for polluters that threaten public health,\" McCarthy said, in part of what was a flurry of condemnation from environmental groups to the announcement.\n\nIn a statement, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the open-ended waiver was temporary and retroactive to March 13.\n\n\"EPA is committed to protecting human health and the environment, but recognizes challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from COVID-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements,\" Wheeler said. \"This temporary policy is designed to provide enforcement discretion under the current, extraordinary conditions, while ensuring facility operations continue to protect human health and the environment.\"\n\nThe EPA directive said industries would be expected to comply with regulations \"where reasonably practicable.\" Businesses that broke regulations would have to be able to show that they tried to reduce the harm, and show how any violations were caused by the coronavirus outbreak, the EPA said.\n\nCollin O'Mara, president of the National Wildlife Federation, called the move \"an assault on our public health and an absolute abdication of the legal responsibilities of the EPA.\"\n\nThe EPA said the advance pass on enforcement did not apply to criminal violations by polluters.\n\nWhile there were circumstances where a disaster like the pandemic might make compliance impossible, those instances called for narrow decisions by regulators on clemency, said Cynthia Giles, a former senior EPA enforcement during the Obama administration.\n\nGiles said she knew of no previous time in the EPA's half-century history where it \"relinquished its fundamental authority\" as she said it did Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@marketwatch.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gina McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_R._Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew R.

So he sent out an optimistic report.\n\n\"This suggests that the rate of increase in number of the deaths will slow down even more over the next week,\" he said in a note widely shared on Chinese social media. Levitt, who won the 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry, also said the number of deaths would soon start decreasing every day.\n\nHe ultimately nailed his call for a mid-February peak with a total tally of about 80,000 cases and 3,250 deaths. As of March 16, China had counted a total of 80,298 cases and 3,245 deaths -- in a country of almost 1.4 billion people where about 10 million die every year.\n\nHe's got a similar view for the United States.\n\n\"What we need is to control the panic... we're going to be fine,\" he said, adding that the data doesn't support the gloom and doom epidemiologist have been warning about.\n\nLevitt looked at the stats from 78 countries with more than 50 reported cases of COVID-19 every day and sees \"signs of recovery,\" focusing on the number of new cases, not the cumulative figure.\n\n\"Numbers are still noisy but there are clear signs of slowed growth,\" he told the L.A. Times, claiming that, however, the trajectory of deaths in the U.S. back up his findings.\n\nThere are now 35,224 cases and 471 deaths in the U.S., as of Monday morning,. On Friday afternoon, there were 16,018 cases and 210 deaths.\n\nLevitt said social-distancing mandates and getting vaccinated against the flu are both critical to the fight against the spread. Italy's strong anti-vaccine movement, he explained, likely played a factor in the explosion of cases, because the spread of the flu likely was a factor in overwhelming hospitals and increasing the chances of coronavirus going undetected.\n\nHe lays some of the blame on the media for sparking panic by focusing on the increase in cumulative cases and spotlighting celebrities, like Tom Hanks and Idris Elba, who have been infected.\n\nLevitt is also worried that an overreaction could trigger another crisis, with lost jobs and hopelessness creating their own set of problems, such as a surge in suicide rate.\n\nOn Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said in the coming months as the world continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. If his projection proves true, unemployment would be worse than it was during the Great Depression and three times worse than the 2007-'09 recession.\n\nWhile those kinds headlines continue to spread fear, Levitt sticks by his simple message: The coronavirus pandemic is \"not the end of the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors":

He suggested they would survive better on \"artificial fibers\" such as polyester than on cotton.\n\nMedical professionals should take extra precautions\n\nChange clothes after being in a crowded area in which people have touched your clothes, said Robert Amler, the dean of New York Medical College's School of Health Sciences and Practice and a former chief medical officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After being in a public space in which others haven't brushed up against you, \"washing the clothes afterwards is a precaution, but may not be quite as necessary,\" he said.\n\n\"But it's still common sense to keep them laundered and clean, and where you have smooth-surface clothing like leather or vinyl, it makes sense to wipe them off if you've been in public spaces for extended periods of time,\" he added. \"These are make-sense recommendations and not scientifically based.\"\n\nadvise that caregivers for COVID-19 patients wash laundry thoroughly, removing and washing \"clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them\" immediately, and wear disposable gloves to touch the soiled items.\n\nCoronavirus had infected at least 105,573 people in the U.S. as of Saturday lunchtime and killed at least 1,711 people, 450 of which were in New York City, according to Johns Hopkins University.

That's my worry,\" he said. \"That's exactly what the virus wants.\"\n\nIf you do choose to launder your clothes more often...\n\n\"Hot water is better than cold,\" Dumois said, as coronaviruses tend to be sensitive to higher temperatures. \"The heat of a dryer also helps kill coronaviruses,\" he added. The soap and water you usually use in your washing machine should be sufficient, said Andujar Vazquez.\n\nAnd if you're washing your clothes at a laundromat, be sure to go at a time when it's not crowded and practice proper hand hygiene.\n\n\"Just assume that most of the surfaces in the laundromat are contaminated with somebody's viruses: the counter tops, the buttons on the machine, the handles to open and close the machine, the buttons on any change machine, the handle on the door to the laundromat to get in and out,\" Dumois said. \"Do not touch your face until you've had a chance to clean your hands.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meera_jagannathan@marketwatch.com", "name": "Meera Jagannathan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_T._H._Chan_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvard T.

about whether they need to wash or change their clothes to avoid catching COVID-19, infectious-disease experts say you generally don't need to do so more often than usual -- and some even warn that a preoccupation with laundry could come at the cost of taking more important measures like washing your hands.\n\nStill, there are some best practices to follow when you haul dirty clothes to the laundromat.\n\n\"The average person should not worry about their clothing,\" Sarah Fortune, a professor and chair of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, told MarketWatch in an email. \"If you are a health-care provider and potentially subject to a high density of virus, the answer is different. But for most of us, it is all about our hands and face.\"\n\n'If you are a health-care provider and potentially subject to a high density of virus, the answer is different. But for most of us, it is all about our hands and face.' Sarah Fortune, a professor and chair of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health\n\nCOVID-19 is believed to spread , between people who are within about six feet of each other and through droplets from a sick person's cough or sneeze, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. public-health experts and policy makers to reduce the disease's spread.\n\nPeople can possibly contract COVID-19 by touching an infected object or surface \"and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,\" but scientists don't believe this is the main mode of transmission, the CDC says.\n\nA study published last week in the found that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, up to 24 hours on cardboard, up to four hours on copper, and up to three hours in aerosols.\n\nWhile not much is known about how this particular virus interacts with clothing and fabric, \"coronaviruses in general last a lot longer on a solid, nonporous surface compared to porous fabrics,\" Juan Dumois, a pediatric infectious-diseases physician at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla., told MarketWatch. He suggested they would survive better on \"artificial fibers\" such as polyester than on cotton.\n\nMedical professionals should take extra precautions\n\nChange clothes after being in a crowded area in which people have touched your clothes, said Robert Amler, the dean of New York Medical College's School of Health Sciences and Practice and a former chief medical officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After being in a public space in which others haven't brushed up against you, \"washing the clothes afterwards is a precaution, but may not be quite as necessary,\" he said.\n\n\"But it's still common sense to keep them laundered and clean, and where you have smooth-surface clothing like leather or vinyl, it makes sense to wipe them off if you've been in public spaces for extended periods of time,\" he added. \"These are make-sense recommendations and not scientifically based.\"\n\nadvise that caregivers for COVID-19 patients wash laundry thoroughly, removing and washing \"clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them\" immediately, and wear disposable gloves to touch the soiled items.\n\nThe COVID-19 disease had infected at least 46,450 people in the U.S. by Tuesday morning and killed at least 593, according to data aggregated by . Worldwide, there were 387,382 confirmed cases and 16,767 deaths; 101,987 people had recovered as of Tuesday morning.\n\nWhat you do (and don't) need to worry about with your clothes\n\nGabriela Andujar Vazquez, an infectious-disease physician at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said that the average person didn't necessarily need to wash their clothes more often than usual after visiting the grocery store.\n\n\"It's perfectly safe for you to go back home with your regular clothes and just do what you have been doing pre-COVID,\" she said.\n\n'Sneeze particles with virus are going to last a lot longer on a desktop or countertop than on somebody's clothing.' Juan Dumois, a pediatric infectious-diseases physician at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital\n\nIn fact, it would be more important to wash your hands after touching clothes that somebody coughed on, she said. \"Wash your clothes as you usually do,\" she said. \"Just make sure that you wash your hands.\"\n\nDumois agreed. \"Sneeze particles with virus are going to last a lot longer on a desktop or countertop than on somebody's clothing.\"\n\nFaheem Younus, the chief of infectious diseases at the University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Health, urged focusing on measures that will yield the biggest return on investment, like staying home when sick, steering clear of sick people, keeping hands clean, avoiding handshakes, and maintaining distance from others.\n\n\"Those are the realities that we should be focusing on rather than changing clothes,\" he said. \"Our biggest bang for buck is social distancing from humans [and] washing our hands ... but at the same time, not worrying about surfaces to a point where it paralyzes us.\"\n\nAfter all, while Younus said he empathizes with people's concerns, \"this is going to be our life for the next few months\" -- and it might be difficult to sustain additional precautionary measures for an extended period of time.\n\n\"I think the same people who want to change their clothes and take a shower now -- in three weeks, they'll be shaking hands and they won't be able to maintain basic hand hygiene. That's my worry,\" he said. \"That's exactly what the virus wants.\"\n\nIf you do choose to launder your clothes more often...\n\n\"Hot water is better than cold,\" Dumois said, as coronaviruses tend to be sensitive to higher temperatures. \"The heat of a dryer also helps kill coronaviruses,\" he added. The soap and water you usually use in your washing machine should be sufficient, said Andujar Vazquez.\n\nAnd if you're washing your clothes at a laundromat, be sure to go at a time when it's not crowded and practice proper hand hygiene.\n\n\"Just assume that most of the surfaces in the laundromat are contaminated with somebody's viruses: the counter tops, the buttons on the machine, the handles to open and close the machine, the buttons on any change machine, the handle on the door to the laundromat to get in and out,\" Dumois said. \"Do not touch your face until you've had a chance to clean your hands.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meera_jagannathan@marketwatch.com", "name": "Meera Jagannathan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_T._H._Chan_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvard T.

the coronavirus", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the White House looks for ways to restore normalcy in parts of the U.S., the government's foremost infection disease expert says the country could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, offered his prognosis as the federal government weighs rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been as hard-hit by the outbreak at the conclusion of the nationwide 15-day effort to slow the spread of the virus.\n\n\"I would say between 100,000 and 200,000 cases,\" he said, correcting himself to say he meant deaths. \"We're going to have millions of cases.\" But he added \"I don't want to be held to that\" because the pandemic is \"such a moving target.\"\n\nAlso see:\n\nAbout 125,000 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. had been recorded as of Sunday morning, with over 2,100 dead. It is certain that many more have the disease but their cases have not been reported.\n\nOne in three Americans remain under state or local government orders to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus, with schools and businesses closed and public life upended.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, head of the White House coronavirus task force, said parts of the country with few cases so far must prepare for what's to come. \"No state, no metro area, will be spared,\" she said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nFauci said he would only support the rollback in lesser-impacted areas if more testing is in place to monitor those areas. He said \"it's a little iffy there\" right now.\n\nMost people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. Hospitals in the most afflicted areas are straining to handle patients and some are short of critical supplies.\n\nFauci's prediction would take the death toll well past that of the average seasonal flu. Trump repeatedly cited the flu's comparatively much higher cost in lives in playing down the severity of this pandemic.\n\nTrump had eyed a \"reopening\" of the U.S. economy by Easter, April 12, but in recent days medical professionals have warned that would be far too soon for the nation's heavily affected urban areas.\n\nJust on Saturday, Trump was discussing tightening restrictions, suggesting then backing away from an \"enforceable\" quarantine of hard-hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. Instead, the White House task force recommended a travel advisory for residents of those states to limit non-essential travel to slow the spread of the virus to other parts of the U.S.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that Trump shouldn't be so quick to reverse the social distancing guidelines, saying more testing needs to be in place to determine whether areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.\n\nTrump's \"denial\" in the crisis was \"deadly,\" she told CNN.\n\n\"As the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution,\" she said. She promised a congressional investigation once the pandemic is over to determine whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts and to answer the question that resonates through U.S. political scandals: \"What did he know and when did he know it?\"\n\nTrump minimized the gravity of the pandemic for weeks. Asked whether she is saying that attitude cost American lives, Pelosi said: \"Yes, I am. I'm saying that.\"\n\nIt put Pelosi out of lockstep with former vice president Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, who said he wouldn't go so far as to lay the blame for deaths on the president. \"I think that's a little too harsh,\" he told NBC.\n\nBiden faulted Trump for holding back on using his full powers under the recently invoked Defense Production Act to spur the manufacture of the full range of needed medical supplies -- and for making erratic statements about the pandemic.\n\n\"He should stop thinking out loud and start thinking deeply,\" Biden said.\n\nMeanwhile, governors in other hotspots across the country were raising alarm that the spread of the virus was threatening their health-care systems.\n\n\"We remain on a trajectory, really, to overwhelm our capacity to deliver health care,\" Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"By the end of the first week in April, we think the first real issue is going to be ventilators. And we think it's about the fourth or fifth of April before, down in the New Orleans area, we're unable to put people on ventilators who need them. And then several days later, we will be out of beds.\"\n\nHe said officials have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but so far have only been able to get 192.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@marketwatch.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

In the Netherlands growth in transmissions of the virus have slowed significantly.\n\nGiving evidence in front of the Dutch Parliament, Jaap van Dissel, head of the Netherlands National Institute of Health, said: \"The exponential growth of the outbreak has in all probability been brought to a halt,\" with the infection only being at a rate of one infected person to one other person.\n\nIf proven, this would be a significant achievement. In some countries, the average spread from one infected person has been to as many as five or more people. In the U.S., the state of New York had 5,146 new cases confirmed on Wednesday, and more than 30,000 have tested positive.\n\nRead:\n\nGermany, as of late Thursday, has had 43,646 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed, and 262 people have died, while 5,673 have recovered, according to compiled by the Whiting School of Engineering's Centers for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. There have been 7,459 confirmed Dutch cases and 435 deaths with six recoveries recorded.\n\nGermany's population is estimated at 84 million, and Holland's at 17.1 million.\n\nThe low death rate in Germany has confounded experts, and it could be due to several causes. The possible explanation is that doctors aggressively screened citizens who were either fit or early on in the sickness at the time they took the test, at a rate not seen in other countries, which only had the resources to test the very sick. This has skewed the comparison with other countries, because those who were fit when tested and had caught the virus were more likely to suffer from a mild case and survive.\n\nGermany also was than most countries at tracking and tracing the contacts of infected patients before the spread took hold, effectively containing it better than other countries.\n\nRead:\n\nAnother, more random, theory is that the first Germans to contract the virus caught it mixing with other nationalities while skiing, which suggested that they were fit and active, and perhaps less likely to succumb to the disease.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rupert_steiner@marketwatch.com", "name": "Rupert Steiner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_General_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States General of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exponential growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-ID064_berlin_ZG_20200325154225.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1879}, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 1879, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6005009803", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-23", "time": "20:58:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-23T20:58:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-23T20:58:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jm-smucker-to-pay-1500-hazard-pay-bonus-to-employees-amid-coronavirus-2020-03-23", "title": "J.M.

The legislation has been dubbed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\n\nThe new law is a daunting 880 pages long, but it contains lots of good news for individuals and businesses, including meaningful tax relief. This column explains one tax-relief measure that can potentially benefit many IRA owners. Here's what you need to know:\n\nCoronavirus-related distributions (CVDs) from IRAs are tax-favored\n\nIRA owners who are adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic (and there will be plenty of them) will be eligible to take tax-favored coronavirus-related distributions from their IRAs. To keep things simple, let's call these distributions CVDs. They can add up to as much as $100,000. You can recontribute a CVD back into your IRA within three years of the withdrawal date and treat the withdrawal and later recontribution as a totally tax-free rollover.\n\nIn effect, the CVD drill allows you to borrow up to $100,000 from your IRA(s) and repay the amount(s) any time up to three years later with no federal income tax consequences. And there are no limitations on what you can use CVD funds for during the three-year period.\n\n\" As long as you recontribute the entire CVD amount within the three-year window, the whole deal is treated as a tax-free IRA rollover transaction or a series of tax-free rollover transactions. \"\n\nIf you're cash-strapped, you can use the money to pay the bills and recontribute later when your financial situation has improved. You can help your adult kids out. You can pay down your HELOC. You can invest the money in the stock market and hope to collect low-taxed long-term gains. Whatever.\n\nYou can take one or more CVDs up to the $100,000 limit, and they can come from different IRAs. The three-year recontribution period for each CVD begins on the day after you receive it. You can make your recontributions in a lump sum, or you can make multiple recontributions. You can recontribute to one or several IRAs, and they don't have to be the same account(s) you took the CVD(s) from in the first place.\n\nAs long as you recontribute the entire CVD amount within the three-year window, the whole deal is treated as a tax-free IRA rollover transaction or a series of tax-free rollover transactions. If you're under age 59\u00bd, the dreaded 10% penalty tax that usually applies to early IRA withdrawals does not apply to CVDs.\n\nIf your spouse owns one or more IRAs in his or her own name, your spouse is apparently eligible for the same CVD deal if he or she qualifies.\n\nHow do you qualify for CVDs?\n\nGood question. Some IRA owners will clearly qualify while others may have to wait for IRS guidance. For now, here's what the CARES Act says.\n\nA coronavirus-related distribution is a distribution of up to $100,000 from an eligible retirement plan, including an IRA, that is made on or after 1/1/20 and before 12/31/20 to an individual:\n\n* Who is diagnosed with COVID-19 by a test approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n* Whose spouse or dependent (generally a qualifying child or relative who receives more than half of his or her support from you) is diagnosed with COVID-19 by such a test.\n\n* Who experiences adverse financial consequences as a result of being quarantined, furloughed, laid off, or having work hours reduced due to COVID-19.\n\n* Who is unable to work because of lack of child care due to COVID-19 and experiences adverse financial consequences as a result.\n\n* Who owns or operates a business that has closed or had operating hours reduced due to COVID-19 and has experienced adverse financial consequences as a result.\n\n* Who has experienced adverse financial consequences due to other COVID-19-related factors to be specified in future IRS guidance.\n\nWe need the IRS to weigh in on the last two factors. I hope and trust that the guidance will be liberally skewed in favor of the IRA owners of the world. Fingers crossed.\n\nWhat if I don't recontribute the CVD?\n\nAnother good question. You will be taxed on the CVD amount that you don't recontribute within the three-year window, but you don't have to worry about owing the dreaded 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59\u00bd.\n\nYou can choose to spread the taxable amount equally over three years, apparently starting with 2020. But here it gets tricky, because the three-year window won't close until sometime in 2023. Until then, it won't be clear that you failed to take advantage of the tax-free CVD rollover deal.\n\nSo, you may have to amend a prior-year return and report some additional taxable income from the CVD. Details to follow, because I don't think our beloved Congress gave much thought to this issue when drafting the CARES Act.\n\nYou also have the option of simply reporting the taxable income from the CVD on your 2020 Form 1040. You won't owe the 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59\u00bd.\n\nCan I take a CVD from my tax-favored company retirement plan?\n\nYes, if your company allows it under rules similar to those for IRAs. Employers and the IRS have work to do to figure out the details.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe CVD deal can be a helpful tax-favored financial arrangement for eligible IRA owners. Thankfully, the CARES Act includes a bevy of other potentially valuable tax breaks to help get us through this mess. Explaining them will keep us busy for a while.

That represented a significant decrease of 15 basis points from last week, when rates .\n\nMeanwhile, the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage fell 14 basis points to 2.92%. Apart from last week, the average rate for 15-year fixed home loans has remained below 3% since January.\n\nThe trajectory for the 5-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage was quite different, however. These rose a staggering 23 basis points to an average of 3.34%, the highest level since mid-January.\n\nRead more:\n\nJust three weeks ago, the average rate for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the 50 years Freddie Mac has tracked this data, at 3.29%. The rollercoaster ride that mortgage rates have been on in recent weeks is a reflection of the disruptions the coronavirus emergency has caused financial markets.\n\nMortgage rates roughly follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.683% , which dropped below 1% again this week after shooting much higher when the Federal Reserve announced it was cutting its benchmark interest rate and engaging in quantitative easing to help the economy weather the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Federal Reserve brought clarity to the mortgage market this week, which helped to stabilize rates. The Fed announced that it will engage in unlimited bond-buying in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which included purchases of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nBefore the Fed had stepped in, the mortgage market has seen \"phenomenal\" levels of volatility, said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group that represents lenders.\n\n\"It was so disruptive to the point that last week, lenders were really having trouble determining how to price loans when they weren't getting a clear signal from the capital markets as to what those rates should be,\" Fratantoni said. The Fed stepping in this week had a \"huge psychological benefit\" for lenders, which allowed them to feel comfortable bringing rates lower.\n\nAlso see:\n\nBut the Fed's actions aren't fool-proof, and real-estate experts warned that volatility could be here to stay for the mortgage market.\n\n\"Things may have settled down for now, but we're likely to see more volatile movements in mortgage rates as the next few weeks unfold, and some segments of the mortgage industry continue to face severe liquidity risks,\" said Zillow ZG, -7.11% economist Matthew Speakman.\n\nAnother factor in all of this will be the ability of lenders to handle loan volumes. When mortgage rates touched the 50-year low three weeks ago, refinance applications surged to record highs as homeowners scrambled to get cheaper financing. In turn, some lenders had to raise rates artificially to stem the demand and allow them to work through the deluge of applications they received.\n\nThat backlog of loan applications may still be a factor for some lenders -- especially as their workflows are hindered by the coronavirus as employees are forced to stay home for their health and safety.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com",

Josh Hawley of Missouri said there should be an international investigation \"into the origins of the coronavirus,\" and submitted legislation that calls for China to provide compensation for the economic impact.\n\nRising tensions, and what has so far been an American inability to stop the acceleration of new cases, are likely to lead to further decoupling of the U.S.-China economic relationship and push Europe into the arms of China, said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\"The pandemic is going to reinforce that the United States is simply not the highly functional, advanced role model it used to be,\" he said in an interview. \"The Europeans have, in the past, looked at the U.S. with a fair degree of awe,\" because of its innovative companies, strong university system and the ability to attract highly skilled immigrants.\n\n\"We are on a trajectory now to have a worse outbreak than Italy,\" he warned. \"This is going to reinforce the impression that the U.S. has nothing to teach the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe implications of what appears to be a pending geopolitical victory will be far-reaching for U.S. economy and businesses, said Eurasia Group's Bremmer. \"This will accelerate the deglobalization trend in data and manufacturing. It means that on issues like Huawei and 5G, the Europeans are less likely to follow the United States. And it increases the ability of the Chinese to follow its standards and join initiatives like One Belt, One Road,\" a Chinese global development strategy.\n\nThere may still be time for the U.S. to get the crisis under control and save face on the global stage. Serious social distancing measures have only been in place for a little more than a week in the hardest-hit areas of the United States, so it remains to be seen what effect they will have on containing the virus to already known hot spots like New York City, or on slowing the spread of the virus in those places.\n\nBut with President Donald Trump announcing that he'd like to have the economy \"opened up,\" , he runs the risk of convincing his supporters that the dangers posed by the virus have passed, before we understand the scope of the problem.\n\n\"Right now Americans are believing the same thing about the crisis,\" Bremmer said. \"In four weeks time that might not be true. If half this country believes the crisis has passed, we're going to have a lot more outbreaks.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":
