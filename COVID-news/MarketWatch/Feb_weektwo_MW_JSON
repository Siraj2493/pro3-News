Haoran is under the covers, fiddling with his Huawei phone. His girlfriend Sisi, in slippers and a robe, is sitting crosslegged on the floor, focused on her laptop.\n\nWhen asked what they are doing, they reply in unison: \"Working.\"\n\nChinese companies were supposed to be back to business this week. In fact, the original plan was to return to work after the weeklong Lunar New Year break -- China's biggest holiday -- which ended Jan. 30. But the coronavirus has changed all that.\n\nAuthorities now face a dilemma, with the need to tame the explosive epidemic, which has , versus getting the tiring engines of its economy revving again. China's economy grew at 6.1% last year, . No country wants slowing growth, particularly not one whose unelected government maintains legitimacy based largely on decades of rapid economic development.\n\nIts solution: to urge, and in some cities require, companies to advise their employees to work from home.\n\nOpinion:\n\nWhether this nationwide telecommuting experiment works may not be known from first-quarter economic data, which are . Nor from the fact that downloads of the country's leading workplace messaging apps have skyrocketed.\n\nRather, the compelling evidence is likely to lie in how much company leaders and managers change their minds about the idea, and either trust their teams to work from home going forward, or see that it hurt productivity.\n\nThough not unheard of in the country, . Nearly half of Americans report , with more than 5% -- or 8 million people -- in 2017. Over offer some form of telecommuting.\n\n\"In China, if the boss is paying you money, he wants to see you working in front of him,\" said Li Min, a self-employed writer in Chengdu who left an office job five years ago in part because of the lack of flexibility offered by management. \"If they pay you money, they buy you,\" she said.\n\nHad this epidemic disrupted China's economy for a few days or even a week, there may have been too little time for companies to observe how they function as a team while dispersed and out of the office. But this week marks the second week of government-advised telecommuting, and with the coronavirus death rate still rising, a third or more week is not unlikely.\n\nIn fact, many companies remained completely closed this week.\n\nWe surveyed 20 Chinese white-collar employees, and found that most had either been asked to work from home or had the entire week of work canceled (most with pay). Two of the 20 said they had the option to go in to their office but felt there was an implicit nudge from management to work from home. One said that management encouraged staff to work from home, but told them, \"If you want to work in the office this week then you must wear a mask while you're there.\"\n\nYears ago, as the internet gradually began taking a central role in white-collar jobs, there was debate over whether working from home was good or bad for productivity, morale and turnover. That debate seems settled, as mounting , more comfort and less commuting time for at-home employees.\n\nBut China may have a few years to go. For instance, in northern cities like Beijing, the government turns on public heating across the city in the winter. In Chengdu -- a city of 18 million -- with an average January low of 37 degrees, it doesn't quite make the cut for city-provided heating, and many residents are reluctant to spend money heating their homes themselves.\n\nThus Haoran and Sisi stay cooped up in their bedroom, with a small portable heater buzzing, while the rest of their apartment remains chilly. Their predicament is not unusual in the west and south of China. And it doesn't make for the coziest work experience in the winter months.\n\nWhen asked if they were glad to have this opportunity to telecommute, which they hadn't been afforded before, or whether they preferred being in the office, they again replied in unison: \"The office.\"\n\nTanner Brown is a contributor to Barron's and MarketWatch and producer of the Caixin-Sinica Business Brief podcast.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanner_brown@marketwatch.com", "name": "Tanner Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telecommuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chengdu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chengdu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megacity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Huawei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Chinese", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Min Chinese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White-collar worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarketWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MarketWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Home_Office", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Home Office", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work and Family", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 31}], "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-IA005_chengd_ZG_20200210150804.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 122}, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1442219275", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-10", "time": "12:26:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-10T12:26:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-10T12:26:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-futures-flat-as-investors-keep-eye-on-coronavirus-2020-02-10", "title": "U.S. stocks edge higher as investors look past coronavirus to solid corporate earnings", "body": "Stocks edged higher on Monday as Wall Street investors took heart in mostly solid U.S. fourth-quarter corporate earnings and looked beyond concerns about the coronavirus outbreak's potential disruption to supply chains.\n\nWhat are major indexes doing?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.17% rose 65 points to 29,169, a gain of 0.2%.

coronavirus tops 1,000, with few signs of slowing", "body": "Outbreak's persistence dims optimism that the worst has passed\n\nBEIJING -- China's daily death toll from new virus has topped 100 for the first time, with more than 1,000 total deaths recorded, the health ministry announced Tuesday, as the spread of the contagion shows little sign of abating while exacting an ever-rising cost.\n\nThough more offices and stores in China have reopened after the extended Lunar New Year break, many people appear to be staying home. Public health authorities are watching closely to see whether workers' returning to cities and business resuming worsens the spread of the virus.\n\nAnother 108 deaths were reported over the previous 24 hours, the National Health Commission said in a daily update. That increased the total to 1,016 deaths, well beyond the toll taken by the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS which comes from the same family of coronaviruses as the current deadly pathogen.\n\nNewly confirmed cases fell slightly to 2,478 from 3,062 the day before, bringing the total to 42,638 on the mainland, some of whom have since been cured and released from hospital.\n\nThe outbreak's persistence is dimming optimism that the near-quarantine of some 60 million people and other disease-control measures might be working.\n\nBritain, meanwhile, declared the virus a \"serious and imminent threat to public health\" and said it would forcibly detain infected people if necessary. France tested scores of children and their parents after five British tourists contracted the virus at a ski resort.\n\nThe director-general of the World Health Organization said that the agency is still unable to predict where the outbreak is heading but that he believes there is still an opportunity to contain it.\n\n\"In recent days, we have seen some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China, like the cases reported in France yesterday and the U.K. today,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"The detection of the small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire, but for now, it's only a spark.\"\n\nIn Beijing, there were few signs of activity. The capital's broad avenues were largely free of traffic, and thousands of rental bikes stood in long ranks with hardly a customer. Tourist attractions such as the Forbidden City remained closed, as did schools, and many people worked from home, hoping to avoid crowds.\n\nIris Ke, who works for an advertising company, said she plans to wait until next week to go back to the office.\n\n\"We just need to have a little more sense of self-protection,\" said Ke. \"Life goes on anyway. How come we stop going outside or stop working simply because of fear of disease? We can't do that.\"\n\nThose shops and restaurants that did open found few customers.\n\nAt the Sanyuanli market in Beijing, the stalls were stocked with pork, mutton, seafood and vegetables and shoppers wore face masks.\n\n\"The number of customers here is down a lot, maybe by more than half,\" said Liu Ying, who sells walnuts, cashews and other specialties. \"But you can see a lot of people calling in orders, so we're slowly getting busy again.\"\n\nThe Beijing city government told residential compounds in the capital to close their gates, check visitors for fever and record their identities. The government also warned people to strictly abide by regulations requiring wearing of masks in public and to avoid group activities.\n\nMore than 440 cases have been confirmed outside mainland China, including two deaths in Hong Kong and the Philippines.\n\nOf those, 135 are from a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama, near Tokyo. Japan's Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the government was considering testing everyone remaining on board of the 3,711 passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess, which would require them to remain aboard until results were available.\n\nBritain issued its \"imminent threat\" declaration after a British man who caught the virus in Singapore in January appeared linked to several other confirmed cases in Europe. Five Britons, including a 9-year-old boy, contracted the virus in the French Alpine ski town of Contamines-Montjoie after staying in the same chalet as the British man.\n\nJerome Salomon, head of France's national health agency, said 61 people including the boy's schoolmates were tested and proved negative for the virus.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Still, the key issue is how the various disruptions are expected to impact the company's financials in the current quarter and beyond.\n\nDon't miss:\n\nRaymond James analyst Aaron Kessler recently wrote that an \"extended outbreak\" could mean constrained logistics abilities for e-commerce companies in general, especially with the Hubei province locked down. In addition, he said that companies like Alibaba BABA, -0.35% could face possible manufacturing and delivery labor shortages since the break for Lunar New Year was extended.\n\n\"We would look for an update on the impact on e-commerce shopping activity,\" he continued.\n\nAlibaba's fiscal third-quarter report comes before the opening bell on Thursday.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect that Alibaba earned 15.83 Renminbi a share for the December quarter, or $2.27, up from RMB12.19, or $1.82, in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nRevenue: The FactSet consensus calls for RMB158.28 billion in fiscal third-quarter revenue, or $22.66 billion. A year ago, the company posted RMB117.28 billion or $17.47 billion, in sales.\n\nStock movement: Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares have gained following five the company's past 10 earnings reports, and they're up 29% over the past 12 months. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB, +0.74% has added 19% in that time. Of the 56 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Alibaba's shares, 54 have buy ratings and two have hold ratings.\n\nWhat else to watch for\n\nWhile investors will be eagerly looking to gauge the impact of the coronavirus on e-commerce spending, they already have some indications about what the environment was like in Alibaba's December quarter.\n\nInstinet analyst Jialong Shi flagged data from China's National Bureau of Statistics that indicated e-commerce sales in the country grew 18% on a year-over-year basis during December, which marked a slight slowdown from November. He calculates that China's e-commerce sales also slowed in the fourth quarter generally when compared with the third quarter, perhaps due to a warmer winter that meant more sluggish sales growth in apparel.\n\nRead:\n\nAs for Alibaba specifically, he kept a buy rating but wrote: \"We expect the combined CM (customer management) and commission revenue to grow 22% in 3QFY20F, vs the consensus forecast of 23%. The gap likely lies in our lower commission revenue growth forecast of 19% vs the Street's 22%, as we believe Alibaba likely subsidized its customers and merchants during the Double 11 promotion, leading to a wider gap in growth of commission revenue and Tmall's physical goods GMV from 2 percentage points in 2QFY20 to our estimated 5 percentage points in 3QFY20.\"\n\nAlibaba's investment spending is always an area of focus for Wall Street as the company continues to spend on emerging areas of the business, including its \"new retail\" concept that merges the offline and online shopping experiences. The company has signaled that it would be reinvesting profits into areas like logistics and globalization during the second half of the fiscal year.\n\n\"We would look for more color on key areas of investment and the pace of investment (we do not believe Alibaba was signaling a big change in pace of spend),\" wrote Raymond James' Kessler.\n\nSee also:\n\nHe'll also be watching for commentary on sales and marketing expenses and the company's strategies for driving more effective spending in this area. Kessler has a strong buy rating on the stock.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_bary@marketwatch.com", "name": "Emily Bary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alibaba Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FactSet", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FactSet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubei", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hubei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmall", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tmall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Globalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Technology_Vendors", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Technology Vendors", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Developers", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Developers", "wgt": 13}], "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-IA014_Alibab_ZG_20200210154727.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 13}, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 13, "relevance": 101}, {"uri": "1442754145", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-10", "time": "21:07:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-10T21:07:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-10T21:06:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sp-500-nasdaq-touch-records-as-stocks-close-higher-on-solid-earnings-2020-02-10", "title": "S&P 500, Nasdaq touch records as stocks close higher on solid earnings", "body": "U.S. stocks rose Monday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each posting a record finish, after a firm round of corporate earnings offset concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.

Watch crude oil prices", "body": "China is the world's largest oil importer, and reduced demand is a signal of an economic slowdown\n\nA lot of people are surprised at how fast the S&P 500 Index rebounded after the initial coronavirus scare while managing to eke out fresh all-time highs.\n\nBut what didn't rebound? Oil prices and Treasury yields, which are dangerously close to fresh 52-week lows. Both are extremely economically sensitive, and both indicate the coronavirus will cause economic harm around the world.\n\nQE, again\n\nTo be fair, there were reasons to be optimistic about stocks before the coronavirus epidemic hit the front pages. Earnings were about to re-accelerate after being mostly flat in 2019, economic statistics were improving and there was no sign of a recession coming, despite the record length of the economic expansion in the U.S. (For more, read: .\")\n\nBut if the economy is doing so well, why is the Federal Reserve going full pedal to the metal on its quantitative-easing operations? QE is like pouring electronic dollars into the banking system that can only be accessed by financial institutions. It's not the only reason for the present bid in the stock market, but it is a big reason (see ).\n\nThe coronavirus scare has somewhat abated, but I do not believe the official Chinese statistics on the number infected and the death toll from the epidemic. There was a massive movement of people out of Wuhan before the quarantine was imposed, including a lot of international travel because of the Chinese holidays. I suspect that the number infected as well as the death toll is significantly higher, which would explain the willingness of the Chinese government to accept only limited help from the U.S. and other governments.\n\nReal-time China indicator\n\nCrude oil CL.1, +0.84% has traded a few ticks below $50 a barrel over the past two weeks but managed to close above that key level most of the time. I think it will take out $50 soon enough and, at a minimum, head toward $42 and perhaps lower if the outbreak is not contained swiftly. China accounts for over 20% of global oil imports -- it's the biggest driver for oil's price. The second-largest crude oil importer is the U.S., at just over 13%.\n\nIt has to be mentioned that SARS, an epidemic in 2002-2003, did show up in China's economic numbers. It spread in the late-fall and winter months, but it fizzled by spring time. The Wuhan coronavirus seems to be spreading faster than SARS, but that doesn't mean it won't follow the same seasonal patterns. Still, with 400 million Chinese under quarantine, the hit to China's economy and the price of oil, it is only a matter of time.\n\nOne dangerous investment category is that of master limited partnerships (MLPs) in the energy sector in the U.S. They tend to lure a lot of retired investors with their very high distribution yields. Some of those investors think, erroneously, that those yields are safe if they come from pipelines or storage facilities. While I am sure they are safer in the aggregate than the distribution yields of MLPs that produce crude oil, I must mention that many saw distribution yield cuts in 2015 because U.S. shale oil production costs are much higher than those of conventional production.A rapidly falling oil price affects oil production volumes.\n\nCrude oil production first peaked at 9.626 million barrels per day in 2015. By the fall of 2016, it had declined to 8.553 million barrels per day. An 11% decline in volume from the 2015 high caused multiple distribution yield cuts as well as some bankruptcies in the MLP space. The same could happen again (see ).\n\nIf the price of crude oil does what it did in 2015 -- culminating in the January 2016 low of $26 per barrel -- there is substantial downside for the stocks of both integrated energy companies and the more leveraged oil service ones. Both categories were badly underperforming the stock market before the coronavirus hit, and they now seem to be ready to take another leg lower.\n\nThere is a secular decline in oil-service stocks that is rather appalling, as horizontal drilling methods allow for significantly more oil to be produced with much smaller numbers of rigs. The PHLX oil service Index OSX, -0.74% is nearly 50% below its early 2009 low, when the S&P 500 SPX, -0.09% hit 666, while the S&P 500 last week hit an all-time high of 3,348. The OSX index is better than 50% below its January 2016 low, when oil hit $26 (see ).\n\nA base-case target for crude oil is $40 in relatively short order, while the worst-case scenario is a repetition of what happened in 2015.\n\nWhat about Treasury bonds?\n\nTen-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.71% were yielding 1.59% at the end of last week, only 16 basis points above last summer's low of 1.43% and 28 basis points below its all-time intraday low of 1.31%. Depending on how bad this coronavirus scare gets, we may see an inverted yield curve, like we did last summer, as well as new 52-week lows or new all-time lows in Treasury bond yields. Those are completely within reach (see ).\n\nFor now, an inverted Treasury yield curve should be viewed as a temporary scare and not a sign of a coming recession, if the corona virus follows the 2002-2003 SARS spreading pattern. It's too early to call for negative Treasury yields in the U.S., as they are primarily a function of European Central Bank policy. But some day, we may see U.S. Treasury yields in negative territory because of the willingness of the Federal Reserve to employ unorthodox monetary policy tools in times of crisis. Still, if negative interest rates did not help much in Europe or Japan -- and decimated their banking systems as net interest margins contracted -- why would they help here?\n\nIvan Martchev is an

back to the economic implications of the disease, buttressing bullion prices.\n\n\"There is still a thick smog of uncertainty over the outbreak and impacts it will have on China and global economy,\" said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM. \"Caution remains a major theme.\"\n\nChinese health officials changed the method of diagnosing cases of the illness, which has been officially named COVID-19. As a result, there was a of new cases of COVID-19, the new coronavirus illness that was first identified in December in Wuhan, China, based on a new diagnostic protocol, according to China's National Health Commission.\n\nGold for April delivery GCJ20, +0.51% on Comex rose $7.20, or 0.5%, to settle at $1,578.80 an ounce.
