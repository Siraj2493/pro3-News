Already, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has advised residents to cover their faces before heading outside.\n\nBut N95 masks, which are tighter-fitting than surgical masks and offer the most protection from viruses similar to coronavirus, are in short supply, even for health-care workers. Even flimsier disposable masks can be hard to find.\n\nDispatches from a pandemic:\n\nHere's what you need to know about DIY masks:\n\n*\u2009These masks aren't going to fully protect you from coronavirus. You should still be practicing social distancing by staying at least 6 feet away from others in public and frequently washing your hands for 20 seconds each time.\n\nDon't \"get an artificial sense of protection\", Deborah Birx, a public-health expert on the White House's coronavirus response team, said Thursday. \"Remember, your eyes are not in the mask, so if you're touching things and then touching your eyes, you're exposing yourself in the same way.\"\n\n*\u2009A DIY mask, while not as effective as an N95 mask, still offers some protection from respiratory droplets that spread the virus.\n\n*\u2009Fabric that is 100% cotton is comparable to surgical masks in effectiveness.\n\n*\u2009If you can't make your own mask, the New York City Department suggests covering your mouth and nose with a scarf or bandanna.\n\nWhile the internet is full of suggestions on how to make your own mask (hey, A !), Christian Schrock, an infectious disease doctor based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, says this version simulates a surgical mask and doesn't require sewing skills or glue.\n\n\"All masks are not created equally,\" Schrock told MarketWatch. \"There are 100's of DIY designs out there that do help somewhat to reduce the spread of the virus from the person who is not ill but still highly contagious.\"\n\n\"However this mask since it is comparable to some surgical masks offers reasonable protection for the wearer of the mask. It's not an N95 or better and is not 100% protective,\" he added.\n\nHere's what you need to make that mask in 10 minutes -- no sewing skills (or even a stapler) needed:\n\n*\u2009Clean flat bed sheet with side hems (100% cotton, tight weave)\n\n*\u2009Scissors\n\n*\u2009Measuring tape (or 8.5'\" x 11\" piece of paper to approximate)\n\n*\u2009Large paper clip (or other malleable metal strip like floral wire or pipe cleaner) to make the nose pinch.\n\n*\u2009Safety pins (or stapler)\n\nYour finished mask should look like this:\n\nYou can reuse the mask. Place it in boiling water for five minutes.

all Americans be wearing face masks to protect against coronavirus? The CDC now says yes", "body": "Trump indicates that nationwide recommendation on wearing face masks will be coming soon\n\nBack when there were only few confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Surgeon General all pled with the public urging them unless they were sick or caring for someone who was sick.\n\nOn Friday, President Donald Trump announced that \"CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth faced covering as an additional voluntary public health measure.\" Trump himself said he does not plan on wearing a face mask.\n\n\"If you do choose to wear a face mask, wash your hands first,\" said U.S. Surgeon General, Jerome Adams. He also cautioned not to touch your face while wearing a mask.\n\n\"The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N95 respirators,\" Adams added. \"Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders.\"\n\nThe guidance on face masks has not yet been posted on the CDC's site, who did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment.\n\n\"The most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hands, and we don't want people to get an artificial sense of protection, because they're behind a mask,\" Dr. Deborah Birx, a public health expert on the White House's coronavirus response team, said during Thursday's briefing ahead of the CDC's recommendation.\n\n\"Remember, your eyes are not in the mask, so if you're touching things and then touching your eyes you're exposing yourself in the same way.\"\n\nToday, there are 270,473 of cases of COVID-19 across America as of Friday -- over 51,000 in New York City alone and nearly 93,000 in New York State. Prior to Friday's announcement New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to cover their faces before heading outside.\n\n\"People who do not show symptoms may still be able to spread COVID-19. A face covering can help prevent you from spreading COVID-19 to other people, so you should wear one whenever you leave the home,\" the New York City Department of Health said in an . \"A face covering will not protect you from infection, but it can help others.\"\n\nDispatches from a pandemic:\n\nThis comes amid a growing movement to encourage mask usage in the U.S., even as health-care professionals grapple a severe shortage of protective equipment, including face masks and gowns as they treat coronavirus patients.\n\nOn social media, the #Masks4All campaign was started by Jeremy Howard, a distinguished research scientist at the University of San Francisco and a member of the World Economic Forum's Global AI Council. The #Masks4All movement doesn't just push for people to wear masks, but also to make their own face masks at home to ensure that health-care workers have access to supplies.\n\nIn an for the Washington Post, Howard said, \"The senseless and unscientific push for the general public to avoid wearing masks\" should rank among the worst missteps made by policy makers.\n\nThat perspective was echoed by George Gao, director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in an .\n\n\"The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren't wearing masks,\" Gao said.\n\n\"This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important role -- you've got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth,\" Gao continued. \"Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others.\"\n\nThe Moneyist:\n\nMultiple studies have indicated that people may display few symptoms but have the coronavirus, while others may be contagious before they begin to display symptoms. These asymptomatic individuals have complicated government efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus across the globe.\n\nSome previous research has concluded that face masks have helped by reducing droplets being sprayed into the air; another Japanese-based study says this works when paired with vaccination, not an option in this case. says N95 medical-grade masks do help filter viruses that are larger than 0.1 micrometers (One micrometer, um, is one millionth of a meter.) The coronavirus is 0.125 um.\n\nProponents of face masks also point to the anecdotal evidence from countries in East and Southeast Asia, including South Korea and Taiwan, that have been able to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus and flatten the curve more effectively than in countries like the U.S., Spain and Italy.\n\nMask usage is more ubiquitous in these countries in general as a hygienic practice even outside of instances of global disease outbreaks. \"In all of these countries, all of which were hit hard by the SARS respiratory virus outbreak in 2002 and 2003, everyone is wearing masks in public,\" Howard wrote.\n\nRecently, some Western countries have required residents to wear face masks. The Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bosnia-Herzegovina now , while nearby Austria\n\nKK Cheng, a public-health expert and professor at the University of Birmingham in the U.K, said he wears a mask when he goes to the supermarket and supports Austria's decision to mandate masks there.\n\n\"I think it's a good idea because trips to the supermarket are the main exposure to the virus,\" especially in areas where they are the only businesses that are open, he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the CDC continue to stand by their recommendations from earlier in the coronavirus outbreak. They argue that mask usage should be limited to people who have COVID-19 or may have contracted the illness and their caregivers, including health-care workers.\n\n\" 'There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any particular benefit.' \"\n\n-- Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's top emergencies expert\n\n\"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any particular benefit,\" Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO's top emergencies expert, said during a press conference Monday.\n\nSimilarly, the CDC still \"does not recommend that people who are well wear a face mask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.\"\n\n\"You should only wear a mask if a health-care professional recommends it,\" the \"A face mask should be used by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms. This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected.\"\n\nBut in a published in The Lancet, a medical publication, a group of researchers from Hong Kong argued that the lack of studies proving masks to be effective didn't mean they weren't.\n\n\"There is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence,\" they wrote. \"Face masks are widely used by medical workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections. It would be reasonable to suggest vulnerable individuals avoid crowded areas and use surgical face masks rationally when exposed to high-risk areas.\"\n\nWhile face masks may help protect people, they are hard to come by\n\nIn many countries, including the U.S., a shortage of masks has endangered doctors and nurses treating patients with COVID-19. Health-care professionals have warned that they may need to reuse masks as a result, which can reduce their effectiveness. Multiple in making masks to combat this shortage.\n\n\"We have a massive global shortage,\" Ryan said. \"Right now, the people most at risk from this virus are frontline health workers who are exposed to the virus, every second of every day. The thought of them not having masks is horrific. So we have to be very careful.\"\n\nA spokesman for the CDC noted that officials could reserve face masks for health-care workers, meaning they are less likely to be available for non-health care. \"You may need to improvise a face mask using a scarf or bandana,\" which was last updated on March 25. (Balaclavas may also provide some protection.)\n\nDr. Christian Schrock, an infectious disease doctor based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, set up . You can also a watch a based on his mask design methodology on YouTube.\n\nN95 masks, however, are tighter-fitting than surgical masks and protect against small particles and large droplets, according to the . These types of masks offer the most protection from viruses similar to coronavirus.\n\nFor health-care professionals who cannot be six feet apart from patients with COVID-19, there are few substitutes to N95 masks. Surgical masks, the CDC says, should be worn if N95 masks are \"so limited that routinely practiced standards of care for wearing N95 respirators and equivalent or higher level of protection respirators are no longer possible.\"\n\nAs a last resort if both surgical and N95 masks aren't available, the CDC says it \"may be necessary\" for them to use homemade masks that haven't been approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nProponents of face-mask usage have suggested that people fashion their own protective gear. \"A homemade DIY mask would be better than nothing,\" in terms of limiting transmission of coronavirus, Cheng said.\n\nIt's not clear whether people making masks at home should choose certain materials over others. \"If the WHO and other authorities think it's a good thing for the public to wear masks,\" Cheng said health authorities around the world would likely investigate which materials offer the best protection for a DIY mask.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elisabeth_buchwald@marketwatch.com", "name": "Elisabeth Buchwald", "type": "author",

Gov. Cuomo and Dr. Fauci are America's de facto leaders during the coronavirus pandemic", "body": "For Americans gripped with fear and confusion over the rapid spread of the coronavirus, Cuomo and Fauci have emerged as unexpected emotional life rafts\n\nThroughout the month of March, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has held near-daily news conferences updating New Yorkers with dire statistics on ventilators and hospital beds. In response, #PresidentCuomo has trended on Twitter, and the governor's updates are as \",\" even by users who .\n\nMeanwhile, a Twitter user in Rochester, New York, recently posted a photo of doughnuts decorated with photos of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who earlier in the day made what would otherwise be an improbable appearance in an Instagram Live Q&A with .\n\nFor Americans gripped with fear and confusion over the rapid spread of the coronavirus, Cuomo and Fauci have emerged as unexpected emotional life rafts. For many, they've also become primary sources of information on the pandemic -- from Business Insider listed both men as the most trusted leaders in the U.S. when it comes to the coronavirus response. For Cuomo in particular, there's been so much \"glowing coverage\" that even the . More recently, a poll from the Siena College Research Institute found that of his handling of the epidemic.\n\nHere's how a previously little-known infectious disease expert and a state governor who'd spent the past year battling wound up as many Americans' de facto leaders in the face of an unprecedented threat.\n\nThey state the facts clearly\n\nThe coronavirus has been plagued by the spread of false or confusing information -- much of it coming from the . Questionable text-message forwards with information \"from a friend who's a doctor\" are being swapped back and forth, while social media networks are battling an .\n\nPerhaps it's not especially shocking, then, that two figures regularly offering up vetted, clear, and understandable information have become such lifelines in this crisis.\n\nFauci and Cuomo \"are blunt explainers of facts,\" said Joel Garfinkle, an executive coach and author of \"Executive Presence: Convey Confidence and Command Respect as a Leader.\" \"There's no nonsense. They're clear with the statistics, [and giving] short, pithy statements that really grab people's attention.\"\n\nIn Cuomo's case, daily news conferences include concise powerpoint slides that are easily screenshotted and shared on social media. And Fauci has been able to distill complex, shifting medical data into understandable statements, garnering praise from Scientific American as a \"plain spoken\" example of how a scientific expert should communicate with the public.\n\n\"They are clear; they provide facts,\" said Kim Scott, author of the bestselling management guide \"Radical Candor\" and a Silicon Valley veteran who has led teams at Google, developed management strategies at Apple, and acted as a CEO coach at companies including Dropbox and Twitter. \"Here's what has been done, what the problems are, and what needs to be done.\"\n\nThey know that honest bad news is better than dishonest good news\n\nClear as the data coming from Fauci and Cuomo may be, it's also often devastating. (Earlier this month Fauci said of the government's testing system, \"It's failing, let's admit it.\") This hasn't stopped Fauci from being lauded as an \"American hero,\" or Cuomo from turning bleak daily news briefings into appointment viewing.\n\n\"People can deal with the facts, and people have a hard time dealing with uncertainty,\" Scott said. \"When someone is clearly lying, it's more stressful than the news itself.\"\n\nSimilar to the experience of a patient awaiting grim medical news, Scott said, \"The worst part of that experience is waiting to get an exact diagnosis and a plan. No matter how horrible the plan is, when they have it, they feel better.\"\n\nAnd in fact, both Fauci and Cuomo's ongoing willingness to be the bearers of bad news -- most recently, Fauci's warning that the U.S. death toll could reach 200,000 -- has likely bolstered the public's sense of comfort with them, rather than diminished it.\n\nAs a leader, \"Don't sugarcoat the truth,\" said Jennifer Goldman-Wetzler, Ph.D., executive coach, and author of \"Optimal Outcomes: Free Yourself From Conflict at Work, at Home, and in Life.\" \"When you do that, people find out, and you've lost trust.\"\n\nIn addition to supporting their own credibility as reliable sources of information, both Fauci and Cuomo may be providing some degree of calm. \"Even when the truth is terrible, we imagine that it's even worse,\" Scott said. \"Having the facts is actually comforting.\"\n\nThey make an emotional connection with people\n\nAround the same time that some politicians and social media users were starting to make the argument that a higher coronavirus death rate may be a necessary sacrifice to make for the health of the economy, Cuomo got nearly 74,000 retweets and 285,000 likes on a tweet stating, \"My mother is not expendable. Your mother is not expendable. We will not put a dollar figure on human life.\"\n\nRather than staying above the fray of a widespread societal panic, statements like this have allowed Cuomo to maintain a level of emotional relatability that makes people feel seen.\n\n\"He's tapping into certain emotions that we're all already feeling and using those to connect with people,\" Goldman-Wetzler said.\n\nAnd this level of emotional identification with a leader can create a broader sense of trust in their practical handling of the situation. \"Cuomo is speaking from a place that people can relate to, and feel like he gets it and he has our back\" Garfinkle said. \"Part of that is the ability to really connect and be with [your] audience. What's it like to be a person receiving this information? And how do I communicate it?\"\n\n\"You never get the sense that either [Cuomo or Fauci] is impervious to the human toll that this is taking on people,\" Scott said.\n\nThey put politics to the side (somewhat)\n\nAfter Hurricane Sandy ravaged his state in 2012, then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, reached out directly to President Obama for assistance and toured storm damage with the Democratic leader. In response, his approval ratings spiked from 56% to 77%.\n\nIn the midst of a crisis, the sense that a leader is willing to cut through red tape or put aside political protocol can be a powerful way of building credibility.\n\nFauci, in particular, first gained attention for his willingness to contradict and correct information coming from the White House. At the same time, he's also thrown support behind the president on issues such as the initial European travel ban, eschewing partisanship for support of scientific facts.\n\nCuomo has alternately worked closely with and publicly chided the president in his efforts to bring aid to New York state, while simultaneously working to relax regulations to allow more medical workers to come into service; getting federal permission to launch testing with private labs; asking for aid from other states in exchange for help from New York in the future; and other actions that signal a willingness to work around business as usual. One result of this has been a sudden spike in discussion on social media (and from Fox News host Tucker Carlson) of a last-minute Cuomo presidential run, though experts and political operatives view this scenario as unlikely. In response to President Trump's recent comments about an election matchup between the two of them, Cuomo said in his daily news conference on Monday that he wasn't interested in \"engaging in politics with the president\" and \"I'm not running for president, I was never running for president. I said from day one I'm not running for president, I'm not running for president now.\"\n\n\"There's no facade of politically minded language,\" Garfinkle said. \"Both Cuomo and Fauci have shown examples of standing up for what they believe in and not backing down. The distinction from a leadership standpoint is that people feel 'They're out there for me.'\"\n\nThe importance of just showing up\n\nJust as Christie saw a rush of popularity for his handling of Hurricane Sandy, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani rode a years-long wave of goodwill as \"America's Mayor\" for his response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. His Time \"Person of the Year' profile in 2001 described in grisly detail his visits to Ground Zero shortly after the attacks, at a time when other public officials were far less visible.\n\nEven when public appearances don't carry as clear or visible an element of physical risk, they can provide an anchoring force in a crisis.\n\n\"Cuomo in particular is just present,\" Goldman-Wetzler said. \"Why are we suddenly paying attention to him? Because he's there. Every hour he's posting on Twitter, he's making speeches, he's just showing up.\"\n\nIn other words, even upsetting daily news conferences, to many viewers, are vastly preferable to an upsetting lack of daily press conferences. \"When a leader is aware of that and shows up it's comforting. It almost matters less what they say and what they do, it matters more that they're there,\" Ms. Goldman-Wetzler said.\n\nIt's not surprising, then, that Fauci's absence from a recent White House press briefing led to immediate worried headlines about his \"disappearance.\"\n\nFrightened citizens who have come to depend on either Fauci or Cuomo as their sources of comfort or information, then, are likely to want their continued public presence until the crisis comes to an end. \"Every step of the way, they both are telling the truth, they show up, they're building trust with the American people,\" Goldman-Wetzler said. \"And when you have people's trust, whether you tell them 'it's safe to go outside now' or 'you actually still need to stay inside,' they believe you.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "virginia_k_smith@marketwatch.com", "name": "Virginia K.

"Receiving Social Security disability benefits? Living abroad? How much  --  if any  --  of the $1,200 checks Americans in special situations will get", "body": "Many Americans are getting ready to receive checks as part of the government's $2 trillion stimulus package, but some are unsure if they qualify -- or how much they'll receive -- if they have unique circumstances, such as claiming Social Security disability benefits or earning much less income this year than last year.\n\nThe president signed Congress' stimulus package into law in response to the financial crisis looming as a result of the spreading coronavirus. The United States is currently the country from the disease, with more than 144,000 confirmed cases and 2,500 deaths. Approximately 4,800 people have recovered so far.\n\nState and local officials have enacted lockdowns across the country, which have required nonessential workers -- including many of those in retail and entertainment -- to stay home. Restaurants across the U.S. have been told to restrict their customers to only take-out or delivery, and other establishments are limiting the number of customers they will allow into their stores at a time. A record 3.28 million people applied for unemployment benefits and major stock indexes have been a roller coaster of volatility the last month, ending the nearly 11-year SPX, -1.51%.\n\nOne provision of the includes sending out checks of up to $1,200 per individual to qualifying Americans, in an attempt to ease the financial burdens they may face because of this crisis. Taxpayers earning $75,000 or less will receive the full $1,200, and the check amount will decrease $5 for every $100 between that threshold and $99,000. who are married filing jointly will receive $2,400 if they earn $150,000 or less, and those checks will be phased out up to the maximum of $198,000. Heads of household will qualify if they earn $112,500 or less, up until the cap at $146,500. Americans will receive $500 for every child under age 17.\n\nRecipients of Supplemental Security Income are also eligible for the checks.\n\nTo be eligible, people cannot be nonresident alien individuals, must have a Social Security number and cannot be claimed as dependents by someone else, according to the . Their check amounts will depend on 2019 tax returns, or 2018 if last year's return has not yet been filed. (The deadline to file 2019 returns has been pushed to , 2020).\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service said on Monday people who do not typically file tax returns will need to file a simple return to receive the check, but will not owe tax. This includes low-income taxpayers, senior citizens, Social Security recipients, some veterans and individuals with disabilities, . The rebate checks are nontaxable.\n\nSee:\n\nHere are some of the questions MarketWatch readers asked, and the answers available so far:\n\nQuestion: I receive Social Security but live abroad. Will I get a check?\n\nAnswer: Presumably, yes, retirees who live abroad but collect Social Security will receive a check, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. A majority of Social Security beneficiaries living overseas get their benefits electronically with direct deposit, so they should receive the stimulus money in the same way.\n\nQuestion: I receive Workers' Compensation. Will I get a check?\n\nAnswer: There are no requirements about the source of income, so someone receiving Workers' Compensation will still be eligible for rebate checks so long as they are U.S. citizens, have a Social Security number and earn less than the income limits, said Jamie Hopkins, director of retirement research at Carson Group.\n\nQuestion: I receive Social Security disability benefits. Will I get a check?\n\nAnswer: Yes. Any taxpayers are eligible, regardless what type of benefit they receive from the Social Security Administration, so long as they are meet the requirements.\n\nQuestion: I collect back pay from Social Security disability benefits, which pushes my adjusted gross income above the threshold. How will the government calculate that figure?\n\nAnswer: As it stands, the bill's language dictates only taxpayers who meet the income limits will qualify for a check, no matter the reason why their adjusted gross income is above the threshold.\n\nQuestion: I earned much more in 2018 or 2019 than I do in 2020, in which I would qualify for some or all of the full check amount. How can I get the amount I'm owed for my situation right now?\n\nAnswer: The package provides no guidance as to how the Treasury Department will sort through these scenarios yet. According to the bill's language, only taxpayers who meet the income requirements will qualify for a check. It is possible the government will set up a special request program as the year goes on, Hopkins said. Some taxpayers may have to wait to clear up this issue next year when they file a tax return in 2020, in which case they would receive a credit for the rebate check, he added.\n\nQuestion: Do disabled adults get any check if another taxpayer claims them as a dependent?\n\nAnswer: No, individuals must not be claimed as dependents by another taxpayer to be eligible. Individuals will receive $500 for each child under 17 who they claim.\n\nAlso see:\n\nQuestion: I haven't filed my taxes in the last couple of years and I don't claim Social Security. How will the government know I exist if I qualify for a check?\n\nAnswer: Eligible individuals will need to file a simple return in order to receive the checks. The Treasury Department is creating a web-based portal for people to input their banking information for the IRS will use so that individuals can receive payments immediately, the agency said. They will need to include their filing status, number of dependents and bank account information for direct deposits. Those who are not typically required to file a tax return will not owe tax for sending in a return. More information will be available at a later time on the for coronavirus updates.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Americans will receive $500 for every child under age 17.\n\nRecipients of Supplemental Security Income are also eligible for the checks.\n\nTaxpayers must be a U.S. citizen, have a Social Security number and cannot be claimed as dependents by someone else. Their check amounts will depend on 2019 tax returns, or 2018 if last year's return has not yet been filed. (The deadline to file 2019 returns has been pushed to , 2020). The government will use information from Social Security benefit statements if an individual has not filed a tax return in the last few years. The rebate checks are nontaxable.\n\nSee:\n\nHere are some of the questions MarketWatch readers asked, and the answers available so far:\n\nQuestion: I receive Social Security but live abroad. Will I get a check?\n\nAnswer: Presumably, yes, retirees who live abroad but collect Social Security will receive a check, said Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. A majority of Social Security beneficiaries living overseas get their benefits electronically with direct deposit, so they should receive the stimulus money in the same way.\n\nQuestion: I receive Workers' Compensation. Will I get a check?\n\nAnswer: There are no requirements about the source of income, so someone receiving Workers' Compensation will still be eligible for rebate checks so long as they are U.S. citizens, have a Social Security number and earn less than the income limits, said Jamie Hopkins, director of retirement research at Carson Group.\n\nQuestion: I receive Social Security disability benefits. Will I get a check?\n\nAnswer: Yes. Any taxpayers are eligible, regardless what type of benefit they receive from the Social Security Administration, so long as they meet the income requirements.\n\nQuestion: I collect back pay from Social Security disability benefits, which pushes my adjusted gross income above the threshold. How will the government calculate that figure?\n\nAnswer: As it stands, the bill's language dictates only taxpayers who meet the income limits will qualify for a check, no matter the reason why their adjusted gross income is above the threshold.\n\nQuestion: I earned much more in 2018 or 2019 than I do in 2020, in which I would qualify for some or all of the full check amount. How can I get the amount I'm owed for my situation right now?\n\nAnswer: The package provides no guidance as to how the Treasury Department will sort through these scenarios yet. According to the bill's language, only taxpayers who meet the income requirements will qualify for a check. It is possible the government will set up a special request program as the year goes on, Hopkins said. Some taxpayers may have to wait to clear up this issue next year when they file a tax return in 2020, in which case they would receive a credit for the rebate check, he added.\n\nQuestion: Do disabled adults get any check if another taxpayer claims them as a dependent?\n\nAnswer: No, individuals must not be claimed as dependents by another taxpayer to be eligible. Individuals will receive $500 for each child under 17 who they claim.\n\nAlso see:\n\nQuestion: I haven't filed my taxes in the last couple of years and I don't claim Social Security. How will the government know I exist if I qualify for a check?\n\nAnswer: There's no clear answer as to how the government will find individuals who have not filed taxes or do not claim Social Security yet, experts said.\n\nSome Americans may want to file a return for 2019 to assist the government in finding them, though there is also no set deadline for when it would need to receive the return to process the check. All checks are expected to be sent, either as a direct deposit or in the mail, within three weeks.\n\nThe IRS created a page on its site dedicated to updates on rebate checks, which you can find . \"Finding people who don't pay taxes will be a challenge but they are still entitled to the rebate if they meet the other requirements,\" Hopkins said.", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com",

program \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nThat solution? Universal testing.\n\nBullard laid out a system where every American would be tested every day and would wear a badge with their negative result, similar to the ones people wear after they vote.\n\nThis would help the economy because people \"could interact with each other with a lot of confidence,\" he said. And the health-care sector would be able to bring care quickly to those in need.\n\nLast month, Bullard made headlines for publishing research suggesting\n\nDuring his CBS interview on Sunday, Bullard repeated that the coronavirus-era job losses shouldn't be compared with those during any past economic recession because it is the result of a request from the federal government: Stay home to invest in the health of the country.\n\n\"In principal, this is an understandable situation. We do not want people to go back to the basketball games. We do not want people to get on planes while this disease is ravaging the economy,\" he said.\n\nRead:\n\nis good news in the sense that Americans will get the government transfer payments they need, he added,\n\nMost of the impact of the shutdown in economic activity will be felt in the second quarter, Bullard said.\n\nThe third legislative relief package passed by Congress, estimated to allocate around $2.5 trillion in new spending, is about the right size to assist Americans who have lost jobs and income, Bullard said. The challenge now is to get that assistance into the right hands.\n\nU.S. equity benchmarks show how concerned investors are about the outlook.

record,' says BofA analysts, as jobless claims surge to 6.6 million", "body": "There are no parallels for the pandemic fueled slowdown that the U.S. economy is currently contending with, and that is forcing economists like those of Bank of America Global Research to forecast a decidedly grimmer outlook for the American economy than they offered just two weeks ago.\n\nThe BofA researchers on Thursday said the coming recession \"appears to be deeper and more prolonged than we were led to believe just 14 days ago when we last updated our forecasts, not just in the US but globally as well.\"\n\nThe April 2 research report, which includes star economist Michelle Meyer, comes as the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits last week soared by a record 6.6 million, bringing the increase in new jobless claims in the last two weeks of March to 10 million.\n\nAs the scale of the shutdowns of business in force, intended to help mitigate the spread of the deadly pathogen, is unprecedented and is having a substantial negative impact on the labor market and the broader economy.\n\nTo that end, BofA sees between 16 and 20 million job losses, which could send the unemployment rate, which stands at 3.5% as of February's report, surging within a few months to 15.6%, which would by far outstrip the unemployment rate during the 2007-09 recession.\n\nA report on U.S. nonfarm payrolls will be released on Friday, because of when that data was recorded, just before the worst of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe BofA team forecast three consecutive quarters of contraction in gross domestic product, \"with the US economy shrinking 7% (annualized) in 1Q, 30% in 2Q and 1% in 3Q.\"\n\nOn the bright side, the economists estimate that the fourth quarter of 2020 will see a sizable pop in business activity as the measures put in place to slow the deadly contagion are slowly unwound.\n\nThat said, the cumulative decline in economic expansion will be severe: \"We forecast the cumulative decline in GDP to be 10.4% and this will be the deepest recession on record, nearly five times more severe than the post-war average,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nWhy are the researchers predicting \"a recession unlike any other,\" as they describe in their report, despite the Federal Reserve's of the financial market and a as well as that was signed into law on Friday by President Donald Trump?\n\nThe analysts say that while they expect the consumer spending to eventually return, turning positive in the third quarter, they anticipate \"further contraction in business and residential investment.\"\n\n\"We also think there will be additional inventory contraction given impaired supply chains and frictions in production,\" BofA wrote.\n\nWhile consumer spending will likely turn positive in 3Q as the economy slowly opens, they still see weakness in the consumer \"as they face job cuts and a significant negative wealth shock,\" they wrote\n\n\"This naturally leads

Cuomo and Dr. Fauci are America's de facto leaders during the coronavirus pandemic", "body": "For Americans gripped with fear and confusion over the rapid spread of the coronavirus, Cuomo and Fauci have emerged as unexpected emotional life rafts\n\nThroughout the month of March, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has held near-daily news conferences updating New Yorkers with dire statistics on ventilators and hospital beds. In response, #PresidentCuomo has trended on Twitter, and the governor's updates are as \",\" even by users who .\n\nMeanwhile, a Twitter user in Rochester, New York, recently posted a photo of doughnuts decorated with photos of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who earlier in the day made what would otherwise be an improbable appearance in an Instagram Live Q&A with .\n\nFor Americans gripped with fear and confusion over the rapid spread of the coronavirus, Cuomo and Fauci have emerged as unexpected emotional life rafts. For many, they've also become primary sources of information on the pandemic -- from Business Insider listed both men as the most trusted leaders in the U.S. when it comes to the coronavirus response. For Cuomo in particular, there's been so much \"glowing coverage\" that even the . More recently, a poll from the Siena College Research Institute found that of his handling of the epidemic.\n\nHere's how a previously little-known infectious disease expert and a state governor who'd spent the past year battling wound up as many Americans' de facto leaders in the face of an unprecedented threat.\n\nThey state the facts clearly\n\nThe coronavirus has been plagued by the spread of false or confusing information -- much of it coming from the . Questionable text-message forwards with information \"from a friend who's a doctor\" are being swapped back and forth, while social media networks are battling an .\n\nPerhaps it's not especially shocking, then, that two figures regularly offering up vetted, clear, and understandable information have become such lifelines in this crisis.\n\nFauci and Cuomo \"are blunt explainers of facts,\" said Joel Garfinkle, an executive coach and author of \"Executive Presence: Convey Confidence and Command Respect as a Leader.\" \"There's no nonsense. They're clear with the statistics, [and giving] short, pithy statements that really grab people's attention.\"\n\nIn Cuomo's case, daily news conferences include concise powerpoint slides that are easily screenshotted and shared on social media. And Fauci has been able to distill complex, shifting medical data into understandable statements, garnering praise from Scientific American as a \"plain spoken\" example of how a scientific expert should communicate with the public.\n\n\"They are clear; they provide facts,\" said Kim Scott, author of the bestselling management guide \"Radical Candor\" and a Silicon Valley veteran who has led teams at Google, developed management strategies at Apple, and acted as a CEO coach at companies including Dropbox and Twitter. \"Here's what has been done, what the problems are, and what needs to be done.\"\n\nThey know that honest bad news is better than dishonest good news\n\nClear as the data coming from Fauci and Cuomo may be, it's also often devastating. (Earlier this month Fauci said of the government's testing system, \"It's failing, let's admit it.\") This hasn't stopped Fauci from being lauded as an \"American hero,\" or Cuomo from turning bleak daily news briefings into appointment viewing.\n\n\"People can deal with the facts, and people have a hard time dealing with uncertainty,\" Scott said. \"When someone is clearly lying, it's more stressful than the news itself.\"\n\nSimilar to the experience of a patient awaiting grim medical news, Scott said, \"The worst part of that experience is waiting to get an exact diagnosis and a plan. No matter how horrible the plan is, when they have it, they feel better.\"\n\nAnd in fact, both Fauci and Cuomo's ongoing willingness to be the bearers of bad news -- most recently, Fauci's warning that the U.S. death toll could reach 200,000 -- has likely bolstered the public's sense of comfort with them, rather than diminished it.\n\nAs a leader, \"Don't sugarcoat the truth,\" said Jennifer Goldman-Wetzler, Ph.D., executive coach, and author of \"Optimal Outcomes: Free Yourself From Conflict at Work, at Home, and in Life.\" \"When you do that, people find out, and you've lost trust.\"\n\nIn addition to supporting their own credibility as reliable sources of information, both Fauci and Cuomo may be providing some degree of calm. \"Even when the truth is terrible, we imagine that it's even worse,\" Scott said. \"Having the facts is actually comforting.\"\n\nThey make an emotional connection with people\n\nAround the same time that some politicians and social media users were starting to make the argument that a higher coronavirus death rate may be a necessary sacrifice to make for the health of the economy, Cuomo got nearly 74,000 retweets and 285,000 likes on a tweet stating, \"My mother is not expendable. Your mother is not expendable. We will not put a dollar figure on human life.\"\n\nRather than staying above the fray of a widespread societal panic, statements like this have allowed Cuomo to maintain a level of emotional relatability that makes people feel seen.\n\n\"He's tapping into certain emotions that we're all already feeling and using those to connect with people,\" Goldman-Wetzler said.\n\nAnd this level of emotional identification with a leader can create a broader sense of trust in their practical handling of the situation. \"Cuomo is speaking from a place that people can relate to, and feel like he gets it and he has our back\" Garfinkle said. \"Part of that is the ability to really connect and be with [your] audience. What's it like to be a person receiving this information? And how do I communicate it?\"\n\n\"You never get the sense that either [Cuomo or Fauci] is impervious to the human toll that this is taking on people,\" Scott said.\n\nThey put politics to the side (somewhat)\n\nAfter Hurricane Sandy ravaged his state in 2012, then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, reached out directly to President Obama for assistance and toured storm damage with the Democratic leader. In response, his approval ratings spiked from 56% to 77%.\n\nIn the midst of a crisis, the sense that a leader is willing to cut through red tape or put aside political protocol can be a powerful way of building credibility.\n\nFauci, in particular, first gained attention for his willingness to contradict and correct information coming from the White House. At the same time, he's also thrown support behind the president on issues such as the initial European travel ban, eschewing partisanship for support of scientific facts.\n\nCuomo has alternately worked closely with and publicly chided the president in his efforts to bring aid to New York state, while simultaneously working to relax regulations to allow more medical workers to come into service; getting federal permission to launch testing with private labs; asking for aid from other states in exchange for help from New York in the future; and other actions that signal a willingness to work around business as usual. One result of this has been a sudden spike in discussion on social media (and from Fox News host Tucker Carlson) of a last-minute Cuomo presidential run, though experts and political operatives view this scenario as unlikely. In response to President Trump's recent comments about an election matchup between the two of them, Cuomo said in his daily news conference on Monday that he wasn't interested in \"engaging in politics with the president\" and \"I'm not running for president, I was never running for president. I said from day one I'm not running for president, I'm not running for president now.\"\n\n\"There's no facade of politically minded language,\" Garfinkle said. \"Both Cuomo and Fauci have shown examples of standing up for what they believe in and not backing down. The distinction from a leadership standpoint is that people feel 'They're out there for me.'\"\n\nThe importance of just showing up\n\nJust as Christie saw a rush of popularity for his handling of Hurricane Sandy, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani rode a years-long wave of goodwill as \"America's Mayor\" for his response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. His Time \"Person of the Year' profile in 2001 described in grisly detail his visits to Ground Zero shortly after the attacks, at a time when other public officials were far less visible.\n\nEven when public appearances don't carry as clear or visible an element of physical risk, they can provide an anchoring force in a crisis.\n\n\"Cuomo in particular is just present,\" Goldman-Wetzler said. \"Why are we suddenly paying attention to him? Because he's there. Every hour he's posting on Twitter, he's making speeches, he's just showing up.\"\n\nIn other words, even upsetting daily news conferences, to many viewers, are vastly preferable to an upsetting lack of daily press conferences. \"When a leader is aware of that and shows up it's comforting. It almost matters less what they say and what they do, it matters more that they're there,\" Ms. Goldman-Wetzler said.\n\nIt's not surprising, then, that Fauci's absence from a recent White House press briefing led to immediate worried headlines about his \"disappearance.\"\n\nFrightened citizens who have come to depend on either Fauci or Cuomo as their sources of comfort or information, then, are likely to want their continued public presence until the crisis comes to an end. \"Every step of the way, they both are telling the truth, they show up, they're building trust with the American people,\" Goldman-Wetzler said. \"And when you have people's trust, whether you tell them 'it's safe to go outside now' or 'you actually still need to stay inside,' they believe you.\"", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "virginia_k_smith@marketwatch.com", "name": "Virginia K.

For instance New York, which is most affected in the U.S., saw the sharpest decline, while in Arizona, where the impact has been far less, the decline wasn't as steep.\n\n\"The positive here is that the data indicates that as the situation improves, and doesn't worsen, consumer behavior tends to return to more normal patterns,\" Chernofsky wrote.\n\n\"Should this trend hold, it's a very strong endorsement for those who believe that wider retail activity could quickly return to previous levels should the preventative measures being enacted serve their ultimate goal.\"\n\nPlacer.ai says some of the decline could be attributed to the increased use of delivery services and curbside pickup as shoppers try to follow social distancing guidelines.\n\nWatch:\n\nAdobe ADBE, -5.35% data shows that U.S. grocery e-commerce sales grew 25% for the period between March 13 and March 15 compared with the period between March 1 and March 11.\n\nAnd orders using buy-online-pickup-in-store capabilities soared 62% year-over-year between Feb. 24 and March 21. In addition to groceries, online orders for fitness equipment like dumbbells and computers also jumped during the month of March.\n\nAnd:\n\nTarget has seen a shift in spending such that consumers are buying small appliances to prepare all of the groceries that they've put in the pantry.\n\nOr, Placer.ai proposes, it could just be a lull before shoppers head out to stock up again.\n\nTarget stock has rallied 18.4% over the past year. Walmart shares have grown 16.8%. And Costco stock has gained 17%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -4.44% has slumped 20.3% for the period.\n\nDon't miss:", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tonya_garcia@marketwatch.com", "name": "Tonya Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Costco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Traffic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Traffic_Control", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Traffic Control", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Online_Traffic_Cameras", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Online Traffic Cameras", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-ID463_costco_ZG_20200331143535.jpg", "eventUri": null, "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 1215}, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 1215, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "6013714097", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-03-30", "time": "18:44:00", "dateTime": "2020-03-30T18:44:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-03-30T18:42:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/astrophysicist-hospitalized-after-getting-four-magnets-stuck-in-his-nose-while-making-a-coronavirus-device-2020-03-30", "title": "Astrophysicist hospitalized for getting four magnets stuck in his nose while making a coronavirus device", "body": "He was trying to invent something that stops people from touching their faces\n\nDo not try this at home.\n\nAn Australian astrophysicist put himself in the hospital last week after he got four magnets stuck up his nose while trying to invent a device to stop people from touching their faces during this pandemic.\n\nby close personal contact, such as shaking hands followed by touching your face, or by touching an object or surface that contains the virus, and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands. So Dr. Daniel Reardon, a research fellow at a Melbourne university, that he came up with the bright idea to create something to stop face-touching during \"a bit of boredom in isolation.\"\n\n\"I have some electronic equipment but really no experience or expertise in building circuits or things,\" he admitted. But he had a piece of equipment that detects magnetic fields. And he reasoned that if he could create such a charged field around his head, and then wear magnets on his wrist, \"it could set off an alarm if you brought [your hand] too close to your face.\"\n\nInstead, he accidentally created a necklace \"that buzzes continuously unless you move your hand close to your face,\" he said.\n\nBut Reardon, 27, wasn't deterred just yet. So he continued \"playing with the magnets,\" such as clipping them to his earlobes.\n\nAnd then he tried his nostrils.\n\n\" \"Things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril.\" \"\n\nHe explained that he put a magnet inside each of his nostrils, and then attached a magnet on the outside of each nostril -- but once he removed the outer magnets, the two magnets inside of his nose stuck together, and refused to come out.\n\nSo then he tried to use his remaining magnets to extract them, and ended up with all four in his nose.\n\n\"At this point I ran out of magnets,\" he said.\n\nAnd when he tried to use (metal) pliers to pull them out, the pliers also became magnetized. \"Every time I brought the pliers close to my nose, my entire nose would shift towards the pliers and then the pliers would stick to the magnet,\" he said. \"It was a little bit painful at this point.\"\n\nSo his partner took him to the hospital \"because she wanted all her colleagues to laugh at me,\" he continued. Two doctors were able to manually remove the magnets from his nose after treating him with pain-numbing anesthetic spray.\n\n\" \"Needless to say, I am not going to play with the magnets anymore.\" \"\n\nThere was a minor complication during the procedure, however: after the doctors got the three magnets out of his left nostril, the fourth one in the other nostril fell down his throat. Fortunately, he leaned forward and coughed it out before he swallowed it.\n\n\"Needless to say, I am not going to play with the magnets anymore,\" he said.\n\nwarned about the dangerous attraction to magnets earlier this year, particularly among children. An estimated 2,900 people who swallowed magnets from magnet sets were treated in U.S. emergency rooms between 2009 and 2013, and 1,900 of the victims were ages 4 through 12.\n\nGranted, not touching your face in order to avoid catching or spreading the coronavirus is indeed quite difficult, as the average person touches his or her face nine to 23 times an hour. But there are much easier ways to stop this unconscious habit than sticking magnets up your nose.

While it is too early to hazard a guess, some things are becoming increasingly clear.\n\nAlready, it looks as if the U.S. is moving towards a temporary moratorium on mortgage payments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Macwhich provides a two-month deferral of mortgage payments for any homeowner who claims to be facing a hardship because of the virus. The payments will be tacked on at the end of the mortgage term.\n\nThe coronavirus rescue law just enacted by Congress includes a provision which requires all firms that service federally-backed mortgages to grant a forbearance of up to 360 days for any borrowers who say they have been harmed by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIt is not much of a stretch to say that this virus has changed everything. Many of you may sense that the virus has undermined what you thought was still a fairly strong housing market around the country.\n\nIn truth, the so-called housing recovery since 2010 has been little more than a carefully constructed illusion. The belief in a strong housing recovery was carefully devised using a strategy of misleading information, withheld data and false impressions.\n\nRead:\n\nAs I have explained in , the strategy to turn around collapsing housing markets unfolded in three parts: (1) restrict the number of foreclosed properties placed on the market; (2) radically reduce the number of seriously delinquent homes actually foreclosed and repossessed, and (3) provide millions of delinquent homeowners a mortgage modification as an alternative to foreclosure. This strategy fooled nearly everyone into believing that the disaster has been overcome.\n\n\" With so few properties foreclosed and even fewer placed on the market, home prices had no where to go but up. \"\n\nThe best example is Los Angeles County -- ground zero for the collapse. In 2008, more than 37,000 properties were foreclosed. The plunge in foreclosures didn't really kick in until 2012 when the number dropped to slightly over 10,000. The next year, foreclosures plunged to 3,340. Don't think for a minute that this was due to an improving economy. Not at all. It was simply the strategy of desperate servicers. With so few properties foreclosed and even fewer placed on the market, home prices had no where to go but up.\n\nFor years now, data providers, mortgage servicers and lenders have done their best to hide the real mortgage situation from the public. The largest data providers have never explained why the number of mortgages in their databases has shrunk so dramatically. For example, the largest banks serviced nearly 2/3 of all first liens in 2011 and their data was reported quarterly to their regulator -- the Office of the Controller of the Currency (OCC). By 2019, that had plunged to less than 1/3.\n\nRead:\n\nWhat had happened? The housing crash had left them with millions of seriously delinquent first liens to deal with. This was new territory for them and they were operationally not up to the task. As the cost of servicing delinquent mortgages soared, most of the largest banks decided to sharply cut back their servicing business. So they sold most underwater loans in their portfolios as well as the mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). The 2019 FDIC Quarterly reported that the large servicing banks sold off $500 billion in mortgage servicing rights to non-bank servicers in 2013 alone. This sale of MSRs has continued right through 2019 when $635 billion changed hands.\n\nWho bought these loans and the servicing rights remains largely a mystery. The consequences were far reaching. Whereas the large bank servicers had reported detailed data to the agency which regulated national banks -- the OCC -- the new non-bank servicers didn't really report to anyone. This has left an enormous hole in the reported mortgage data.\n\nIn its June 2014 Mortgage Monitor, data provider Black Knight Financial Services reported that its coverage of non-agency securitized loans was slightly more than half of that universe. Hence, it extrapolated in order to estimate the entire non-agency market. In spite of having substantially fewer mortgages in its database obtained from the major bank servicers, Black Knight has never clarified or admitted how much its own mortgage database plunged since then.\n\nAnother example of this coverage shrinkage is what had happened to report on mortgage modifications. In 2013, the HOPE NOW consortium included 18 major firms that serviced more than 30 million loans. By the third quarter of 2019, it had dwindled to only 12 firms which serviced a mere 18 million loans. Because of this, HOPE NOW's extrapolated modification numbers have become little more than a guess.\n\nShocking re-default statistics\n\nLast October, MarketWatch published about the danger of mortgage modifications that re-defaulted. It did not include the data below, which shows truly scary re-default figures for non-agency RMBS loans.\n\nThis graph was compiled by Amherst Securities Group -- one of the best data providers at the time. It shows re-default rates as of July 2012 broken down by the year of modification. How many modifications were provided in just 2008-2010? HOPE NOW estimated that slightly under 4 million permanent modifications were completed in those three years alone.\n\nFor 2008 and 2009, Amherst's graph showed re-defaults ranging from 75-90%. For the peak year of modifications -- 2010 -- it reported rates of 50-60%. Re-default rates for 2011 modifications were heading toward 40% over a period of less than two years. These extremely high re-default rates were not reported by any other data provider.\n\nAmherst's re-default figures do not include failed forbearances. Forbearances are arrangements whereby the lender agrees to temporarily defer mortgage payments while the borrower deals with an allegedly temporary financial problem. The suspended payments are usually pushed down the road and not canceled. At the end of the forbearance period, a repayment plan often begins with a higher monthly payment. HOPE NOW estimated that during the 2008-10 period, 3.4 million repayment plans had been initiated.\n\nRead:\n\nA more recent study on modification re-defaults was published in 2015 by two researchers at the Federal Reserve Board. Although they used a relatively small sample of roughly 50,000 first liens, the study showed re-default statistics in line with the earlier report by Amherst.\n\nThe graph above shows the percentage of loans modified between 2008 and 2013 which were current and still being paid at the end of 2014. Those modified the earliest -- between 2008 and 2010 -- were current at rates of only 10% to 40%. This means they had re-defaulted at rates between 60% and nearly 90%.\n\nAccording to Attom Data's important quarterly report on the average gross profit for home sellers, 2013 was the first year when sellers in many major metros began to see a profit on the sale of their house. It was no accident that the greatest gains in gross profit occurred in California metros where mortgage servicers had brought foreclosures almost to a complete halt.\n\n2013 was also the year when the picture began to go dark on the non-agency securitized mortgage market. The very important quarterly report on non-agency mortgages put out by the American Securitization Forum ceased publication that year. The last comprehensive database which was a reliable source for the non-agency mortgage market was that of BlackBox Logic. Its entire database and analytic software was sold to Moody's in 2016. I have not found any Moody's report which made use of this important database.\n\nCoreLogic claims to have the largest non-agency securitized mortgage database of anyone. However, I have never seen any of their monthly foreclosure reports which made a connection between the rise in home prices and the orchestrated plunge in foreclosures.\n\nWhat can we infer from all this? First, the true condition of mortgage markets around the country is murkier than ever. Second, a full picture of mortgage modification re-defaults would offer us a much clearer understanding of how bad the delinquency situation really is. Third, data providers show no interest in giving us a more complete view, and finally, don't count on any help from the mortgage servicers.\n\nKeith Jurow is a real estate analyst who covers the

health-care workers treating coronavirus patients, Apple Inc. has donated more than 20 million face masks worldwide and has started manufacturing 1 million face shields a week, Chief Executive Tim Cook said Sunday.\n\n\"This is a truly global effort, and we're working continuously and closely with governments at all levels to ensure these are donated to places of greatest need,\" Cook said in a Twitter video posted Sunday afternoon.\n\nCook said Apple AAPL, -1.43% has launched a company-wide effort that includes product designers, engineers and suppliers to design, produce and ship face shields for health workers.\n\nCook said the first shipment of face shields was delivered last week to some hospitals in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe adjustable, plastic face shields can be assembled in less than two minutes, Cook said, and ship 100 to a box.\n\n\"We plan to ship over 1 million by the end of this week, and over 1 million per week after that,\" Cook said, adding that Apple is coordinating with medical professionals around the country to get the equipment to where it's needed the most, and that Apple hopes to soon expand distribution beyond the U.S.\n\n\"In both these efforts, out focus is on unique ways Apple can help, meeting essential needs of caregivers urgently and at a scale the circumstances require,\" Cook said. \"For Apple, this is a labor of love and gratitude, and we will share more of our efforts over time.\"\n\nIn other developments involving Silicon Valley's response to the pandemic:\n\n* Tesla Inc.

It would also likely provoke other countries to do the same, as some have already done.\n\n\"If that were to occur, the net number of respirators being made available to the United States would actually decrease,\" . \"That is the opposite of what we and the Administration, on behalf of the American people, both seek.\"\n\nThe company pointed out that after a request from the administration to increase respirators imported from its overseas operations, it was able to secure approval from the Chinese government, with help from the administration, to export 10 million N95 respirators that it made in China to the U.S.\n\nThe company's response comes after Trump tweeted late Thursday that he \"hit 3M hard,\" and that the company will have a \"big price to pay,\" as many in his administration were surprised with what 3M was doing with their masks.\n\nThe administration formally invoked the DPA to require 3M to prioritize orders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for N95 masks.\n\nEarlier this week, 3M said it has , including 35 million masks per month in the U.S. By June, the company said it expected to make 50 million masks in the U.S.\n\nIn an on Friday, Chief Executive Mike Roman said it was \"absurd\" for President Trump to suggest 3M wasn't doing everything it could to supply face masks to U.S. health-care workers. \"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" Roman said on CNBC's \"\" program.\n\nUsing the DPA to ask 3M to make more masks \"may not be as effective as we wish,\" as the shortage of masks is more a result of a lack of raw materials than of production capacity, according to Howard Yu, Lego professor of management and innovation at the Institute for Management Development in Switzerland. The raw material to make the N95 masks isn't usually in high demand during peacetime, Yu said.\n\n\"It requires once-obscure melt-blown fabric, an extremely fine mesh of synthetic polymer fibers,\" Yu said.\n\nYu said the administration also has to be careful in it's attempt to fight the pandemic in isolation by calling for a cease in exports of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\n\"No country can be completely self-sufficient,\" Yu said. \"The virus knows no border.\"\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reinforced that point in an interview on . He said 3M has indicated that it understands how important it is to continue with delivering on orders to places like Canada, \"because there is much trade that goes back and forth in essential services and it can end up hurting Americans as much as it hurts anybody else.\"\n\n3M's stock MMM, -2.98% fell 3.0% to close at $133.79, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.68% fell 361 points, or 1.7%. Year to date, 3M shares have shed 24.2% while the Dow has dropped 26.2%.\n\nDespite the boost in production in masks, from 3M and others, there is still expected to be an alarming shortfall. As , 3M and a half-dozen smaller competitors were producing about 50 million N95 masks in the U.S. each month, compared with the Department of Health and Human Services' estimate in March that U.S. health-care workers would need 300 million masks.\n\nSee related: .\n\nAnd demand for face masks are likely to increase substantially after Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the general public wear face masks.\n\nDon't miss: .\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio before leaving their homes, and it \"couldn't hurt\" to wear homemade face masks to stop the spread of coronavirus.\n\nEarlier this week, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker worked out a deal with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft to fly 1.2 million N95 masks from China to the U.S., with 300,000 of that supply going to New York. .\n\nLast month, Cuomo had called on local fashion designers to help produce PPE, including face masks and hospital gowns, and they listened, with many designers, including New York's Christian Siriano, Prabal Gurung and Rachel Comey, among others, announcing plans to join the fight of the COVID-19 pandemic. .\n\nThe supply of masks isn't the only issue.\n\nOn Friday, 3M said it will continue to fight against price gouging and the unauthorized reselling of its masks. \"This activity is unethical and illegal,\" 3M said. \"We are working with the U.S. Attorney General and attorneys general of every state, making it clear that 3M has not and will not raise prices for respirators and offering our assistance in the fight.\"\n\nDon't miss: .", "source": {"uri": "marketwatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarketWatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tomi_kilgore@marketwatch.com", "name": "Tomi Kilgore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respirator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Respirator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Good thing. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.24% posted its worst first quarter ever, his Satori Fund closed in positive territory.\n\nBut, more importantly, where do stock markets go from? Definitely not higher, if Niles has it right.\n\n\"If you go back and look at history, there are nine times that the market has sold off about 30% or so since the 1920s, so it's pretty normal,\" he said this week. \"You get one of these every 10 years or so and if you look at every one of them, you always get these bear market rallies.\"\n\nNiles told Yahoo Finance that he sees another major drop from here, pointing to valuations that are still hovering well above historical norms, even after the painful pullback.\n\n\"Just to get to average, you would have to have the market go down 30%,\" he said. \"It is very easy to figure out the market probably goes down 30% before we're even near fair valuation.\"\n\nSo, no bottom yet?\n\n\"I sort of laugh when I hear people talking about a V-shaped recovery because we are going to have at least 10% unemployment, my guess is closer to 20% before all of this is said and done,\" Niles said. \"You are not going to get a fast recovery with that many people out of a job and we're not just talking in the United States. We are talking all across the globe there are problems that are happening.\"\n\nNiles explained that he's still adding to his short positions, but he's also going long in areas he believes to be resistant to the next batch of selling.

New claims are likely keep climbing in the next few weeks as the damage unfolds.\n\nIn just the past two weeks alone, new claims have easily exceeded the peak number of people who collected benefits during the 2007-2009 recession. A then-record 6.6 million people drew benefits at the tail end of the last recession.\n\nSoon the clutch of unemployed Americans is likely to surpass the prior record of 15.3 million, also seen during what has become known as the Great Recession. Economists predict 25 million Americans or more could lose their jobs in the next few months, at least temporarily.\n\nRead:\n\nWhat happened: Initial jobless claims jumped by a seasonally adjusted 6.65 million from an upwardly revised 3.34 million in the prior week, . The increases in both weeks easily shattered the prior one-week record of 695,000 in October 1982.\n\nJust a month ago, new claims were in the low 200,000s and sat near a half-century low.\n\nThe astonishing increase in new claims suggests the unemployment rate shot up to around 10% at the end of March from an official 3.5% rate in February that marked a 50-year low. Never before has the unemployment rate risen so much so quickly.\n\nThe states recording the biggest increases last week were California (878,727), Pennsylvania (405,880) and New York (366,403), based on unadjusted data.\n\nCalifornia, the nation's largest state, has accounted for about 10% of all new claims in the past two weeks.\n\nSee:\n\nThe level of claims might still be underestimated, though. Some states continue to have trouble handling the huge influx of applications. Their small staff and computers systems have been overwhelmed after years of exceeding low claims.\n\nBig picture: The stunningly large increase in new claims clearly shows just how much damage the pandemic has done to the U.S. economy. The federal government is rushing to distribute more than $2 trillion in relief to businesses and households and provide a lifeline for the economy.\n\nRead:\n\nIt might not be enough, but it will help the economy in the short run. Millions of Americans who have lost their jobs or been furloughed might even get more money from unemployment benefits than they would have gotten in wages under their old jobs.\n\nRead:\n\nWhat they are saying? \"From extremely bad to even worse,\" said senior economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC World Markets, adding that the unemployment rate is likely to exceed 10% in the near future.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.03% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.33% were set to open higher in Thursday trades.

He again criticized top executives of 3M MMM, -2.98%.
