The mayor of Wuhan has said 5m people had left the city before authorities quarantined the metropolis of 11m and surrounding cities.\n\nSome 8,100 people were infected in the Sars outbreak in 2003 and 774 died after health authorities initially covered up the outbreak. Sars knocked quarterly economic growth down by 2 percentage points, from 11.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2003 to 9.1 per cent in the second quarter.\n\nMany analysts regarded the WHO decision on Thursday evening to declare a public health emergency of international concern as overdue, as the number of confirmed cases has risen quickly in China and around the world.\n\nIn practical terms, the declaration makes it easier for the WHO to co-ordinate the responses of governments around the world.\n\nDespite concerns about the speed of China's response, the WHO applauded China's handling of the outbreak.\n\n\"The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. \"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.\"\n\nBut within China, where the Wuhan coronavirus has brought normal life to a standstill and supplies of face masks and other medical supplies are running low, public anger is growing at the authorities for failing to keep the population safe.\n\nState broadcaster CCTV, which usually refrains from criticism of officials, ran a segment revealing the head of the health commission of Huanggang, a city of 7.5m with the second-largest number of coronavirus cases, failing to answer basic questions about the city's response.\n\nThe broadcaster posted a four-minute clip on Thursday showing health commission head Tang Zhihong and the head of the local centre for disease control and prevention Chen Mingxing unable to readily answer how many coronavirus patients, hospital beds and tested patients they had in the city. It has been viewed 35m times in the half day since it was posted on China's Twitter-like Weibo.\n\n\"Our taxpayers' money goes to support this group of good-for-nothings,\" said a top comment on the video, garnering 100,000 likes.

A chartered ANA flight carried 206 Japanese citizens out of the city, while a US flight departed earlier on Wednesday carrying government staff and civilians.\n\nBritish Airways said its decision to suspend flights follows advice from the Foreign Office that British nationals should avoid all but essential travel to mainland China due to the spread of the virus.\n\n\"We apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,\" British Airways said in a statement. The airline, which flies to Beijing and Shanghai, said it had blocked out sales on these routes from Wednesday until the beginning of March.\n\nThe move follows a decision by Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific to halve its flights to and from mainland China after the territory's chief executive Carrie Lam pledged to scale back transport links with the mainland to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nAmong other moves by multinationals, Toyota has delayed the restart of operations at four auto plants in China after the lunar new year holiday and Starbucks has closed 2,000 outlets in the country and cautioned that its annual financial results had been threatened by the deadly infection. China is the coffee chain's largest market outside US and its most important global growth engine.\n\nJapan's Fast Retailing has temporarily closed about 100 Uniqlo stores in Hubei and H&M have shut 45 stores.\n\nOther companies such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, LG Electronics and Facebook have suspended or restricted travel by employees to China.\n\nHong Kong's stock market suffered a sharp drop on reopening following the lunar new year break. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index dropped as much as 3 per cent after the Asian financial hub became the first Chinese market to reopen following the lunar holiday.\n\nThe Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the performance of large Chinese companies listed in the territory, was also down 3 per cent. However, European shares opened firmer and US futures trading pointed to gains on Wall Street.\n\nUnited Airlines has also suspended some flights between US cities and Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong from February 1 to February 8, pointing to a decline in demand for travel to China.\n\nApple on Tuesday warned about the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak on its supply chain, widening its guidance on revenue to take into account the uncertainty.\n\n\"The situation is unfolding, it's very new,\" said chief financial officer Luca Maestri. \"That's the reason we put a wider range on our guidance.\" He added that Apple had suppliers in the Wuhan areas that are being isolated, but that it had mitigation plans to source components from elsewhere if needed.\n\nShares in major airlines including British Airways' parent company IAG have been among the worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak, as concerns mount over the impact on global travel. Its shares have fallen more than 10 per cent since mid-January, while European rivals Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have also been hit.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

that originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan -- has had far-reaching ramifications on the corporate world. Here is a look at how sectors from luxury goods to automobiles are grappling with the fallout.\n\nLUXURY\n\nA queue of roughly 30 people, many of whom were speaking Chinese, queued at the Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Gucci stands in the Galeries Lafayette department store in Paris on Monday, writes Leila Abboud. Across the street at Galeries Lafayette's centre for Asian tourist groups, crowds of people were waiting to get tax refunds on their purchases.\n\nThe scenes in the French capital reflect how critical Chinese buyers have become to the global luxury goods sector. The luxury market grew 5 per cent in 2018 to reach \u20ac1.3tn, according to Bain & Co consultants, with Chinese customers shopping at home and abroad accounting for 90 per cent of the growth. Chinese customers now account for more than a third of the value of luxury goods purchases.\n\nThis means that the industry's conglomerates such as LVMH, Kering and Richemont, as well as brands like Herm\u00e8s and Burberry, are particularly exposed to a drop-off in Chinese demand.\n\nLuxury brands have so far weathered a drop in sales since the political protests in Hong Kong because many of the purchases were repatriated to mainland China, or elsewhere in Asia. The coronavirus could change all that.\n\nJo\u00eblle de Montgolfier, director of Bain's luxury practice, said the coronavirus could have a \"double whammy effect\" on the sector. \"Not only will Chinese people buy less domestically during the key New Year shopping season, they will also have to cancel trips abroad, during which they often buy luxury goods,\" she said.\n\nChina's Ministry of Culture and Tourism on Monday told travel agencies to temporarily suspend the sale of group tours abroad.\n\nIt is too early for the effects to be seen in Paris shops, but investors in the sector -- which before the outbreak had been trading at valuations not seen in a decade -- are spooked. Shares in LVMH are down 4 per cent this year so far, while Kering is down 8 per cent and Burberry dropped 9 per cent.\n\nRBC analysts estimated that a 10 per cent drop in Chinese consumption in the first half of the year would translate into a 2 per cent reduction in luxury companies' revenues, and a hit to annual profits of up to 4 per cent.\n\nLEISURE\n\nNo official fireworks will mark the Chinese new year in Macau on Monday as the world's largest gambling hub cancelled all its celebrations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, writes Alice Hancock in London. Dealers in its casinos wore masks, casino visitors were temperature checked, and parts of the gaming floors were closed off.\n\nMacau is a popular destination for travellers from China where gambling is officially illegal, and it relies predominantly on Chinese visitors for its tourism revenue.\n\n\"Macau makes money off China. It's not foreign tourists that drive business there,\" said Charles Gillespie, chief executive of Gambling.com. He added that the lack of Chinese visitors would \"really take the legs out\" of Macau's casinos, many of which are owned by international entertainment companies including MGM and Wynn Resorts.\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus on Macau has been immediate.\n\nFigures from Macau's tourist office show the number of tourists from mainland China fell 80 per cent on Sunday, the third day of the Chinese new year holiday, compared to the same day last year. Overall inbound tourist numbers were down 60 per cent over the three days of the holiday so far.\n\nShares in the major casino companies with resorts in the territory fell, with Las Vegas Sands down about 6 per cent and Wynn Resorts nearly 7 per cent.\n\nThere were some unexpected beneficiaries of the Macau shutdown, however: gambling companies licensed in the Philippines. The Philippines is Asia's online gambling hub, offering betting to the Chinese market.\n\n\"When people in China are forced to stay at home they go online. We have seen a massive surge in online gaming as a result of the virus,\" said Jason Ader, chief executive of SpringOwl Asset Management, an investment manager.\n\nMany other Chinese leisure destinations have shut as a result of the virus outbreak.\n\nDisneyland closed its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong \"as a precautionary measure,\" and said it would aim to refund guests that had booked park tickets or hotel rooms.\n\nThe National Museum of China, Forbidden City, Beijing's Olympic Stadium and parts of the Great Wall of China were also closed.\n\nMajor hotel groups including Hilton, Marriott, Accor and InterContinental waived cancellation fees until February 8. Airbnb said it will allow hosts and guests living in or travelling to the Hubei province -- the epicentre of the coronavirus -- to cancel their reservations up to February 8 with no charge.\n\nCruise companies such as Royal Caribbean and Carnival banned passengers that had recently come from Wuhan from coming on board and cancelled sailings. Starbucks closed stores in Wuhan and McDonald's has suspended its business in Wuhan and surrounding cities where public transport has been closed.\n\nSeven blockbuster films due to be released at the weekend, including Jackie Chan's Vanguard, were cancelled as thousands of cinemas closed their doors, according to a report in Variety magazine.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in London and Alistair Gray in New York\n\nAIRLINES\n\nGlobal airline stocks were battered on Monday as fears grew that the rapid spread of the coronavirus could have far-reaching effects on people's willingness and ability to travel in China and beyond, writes Myles McCormick in London.\n\nAnalysts drew comparisons to the Sars outbreak almost two decades ago -- described by Lufthansa's then-chief executive as the airline industry's \"worst-ever crisis\".\n\n\"If people take a view they shouldn't be travelling or shouldn't go to a place or be on planes with people who might have been to certain places, they're less likely to travel,\" said Andrew Charlton, a Geneva-based aviation analyst. \"It's going to have an impact on passenger numbers.\"\n\nAirline stocks were among the biggest fallers in European equities, with Air France-KLM leading the pack downwards to shed almost 6 per cent. Other major European carriers with exposure to China also took a hit -- BA-owner IAG fell 5.5 per cent, while Germany's Lufthansa dropped more than 4 per cent.\n\nEven airlines with no direct exposure to China came under pressure on fears that a drop-off in passengers flying out of the country could reverberate globally. EasyJet slipped 5 per cent, while Ryanair was down 3 per cent. Many stock markets across Asia and Australia were closed for public holidays on Monday, meaning shares of carriers likely to be directly affected, including Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific, Australia's Qantas, Singapore Airlines and others in mainland China have not traded on the weekend's developments.\n\nAnalysts said it remained too early to quantify the extent of the impact on passenger numbers. As a benchmark, many pointed to the Sars virus, which reduced airline revenues by billions and caused passenger volumes on the key Hong Kong to Europe route to fall by about a third from November 2002 to July 2003.\n\n\"It's not clear how to market-size this yet,\" said Mark Manduca, an analyst at Citigroup. \"Does one compare it with Zika? Does one compare it with Sars?\"\n\nBANKS\n\nInternational banks and wealth managers, which have expanded aggressively into China in recent years, have been ringfencing potentially exposed staff, putting in place travel bans, and disinfecting their Asia offices, write Stephen Morris and Owen Walker in London.\n\nCredit Suisse told staff in Hong Kong to work from home and not come into its headquarters in the International Commerce Center tower if they have visited the mainland in the last 14 days.\n\nAffected employees will be required to remain at home for at least a fortnight and get a doctor's certificate before they return if they have fever or flu-like symptoms. The bank is also offering temperature checks in its main office, which remains open.\n\nCredit Suisse has also told staff that business travel should be limited to \"essential travel only\".\n\nFellow Swiss bank UBS has also told its 2,500 workforce in Hong Kong to stay at home if they have travelled to China recently. Its main offices in China remain open, but staff are banned from travelling to China unless it is deemed \"critical\", a spokesman said.\n\nHSBC has instigated \"more restrictive travel policies\", but travel to the mainland from Hong Kong is not banned. Staff have been told not to come into the office until February 3, the date when the Chinese lunar new year has been extended to by the government.\n\nMeanwhile, Standard Chartered has also restricted all non-essential staff travel to its China and Hong Kong offices, banned trips to the Wuhan and Hubei provinces, and asking those returning from affected areas to work from home for 14 days.\n\nFidelity International, a $584bn investment manager, said it was encouraging China-based staff to work from home. And Allianz Global Investors, the \u20ac557bn investment arm of the German insurer, advised staff to refrain from travelling to affected areas before the Chinese new year holidays.\n\nInternational carmakers including Nissan, PSA and Renault have begun pulling foreign staff from plants across parts of China that have been hit by the coronavirus, amid warnings the outbreak could further hamper the country's struggling auto market, writes Peter Campbell in London.\n\nThe industry faces a \"traumatic next few months\" with consumers likely to delay car purchases, said Robin Zhu, an analyst at Bernstein. The 40 Chinese cities that have reported double-digit confirmed cases of coronavirus account for 40 per cent of China's car market, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, several auto executives said a reliance on parts suppliers from the Hubei region may prevent some plants reopening following the Chinese new year holiday.\n\nWuhan is a major automotive hub, with plants from Nissan, PSA, Honda, General Motors, Geely and Renault, as well as a large range of car parts suppliers, which serve a wider network of assembly plants.\n\nCarmakers hold very little stock at their assembly operations, instead relying on just-in-time supply chains that see parts delivered to the assembly plant hours or even minutes before required in the factory.\n\nMichael Dunne, a former GM executive who runs the China-focused ZoZo Go auto consultancy, said Nissan, PSA and Honda are likely to be the most affected by supplier shutdowns, as they have significant operations in the region.\n\nCompanies with staff on the ground are also working with their home governments to help expatriate employees leave the country.\n\nNissan is preparing to fly its Japanese staff in Wuhan home on a government-chartered flight, a spokesperson said. French carmaker PSA has also begun evacuating 38 people, including expatriates and their families, from its three production sites in the region, the company said on Monday, while Renault is offering its staff the chance to leave.\n\nBernstein's Mr Zhu said: \"Realistically, we fear investors will need to brace for a slowdown in broader activity levels in China.\"\n\nWhen the Sars outbreak began in China in 2002, the relatively small number of mobile phone owners there were only just discovering text messaging, write Tim Bradshaw in London, Ryan McMorrow and Sun Yu in Beijing, and Tom Hancock in Wuhan.\n\nToday, China is the world's largest mobile market, with 1.4bn people relying on their smartphones for payments, food ordering and countless other transactions every day.\n\nThat dependence on smartphones may become a blessing or a curse as China attempts to contain the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nOnline food ordering is helping to sustain residents in the locked-down city of Wuhan, even if the millions of couriers across China who deliver meals and groceries pose a potential risk of carrying the virus too.\n\nDelivery drivers were still operating on the streets of Wuhan on Monday, some of them working longer shifts to meet demand.\n\nTo mitigate potential infection, Meituan, the Beijing-based food ordering company, has introduced a new \"contactless delivery\" system in Wuhan that it expects to roll out across the rest of China by the end of the week. Couriers, who are now required to wear face masks, are dropping meal orders at a customer's doorstep or office lobby, instead of handing it to them directly.\n\nMeituan is also donating millions of dollars' worth of food to Wuhan's hospital workers via large food cupboards -- another move to avoid direct contact between medics and couriers.\n\nOther tech companies operating in China, from Baidu to Apple, have also made various pledges of support. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in a tweet on Saturday that the company would be \"donating to groups on the ground helping support all of those affected\".\n\nChinese tech groups have also taken steps to protect their workforces, with companies including internet group Tencent extending the Lunar New Year holiday and asking employees to work from home.\n\nFoxconn's Zhengzhou manufacturing facility, which accounted for 15 per cent of global mobile phone output in 2018, said it would delay resuming production by a few days, to February 1, and put off hiring.\n\nStill, Dan Ives at Wedbush -- one of the most bullish Apple analysts on Wall Street -- played down the potential impact on iPhone demand as \"negligible\".\n\n\"We believe with the limited transportation in major cities throughout China and limited foot traffic in Shanghai, Beijing, and other cities that at most [around] 1m iPhones in the region could be at risk of shifting out of the March quarter into the June quarter,\" said Mr Ives. This \"would be less than 3 per cent of Chinese annual iPhone sales at most and a very containable risk.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [],

holiday period, achieving one of the biggest quarterly profits for any company and helping to justify a stock price that has more than doubled in the last year.\n\nThe Cupertino tech giant said revenues rose 9 per cent to $91.8bn, as iPhone revenues climbed 8 per cent in addition to accelerated sales of AirPods, watches and its growing \"services\" division.\n\nNet profit grew 11 per cent to $22.2bn, enough to surpass its $20.1bn record quarter from two years ago. Earnings per share were even better, climbing 19 per cent to $4.99.\n\nBoth top-line and bottom-line figures were significantly higher than projections, which saw revenues at $88.1bn and profits at $20.1bn, according to an analyst poll compiled by Visible Alpha.\n\n\"We are thrilled to report Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, fueled by strong demand for our iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models, and all-time records for Services and Wearables,\" chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement.\n\nMr Cook said Apple's \"active installed base\" of users is now above 1.5bn, versus 1.4bn a year ago. \"We see this as a powerful testament to the satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers -- and a great driver of our growth across the board.\"\n\nFor the current quarter Apple is projecting between $63bn and $67bn of revenue, a gain of 9-15 per cent. Chief financial officer Luca Maestri said the range is \"unusually wide\" to account for \"potential impact\" across the supply chain because of the coronavirus.\n\n\"The situation is unfolding, it's very new,\" he said. \"That's the reason we put a wider range on our guidance.\"\n\nHe added that Apple has suppliers in the Wuhan areas that are being isolated, but that Apple had mitigation plans to source components from elsewhere if needed.\n\nApple's stock has more than doubled in the last year, reaching a $1.4tn market capitalisation. The rally set expectations high for a strong quarter, but analysts had assumed iPhone sales would be stagnant or lower. Instead, they grew from $52bn a year ago to $56bn.\n\n\"When the iPhone grows, and then you add growth from services and wearables, the total results are very strong,\" said Mr Maestri.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AirPods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_11_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 11 Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Maestri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luca Maestri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installed_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Installed base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F88648af4-4201-11ea-a879-e56a76ed3e8a?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "eventUri": "eng-5466271", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 6}, "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 6, "relevance": 27}, {"uri": "1426877635", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-01-28", "time": "22:02:00", "dateTime": "2020-01-28T22:02:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-01-28T22:01:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/3f753fb8-4202-11ea-a047-eae9bd51ceba", "title": "Starbucks closes more than 2,000 China stores as virus hit", "body": "Starbucks revealed it has closed more than 2,000 outlets in China and cautioned that its annual financial results could be put at risk as the US-based coffee chain grapples with the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIn a sign of the risks facing corporate America from the rapidly spreading virus, Starbucks said on Tuesday it has shut more than half of its near-4,300 caf\u00e9s in the country and reduced opening hours at an undisclosed number of others.\n\nIn quarterly results on Tuesday, Starbucks said: \"Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the duration of business disruption, reduced customer traffic and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but are expected to materially affect\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009results for the [current] quarter, and full year of fiscal 2020.\"\n\nThe results come at a time of nervousness on Wall Street about the financial impact of the deadly virus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and has spread throughout the country and wider region.\n\nFood and beverage companies are among the most exposed.

According to research published on Friday, a new Sars-like coronavirus has been present in China since December 1, a full month before the alarm was raised. Almost 3,000 people have been diagnosed with the respiratory illness. As of Monday afternoon, 35 cases were outside China. Eighty-one people have died.\n\nDespite draconian quarantining, the virus, provisionally known as 2019-nCoV, is spreading. Several countries, including the UK, are considering evacuating nationals from the hot zone. It is now time for the World Health Organisation to call a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n\nThe revised timeline on when the virus began circulating comes courtesy of two papers in The Lancet medical journal, which reveal other worrying details. One sets out the clinical data on the first 41 laboratory-confirmed patients.\n\nPatient zero, who fell ill on December 1, had no link to the seafood market in Wuhan that is widely assumed to be the source of the outbreak. A further 13 of those 41 cases showed no link either. It is possible that the virus began circulating earlier than December.\n\nOther analyses separately suggest that containment is now a forlorn hope. The \"reproduction number\" is thought to lie between two and four -- meaning that, on average, each infected person passes the virus to between two and four others. That is high: seasonal flu has a reproduction rate of about 1.4.\n\nThe incubation period could be about a week, with infected individuals possibly being contagious while showing mild or no symptoms. Neil Ferguson, an Imperial College epidemiologist, estimated that 4,000 were infected by January 18. Jonathan Read, of Lancaster University, and colleagues provisionally calculate that the tally could exceed 190,000 by February 4.\n\nA \"grave situation\" for China, as President Xi Jinping describes the epidemic, is a grave situation for the world. A fifth of the global population is now potentially exposed to a highly transmissible, currently incurable and potentially fatal respiratory virus.\n\nRichard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, believes a PHEIC declaration should be considered. \"The emergency committee [of the WHO] should reconvene as a matter of urgency,\" Mr Horton said, adding that he felt there were political sensitivities at play that have not dogged other epidemics, such as Ebola in west Africa.\n\nRecent developments, such as a special committee set up by China's ruling party, have also heightened rather than allayed his concerns. He says: \"Not one [of the people on that committee] has any background in public health. That makes me very worried.\" Mr Horton also fears the mass social unrest that may accompany prolonged quarantine with patchy information.\n\nIt is unclear whether the WHO knew in advance of China's quarantine plans. The language emerging from its meetings has been painfully diplomatic, with its director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus remarking only that he hoped the extreme measures were \"both effective and short in their duration\".\n\nSir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said it was \"right and appropriate\" for China to control the first response. Antivirals were going into randomised trials on the ground, he said, and vaccines might become available within six months. He acknowledged, though, that the social consequences of quarantining millions of people remained \"uncharted territory\".\n\nAll factors considered, it is perverse to see the coronavirus outbreak as anything other than a PHEIC.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki",

traders brace for return to work after coronavirus outbreak", "body": "Traders in Shanghai are preparing to return to work next week, even though the worsening coronavirus outbreak could leave mainland China's financial hub severely depleted.\n\nLocal brokerages and asset managers said they expected to field reduced teams on Monday morning, when equity and bond markets in the world's second-biggest economy resume trading after an extended lunar new year break. That is despite orders from the Shanghai government that most businesses stay shut until February 9.\n\nThe temporary closure of business activity in the city of over 20m people comes as concerns mount over the coronavirus epidemic, which has killed more than 130 people and infected thousands, mostly in the central province of Hubei.\n\nZhang Pan, director of research at Shanghai-based Raman Capital, which manages over $430m in bonds, said six of its 27 employees will report to work. However, they will trade wearing face masks and with no air conditioning, in a bid to counter the spread of the virus. \"Bond trading resumes on Monday and we need to make the market function,\" Mr Zhang said.\n\nStaff at other Shanghai-based companies expressed surprise that the central bank has allowed trading, clearing and settlement to resume. \"I was a bit surprised when they said 'open on Monday', but I guess they want to come back to normality,\" said one director at a Shanghai brokerage.\n\n\"You cannot do this type of job entirely from home, you need some people at the office,\" he added, noting that his company has told those with symptoms of the virus to stay at home.\n\nCompanies that disobey the shutdown could face repercussions. Shanghai-based lawyer Dong Fei wrote on the official WeChat account of the city's bar association that businesses defying the order could be fined up to Rmb120,000 ($17,300) or have their licences removed.\n\nBut Shanghai-based brokers pointed out loopholes in the official orders. Exceptions are made for \"companies important to the national economy and peoples' livelihoods\" -- without specifying what those are.\n\nUnease among market participants is not limited to Shanghai. Shen Xiao, a high-yield bond fund manager at Zhongji Investments in Beijing, said he was not sure whether he will be in the office next week. \"I need to have access to computers in the office if I want to borrow funds to make trades,\" Mr Shen said. \"I haven't made a decision because of the disease.\"\n\nShenzhen, which is home to mainland China's second stock market, has said its bourse will also resume trading on Monday, after the central bank pushed back the reopening originally scheduled for Friday.\n\nBut the local government has not imposed restrictions on companies operating in the city, even after the provincial government for Guangdong ordered businesses not to return to work until February 10. Hong Kong, with which Shenzhen shares a border, has paused rail services with the mainland and suspended permits for Chinese tourists visiting the territory.\n\nTraders may have a tough task when the opening bell rings on Monday. Shares in Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and New York have been battered in recent days by concerns over the spread of the virus and the pressure it will put on China's already slowing growth.\n\nWhen Hong Kong's stock market resumed trading on Thursday, the benchmark Hang Seng index dropped almost 3 per cent, its biggest daily drop since August. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index -- which contains big mainland Chinese companies listed in the territory -- finished the day down 3.3 per cent.\n\nFinancial and industrial stocks tracked by the China-focused index were among those hardest hit by the sell-off, falling 3.6 per cent and 4.8 per cent, respectively. These two market segments alone account for nearly half the weighting by market capitalisation of Shanghai's benchmark composite index.\n\nAnalysts said they expected a sharp sell-off in mainland Chinese stocks on Monday when trading resumes, with foreign investors using Hong Kong's stock connect programme among market participants most likely to offload shares.\n\nAuthorities are also aware of pent-up selling pressure among the country's retail investors, who have watched share prices elsewhere in the region drop in response to the outbreak. This week, China's securities regulator pre-emptively instructed traders to \"actively guide investors to rationally, objectively analyse the impact of the outbreak\" and \"adhere to the concepts of long-term and value investment\".\n\n\"The main concern is what sentiment in the market will be on Monday,\" said the brokerage director in Shanghai. \"I don't think there's going to be any kind of operational constraint there.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type":

to more than 100 and the number of people infected jumped by almost half on Tuesday as foreign nationals prepared to evacuate from the quarantined city of Wuhan.\n\nInternational markets fell further on the expected economic fallout from the crisis after several cities in China extended the lunar new year break that began on Saturday by another week.\n\nSingapore's FTSE Straits Times dropped 2.6 per cent, Seoul's Kospi index was down 3.1 per cent while and Tokyo's Topix fell another 1 per cent following heavy losses on Monday. Mining stocks led Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lower by 1.5 per cent. Singapore, Seoul and Sydney were closed for public holidays on Monday.\n\nThe vast majority of the deaths have occurred in Hubei province, where cases were first reported in December. Beijing, the Chinese capital, reported its first casualty on Tuesday.\n\nMarkets in China remain closed for the week, but analysts expect a sharp drop in Hong Kong when the city's stock exchange reopens on Wednesday.\n\nConfirmed cases of the Sars-like respiratory illness in China rose to 4,459, from fewer than 3,000 on Monday, as the country continued to celebrate the lunar new year holiday that witnesses the world's largest annual mass movement of people.\n\nResearchers at the University of Hong Kong, however, said the number of infections could be much higher. On Monday, the university estimated that at least 25,630 people in Wuhan were showing symptoms of the disease and around 44,000 were infected with the disease but not yet showing symptoms\n\nAs cases appear in the US and Europe, the outbreak has grabbed the attention of leaders around the world. Foreign governments, fearful of a repeat of the Sars epidemic in 2003 that killed nearly 800 people, are making urgent plans to repatriate their citizens\n\nThe US has urged its citizens to avoid travel to China and is planning an evacuation of its nationals on Tuesday evening. The US flight will leave from Wuhan Tianhe airport at about 10pm, according to an email to passengers seen by the Financial Times.\n\nA group of workers from US manufacturer Corning will be on the flight, alongside diplomats and workers from the Wuhan consulate.\n\nJapan will evacuate about 200 Japanese citizens from the city on Tuesday night, the country's foreign minister said.\n\nThe British health secretary said on Monday that London was \"rapidly advancing measures to bring UK nationals back from Hubei province\" although no time for such an operation was given.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said on Twitter on Monday that he was headed to Beijing to meet the country's leaders. WHO has refrained from declaring the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\n\nA number of foreign companies, such as Microsoft and US agricultural group Cargill, have promised donations for the relief effort.\n\nAs the outbreak has intensified in recent days -- the number of infected has risen from only 570 on Thursday -- the Chinese government has taken unprecedented measures to contain the coronavirus.\n\nAn area home to about 40m people in Hubei province has been quarantined and cities and provinces across the country have announced curbs on public transport.\n\nThe national new year holiday has been extended by three days nationwide and several cities, such as the financial hub of Shanghai and the manufacturing centre of Suzhou, have said workers cannot return to their posts until the second week of February.\n\nThose measures have prompted concerns that the outbreak would drag down China's economic growth in the first quarter of the year.\n\nEswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University, said: \"The Chinese government, and other governments in Asia and elsewhere, face the difficult challenge of taking stringent measures to contain the spread of the virus and getting their populations to take the risks seriously, while mitigating widespread panic that could prove counterproductive in some respects.\"\n\nFollowing heavy criticism of its slow and opaque response to Sars 17 years ago, Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, are under international pressure to handle the crisis in a timely and transparent manner.\n\nSigns of infighting between the central and local governments have already surfaced, with the mayor of Wuhan admitting in an interview with state television on Monday that local authorities had covered up the outbreak. He also offered his resignation.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type":

registered its first two cases of coronavirus and gloomy economic data soured investor sentiment in Europe.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index, the continent-wide benchmark, is down 0.5 per cent, following the release of economic data that showed the eurozone's fourth-quarter growth in 2019 was only 0.1 per cent, below expectations of 0.2 per cent.\n\nBourses in Paris and Frankfurt are down 0.6 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively, while London's FTSE 100 index has slipped 0.9 per cent.\n\nEurorstat data revealed the eurozone ended last year with a whimper, as the French and Italian economies both shrank unexpectedly, denting hopes that the region was poised to rebound from its recent sluggish performance.\n\n\"The main question now is whether the looming threat of a sudden stop in Q1 global activity -- due to disruptions over the coronavirus -- will drag eurozone GDP growth down even further,\" said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nGovernment bonds in the eurozone extended their gains this week following the disappointing growth data, pushing yields to fresh lows for the year. The yield on the 10-year German Bund fell 1 basis point to minus 0.42 while the yield on the equivalent gilt dropped 2bp to 0.53 per cent.\n\nBonds have already rallied significantly in recent days as fear over the spread of coronavirus has fuelled demand for haven assets.\n\n\"The market impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009increasingly resembles last year's trade-war-driven turmoil in May and August,\" said Jonas Goltermann at Capital Economics. \"But unless the fallout from the epidemic escalates significantly, it is hard to see the sharp falls in bond yields persisting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, worries surrounding the coronavirus continued to hamper markets around the world following the World Health Organisation's declaration on Thursday that its spread now constitutes a public health emergency. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down 0.5 per cent while South Korea's Kospi ended its session 1.33 per cent lower.\n\nGoldman Sachs estimates that the epidemic will lower annual average Chinese GDP by 0.4 per cent, which will have a spillover effect on US growth in the first quarter of the year. \"The drag on growth operates mostly through lower tourism from China and lower US goods exports to China,\" its analysts wrote.\n\nBrent crude, which has fallen heavily this week owing to concerns surrounding weakening oil demand, is rebounding. The international benchmark is up 0.4 per cent to $58.51 a barrel while WTI, the US marker, is 1 per cent higher at $52.69 a barrel.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

the politics of the UK's departure from the EU. Now that Britain has formally left the union and entered a transition period, some investors expect the currency to gain as a reduction in uncertainty boosts confidence and economic growth.\n\nBut even the optimists think the pound's status as a currency driven by politics is here to stay, with the shape of the trade deal with the EU set to dominate discussions later this year.\n\n\"The removal of uncertainty should help bring back some strength to the currency,\" said David Zahn, head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton. Mr Zahn added that concerns about a hard Brexit could return if there is no agreement on the table as the year draws to a close.\n\nThe path of growth, and the Bank of England's response to it, will be crucial. Sterling has climbed modestly, trading above $1.31 against the dollar after the BoE decided not to cut interest rates last week. But many investors continue to bet on cuts later in the year, with markets pricing a more than 75 per cent chance of a reduction by September.\n\nThe probability of the BoE cutting rates increased after the central bank last week downgraded its view of the underlying prospects for the economy to the lowest level since the second world war.\n\n\"The BoE has made it clear that it will be looking closely at the data to determine the next move, so for now fundamentals should be the shorter-term driving force for the pound, until Brexit trade negotiations become front and centre again,\" said Ian Tew, a sterling trader at Barclays. Tommy Stubbington\n\nInvestors will have their first glimpse at the health of US manufacturing this year on Monday after a widely watched measure for the sector dipped in December to its lowest level since June 2009.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management will release its January data showing manufacturing purchasing behaviour. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate the index to hit 48.5 points, a modest increase from December's figure of 47.2, but below the 50-point level that separates contraction from expansion.\n\nEquity investors are paying more attention to manufacturing data as a gauge for the health of the US economy in part because the Federal Reserve has moved into a holding pattern on interest rates, said Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist for Credit Suisse.\n\n\"The ISM manufacturing index is expected to get better,\" Mr Golub said. \"Stock market returns are strongest when the ISM recovers from depressed levels.\"\n\nOn Friday, two other data points will help investors gauge the health of the world's largest economy. The non-farm payroll numbers are expected to show 150,000 jobs were created in January, an increase from the 145,000 added in December, and the unemployment rate is set to hold firm at 3.5 per cent, according to a Bloomberg poll of economists.\n\nThe Fed is grappling with the dynamic of low inflation despite a tight labour market. Low unemployment typically leads to higher wages, increasing inflation. Richard Henderson\n\nAustralian markets are under pressure, with the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 slipping about 2 per cent last week, before recovering. The coronavirus has hit the China-dependent economy, and its mining stocks in particular, while the nation continues to be shaken by bushfires of unprecedented severity that have squeezed insurance, dairy and travel stocks.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, its central bank will on Tuesday decide whether an interest-rate cut is warranted. The economy is in decent shape, with the jobless rate dipping to a nine-month low of 5.1 per cent in December. Analysts are therefore not convinced that the Reserve Bank of Australia will be pressed in to action.\n\nSally Auld, chief economist at JPMorgan, said that while it was clear the virus would have a meaningful regional impact, the RBA would not rush in its assessment of the crisis.\n\nHowever, she said that Australia's exposure to the Chinese tourism market could be costly, as the viral outbreak curbs travel. \"Is that enough to get them to cut [on Tuesday]? Probably not at the margin, but it does mean that they will be nervously on hold given the downside risks.\"\n\nEconomists at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia agreed that there is no great risk of the RBA taking action, but National Australia Bank said the market's estimate of the chance of a rate-cut is \"too low,\" at 31 per cent. Even if the central bank holds steady, NAB is expecting two cuts in the rest of this year.\n\n\"We have not been a believer in the RBA's general upturn narrative and are even less so now,\" the bank's economists said.

"The challenge of thinking a couple of steps ahead", "body": "FT subscribers can click here to receive Market Forces every day by email.\n\nThinking a couple of steps ahead is helping to contain a deeper washout for broad equity markets at the moment.\n\nThe human toll from the coronavirus worryingly continues growing, with the World Health Organization on Thursday declaring an international public health emergency over the outbreak, while companies and countries increase preventive measures. But so far the selling pressure linked to the epidemic has been relatively contained, with a clear divide between haven and riskier assets.\n\nThe distinction is evident in Europe's Stoxx 600, which is now a touch lower for the month after being up 2.1 per cent in mid-January. Utilities and healthcare stand out as havens for this market, while major economically sensitive sectors, such as carmakers, basic resources, energy and the travel/leisure industry, are sharply lower for January.\n\nFor the S&P 500, it's a similar story, but with its vaunted technology sector accompanying utilities at the top, while energy and materials are notable decliners. True, the S&P 500 has clipped much of its 3.1 per cent gain set in mid-January. Still, in broad terms the correction remains modest in tone.\n\nSuch resilience does surprise some, though. John Velis at BNY Mellon thinks \"there is some degree of 'optimistic complacency' at work\", adding:\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that even under the best-case scenario, China doesn't take a large economic hit. Thus, to us, it seems that some risk market pricing is far too sanguine.\"\n\nStill, he concedes:\n\n\"Perhaps they're looking two moves ahead, to the eventual stimulus to come out of Beijing.\"\n\nA nasty growth shock for China is ultimately seen spurring a hefty round of stimulus, an outcome that will drive asset markets once the epidemic peaks. The prospect of stimulus is highlighted by the offshore renminbi weakening through Rmb7 per dollar earlier on Thursday. The offshore rate trades outside of mainland China.\n\nBefore then, there are some amber lights flashing. Risk assets have enjoyed a great run in recent months so it doesn't take much to flush out the late arrivals, which can snowball. Grounds for a larger correction requires a lot more bad news, but, as the global macro strategy team at Citi notes, holders of risk assets should be prepared:\n\n\"[A] further international outbreak of the virus is highly probable, and this will weaken sentiment, making the dichotomy between markets and fundamentals even more stark. Of course, there will be a time to buy a dip in risk assets but it might not be here. Further downside is likely unless/until monetary juicing accelerates.\"\n\nAnother important point is raised by DWS, particularly as there has been little shortage of comparisons with the Sars epidemic. The asset manager writes:\n\n\"Anyone wishing to draw comparisons, particularly with the Sars epidemic of 2002/2003, should bear in mind, however, that the market was then close to its low point and that the mood among companies and investors was generally very weak. This time the virus has been hitting a capital market that has had one of its best starts of the year, with new record highs, especially in (growth) stocks, low volatility and, most recently, investors who are once again very optimistically positioned.\"\n\nIn economic terms, China and Asia today constitute a far more important presence in the global economy. This region was expected to keep the global economy ticking in 2020 as the US slowed and Europe was in recovery mode.\n\nChina's service sector is also much larger than was the case during the Sars epidemic from 2002 to 2003. This means broader activity could take longer to recover from the current shutdown. Here is Citi's take along with a couple of charts:\n\n\"The service industry contributes 10ppts more to Chinese GDP now than in 2003 (now 53%), whilst EM Asia's contribution to Global GDP has almost doubled since then.\"\n\nThe longer-term view is that a dip-buying opportunity awaits as the threat of a recession still looks low. While that's a reasonable basis for thinking ahead, the question of correctly timing the turn in asset prices is very much an art.\n\nHavens such as gold remain in demand, while flows into government bonds on Thursday pulled the 10-year Treasury yield back under that of three-month bills. A renewed inversion of the yield curve takes us back to October. Beyond the hit to global growth from the coronavirus, the bond market also doubts the Federal Reserve can spur higher inflation and growth by sticking to the policy sidelines this year.\n\nThursday's release of US growth for the fourth quarter revealed an annual rate of 2.1 per cent, but beyond the headline there were some points of concern. Oxford Economics notes:\n\n\"More than 70% of the Q4 advance in output came from a temporary collapse in imports, while business investment remained subdued and consumers spent more cautiously.\"\n\nThursday's much-anticipated Bank of England meeting was a far less knife-edge affair than markets expected. The Monetary Policy Committee voted 7 to 2 for steady policy, whereas interest rate futures were evenly split between a cut or the overnight base rate staying at 0.75 per cent. At least economists can take a bow as only 16 of the 61 surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a rate cut. Of course, leaving markets thinking your interest rate meeting is a coin toss does not speak well about the central bank's efforts at communication.\n\nThe MPC's decision lifted the pound towards $1.31 (a climb that began just before the statement was announced, again, not a good look), and attention will now focus on the upcoming March budget and just how much fiscal stimulus beckons from the government.\n\nFor advocates of an \"insurance\" rate cut, the final insult came when the MPC lowered its outlook for the UK economy and estimated an average rate of 1.1 per cent over the next three years. Hardly an upbeat view as Brexit looms on Friday.\n\nDean Turner at UBS Wealth Management notes:\n\n\"Economic data has been mixed, but there has been some speculation around the prospect of a post-election bounce. Recovering activity reduces the need for a rate cut for the time being. In our view, the economy is likely to run into further challenges this year and therefore we still expect the Bank of England to cut rates at some point in the next six months to give the economy additional support.\"\n\nIndeed, the BoE has stepped away from indicating a gradual tightening stance, leaving the door open to an easing in the coming months.\n\nSilvia Dall'Angelo at Hermes Investment Management said:\n\n\"A rate cut is still pretty much on the table and will be deployed in coming meetings if the pick-up in economic activity suggested by recent surveys does not materialise.\"\n\nFor now, she believes the BoE \"is saving its limited ammunition for when it might be more needed, also depending on how negotiations with the EU develop\".\n\nAs for life outside the EU, Dhaval Joshi at BCA Research predicts another round of Brexit tension looming for UK assets before the year-end. As Dhaval explained over tea and cake earlier this week, the playbook has been one of \"a gradual ratcheting up of tension ahead of a hard deadline to focus minds and force progress\".\n\nFor the pound and UK assets, this likely entails better progress later in the year or, as Dhaval, says: \"A 'fudged resolution' at the eleventh hour in which both sides blink -- because neither side is prepared to go over the cliff edge.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Researchers point to Saudi Arabia. In June 2018, Ben Hubbard, a New York Times reporter covering Saudi Arabia, received a text in Arabic that read: \"Ben Hubbard and the story of the Saudi royal family,\" that linked to arabnews365.com.

"title": "Hong Kong says radical protesters are plotting bombing campaign", "body": "The Hong Kong government has privately warned diplomats it is bracing for a bombing campaign by radical pro-democracy protesters as the territory enters its 10th month of demonstrations.\n\nCarrie Lam, the city's chief executive, has told at least one western diplomat that bombings are likely and that her administration was on high alert following police seizures of homemade bombs and materials as well as other weapons in recent months.\n\nHer concerns have been repeated by John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, and Chris Tang, commissioner of the Hong Kong police, in meetings with western diplomats. They have warned of expected attacks using improvised explosive devices, guns and homemade bombs.\n\nA sustained bombing campaign targeting police and the Beijing-backed government would be a dangerous escalation for a protest movement that began with enormous peaceful marches but has grown increasingly confrontational.\n\nPolice on Tuesday said they had found three IEDs within 48 hours, including a homemade bomb that exploded in a toilet at Caritas Medical Centre. No one was hurt in the blast, which damaged a toilet cubicle. The city's security bureau said the IEDs were related to protests against perceived inaction by the government over the new coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"Despite three different locations and three different types of devices, all had the potential to cause serious injury or death,\" said Alick McWhirter, Hong Kong police's senior bomb disposal officer.\n\nPolice said they were still investigating the motive for the hospital attack and whether it was linked to the protests. No one has been arrested.\n\nIn interviews with the Financial Times late last year, a handful of individuals active in the protest movement admitted they were planning more serious attacks on police.\n\n\"We've been trying to figure out how to make a bomb since Molotovs don't really hurt the police enough,\" one protester, who asked not to be identified, told the FT.\n\n\"We have a very large group of around 50 people and we have consensus that we should try to plant a bomb.\"\n\nHong Kong is suffering its worst political crisis since its handover from the UK to China in 1997, sparked by an attempt to introduce legislation that would have allowed people to be extradited to the mainland.\n\nDemonstrators' demands have widened to include an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality and universal suffrage, with opinion polls showing increased public support for the use of violence in protests.\n\n\"We are at the cusp of a modest insurgency, basically an extreme breakout like the Real IRA or the INLA,\" said Steve Vickers, a former head of the colonial era Royal Hong Kong Police's criminal intelligence bureau who now runs a risk consultancy. He was referring to the Real Irish Republican Army and the Irish National Liberation Army, paramilitary groups that were active at the height of Northern Ireland's sectarian violence.\n\n\"It stems from deep frustration and what they see as lack of progress,\" said Mr Vickers.\n\nHe added that as the protest movement lost momentum, a fringe element of hardcore protesters was becoming increasingly radicalised.\n\nHong Kong police last week arrested four people who they alleged were plotting to cause \"injury and chaos\".\n\nThree men and one woman, who were detained for \"conspiracy to manufacture explosives\" and \"conspiracy to wound with intent\", were arrested in relation to the discovery of a plot to build remote-controlled bombs last month. Police also seized knives and imitation guns.\n\nThe discovery followed a series of raids in recent months that have yielded petrol bombs, other radio-controlled IEDs, a Glock pistol, bullets and an AR-15 rifle. A search of a warehouse building in July found 2kg of powerful explosive TATP.\n\nMs Lam's office said it did not comment on speculative reports.\n\nThe Hong Kong police said: \"Police have not given such message of expected bomb attacks to any foreign diplomat or consulate.\"\n\nThe last concerted bombing campaign in Hong Kong was during leftist riots in the city in 1966 and 1967. That was blamed on communist insurgents inspired by China's cultural revolution.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

and barred entry to foreign nationals who had recently travelled to China, while Wall Street suffered one of its worst days of the year as concerns over the coronavirus outbreak continued to mount.\n\nA temporary order signed by President Donald Trump will prohibit foreign nationals -- aside from immediate family of US citizens and permanent residents -- who have travelled to China in the previous two weeks from entering the US.\n\nThe move came hours after health authorities imposed a mandatory quarantine for a group of Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the first such action in half a century.\n\nThe president's order was one of several measures, announced during a press conference at the White House, that US officials said were aimed at limiting the risks posed by the coronavirus. A seventh case of coronavirus in the US was confirmed in California on Friday.\n\nIn China, the centre of the outbreak, state TV said that 11,791 people had contracted the virus there and the number of deaths had risen to 259. Several other countries including the UK, Italy, Sweden, France and Australia have reported cases. In Hong Kong, schools will remain closed until March.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency on Thursday.\n\nBig airlines have said they will suspend all flights between the US and China. American Airlines said it was halting services beginning on Friday. Fellow US carriers United Airlines and Delta Air Lines will cancel services starting next week.\n\nUS officials said that any flights that do come in from China would be limited to seven airports, including John F Kennedy in New York, Chicago O'Hare and Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nAlex Azar, US secretary of health and human services, said that the current risk to the American public remained low. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the government's goal was to \"keep it that way\".\n\nUS investors joined in a wave of selling on global equity markets on Friday, as concern grew about the rapid spread of coronavirus and its potential impact on the world economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 1.8 per cent for its worst one-day performance since October, closing out its worst month since August. Shares in technology and travel groups -- seen as vulnerable to economic fallout in China -- once again posted sharp losses. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.6 per cent.\n\nGold, considered a safe haven for investors, rose 1 per cent to hit levels last seen in April 2013. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, settled 0.2 per cent lower at $58.16 a barrel.\n\n\"Although we continue to believe markets will eventually look past the virus, stock prices may not stabilise until the number of reported coronavirus cases plateaus, which may still be weeks or months from now,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise global market strategist, noting that traders \"took a more guarded approach to close out the week\".\n\nMr Azar said American citizens returning to the US who have travelled to Hubei province in the previous 14 days would be subject to as many as two weeks under quarantine. Citizens who have been to other areas in mainland China would undergo health screenings at ports of entry and up to two weeks of monitored self-quarantine.\n\nFourteen days is believed to be the incubation period during which individuals can transmit the virus before showing symptoms.\n\nAll of the travel measures announced by the Trump administration will take effect on Sunday at 5pm Eastern time.\n\nAlso on Friday, the CDC imposed a two-week mandatory quarantine for all 195 passengers who were evacuated on a flight from Wuhan that arrived in the US earlier this week.", "source": {"uri":

Most airlines are offering refunds or rebooking on to different flights.\n\nThe large number of cancelled flights, combined with travel restrictions into and out of affected areas, means many travel policies could pay out.\n\n\"Travel insurers are bracing themselves for a lot of claims,\" said Michelle Crorie, a partner at law firm Clyde & Co. \"Travel looks like it will be paying out most at the moment.\"\n\nThe travel insurance industry has responded by reminding customers they should look elsewhere in the first instance. An advisory notice issued by Allianz this week said airlines should refund the cost of cancelled flights, while credit card providers might also offer coverage for losses. After that, it said, customers should look at \"the terms and conditions of their travel insurance policy\".\n\nCompanies and events affected by the outbreak are also likely to be looking to their insurance.\n\nCalifornia-based Metabiota tracks the impact of viruses on individual behaviour, such as people's willingness to travel. Its modelling suggests the impact of the coronavirus outbreak could be similar to the Sars virus in 2003, when some hotels suffered a 40 per cent drop in revenues.\n\nAccording to Metabiota chief executive, Nita Madhav, Sars caused overall economic losses of more than $50bn.\n\nThe World Athletics Indoor Championships, which was due to be held in China next month, has already been postponed and there are fears that many other sports events, such as the Formula 1 race due to be held in Shanghai in April, will have to be cancelled.\n\nBut the question of whether insurance will cover these costs is likely to be contentious as insurance companies, policyholders and lawyers pore over the meaning of specific clauses in contracts.\n\n\"Lots of policies have had exclusions placed in them in the last 10 years due to [insurers'] experience with flu-type outbreaks,\" said Ms Crorie.\n\nIn some cases there will be clauses that allow customers to make claims if the disruption was caused by some sort of government action, such as transport closures.\n\nCompanies that have bought more general commercial insurance policies will also have to scour the details. Cover for the costs of business interruption is available, but is usually linked to property damage. So-called non-damage business interruption cover -- which might cover the impact of an epidemic or pandemic -- is available, but not commonly bought.\n\n\"It is towards the rare end of the spectrum,\" said Ms Franks. \"There needs to be a lot of analysis about what the clients need. It's for the more sophisticated buyers.\"\n\nLife insurers will also be affected as the death toll rises. Many of them buy their own cover against what are known as \"extreme mortality\" events such as pandemics, said Franck Pinette, global head of life and health at broker Willis Re. In areas such as Europe, this has been driven by regulations that force insurers to hold capital for pandemic risk.\n\n\"Some companies have extreme mortality cover to reduce their capital requirements,\" said Mr Pinette, although he added that life insurers in Asia had been less enthusiastic buyers of that sort of cover. \"You talk to some risk managers in life insurance companies who think it will never happen.\"\n\nNevertheless, insurers' interest in the causes and consequences of pandemics has grown over the past two decades as they assess the impact of outbreaks such as Sars.\n\nCatastrophe-modelling agency, RMS, which made its name modelling extreme weather risks, has started to look at the spread of pandemics. \"We have scenarios which cover the characteristics of what we are seeing in China,\" said Maria Lomelo, director of RMS LifeRisks. \"It captures the susceptible population, the number of people who could be infected and the number of deaths.\"",

"My travels through a China in lockdown", "body": "On the eve of Chinese New Year, I set off from Beijing for my grandparents' home in northern China. It is the day after the city of Wuhan has in effect been placed under quarantine. I am headed some 600km from Wuhan, but this New Year holiday is very different: almost everyone on the train from Beijing is wearing a face mask. I take mine off when I arrive at my grandparents' crowded flat, where they, along with a total of seven aunts, uncles and cousins, are already folding dumplings for the pot.\n\nThey are chatting about the virus outbreak, but the mood is still calm: everyone is busy dealing with a more immediate concern: making dinner for a large family. So far, only Wuhan has taken city-wide preventive measures, but we are now discussing our own. To some relief, my grandparents announce they are cancelling our usual visits to relatives.\n\nTraditionally, the eve and first day of the New Year holiday are reserved for immediate family: parents, children, grandparents. Then, on the subsequent days of the week-long break, the elders stay at home while the younger generations visit more distant relatives.\n\nIn my case these are the great-aunts, the second cousins twice removed, whom I might see once a year. I know very few of their names, but that is normal: in Chinese families, everyone is addressed according to what relation they are. If you can't remember the exact relation, then \"auntie\" or \"uncle\" will do. Fei Xiaotong, an anthropologist of rural China, famously argued that using names was an urban invention, only necessary for those who had not grown up in the same village.\n\nThere are dozens to pay respects to. In my father's generation, before China's one-child policy was enforced in the 1980s, rural families were large -- all the better to help on the farm. Nearly everyone has since left the farm. At New Year I meet my uncles, the university-educated bureaucrats working in big cities, and my father's cousins, who are construct\u00adion workers and truck drivers flung across China. Almost everyone in my father's generation left to pursue work in the cities, and so this is the one time in the year they gather together.\n\nSome families, like mine, are ambitious in their itineraries: on the second day of the holiday, my father and uncles would usually pack in visits to six aunts' and uncles' homes and be back at my grandparents' in time for lunch. This year, there were to be no such visits.\n\nLike me, some travellers managed to reach home before transport links started shutting down, and are at least holed up with loved ones. But for late travellers, those who cancelled travel plans out of fear of contagion and transport disruption, let alone the 9m people stuck in Wuhan, the situation is far worse. For many in China, the New Year is the only time in the year they see their parents and even their children.\n\nChina is a country of long-distance internal migrants: go back one or two generations, and most people's families were subsistence farmers living in the countryside. Over the past 50 years, a vast rural-urban migration has spread those families across the country. Those who are lucky enough to go to university often settle down in the big cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and smaller provincial capitals. Those who don't settle in the cities go everywhere as migrant workers fuelling the low-paid casual labour of China's economic development. Because the government makes it very difficult for migrant workers to access education in the cities, many leave their children with relatives in the countryside, and visit them at New Year.\n\nSo Chinese New Year is a crucial annual migration that is easier for some than for others. Rail tickets sell out quickly, and those with the money might buy plane tickets instead. Many migrant workers travel by long-distance bus -- the same services that multiple provinces have since suspended in the wake of the virus outbreak. One of my father's cousins drives for three days or more, covering 4,000km each way.\n\nMy journey from Beijing was made simpler 15 years ago, after my grandparents left their old farmstead in favour of an apartment in the nearby town with hot water and the company of my urbanised aunt and uncles. On the first day of the holiday, we make plans to visit the old farmstead the next day, to sweep my great-grandma's grave and light firecrackers for her.\n\nI like visiting the old village, but it is increasingly deserted. The old farmsteads are as they were in my father's childhood: a square courtyard surrounded by single-storey rooms on each side, without any heating. By law, my father's relatives are entitled to a portion of the farmland in the village, but they have mostly leased their plots to companies, which farm on a mass scale. One of my father's few cousins who stayed in the countryside used to make his living not from farming, but from making traps: when I visited his cold farmhouse on a previous New Year holiday, he pulled a live Siberian weasel out of a sack.\n\nOn the evening we are making plans to visit the village, Beijing announces it will stop long-distance buses going into the city. The next morning, we wake to the news that our county has started asking its villages to block their road entrances, and that public bus services from the city are being suspended. Across China, other friends tell me of villages and townships embarking on self-quarantine in the national spirit of viral defence.\n\nMuch of it may be over-zealous, as there is an ongoing debate over the effectiveness of government-imposed city-level quarantines: borders are always leaky, and quarantines give possible viral carriers a reason to lie about their whereabouts. In my grandparents' old village of some 500 people, there have been no coronavirus victims to date, and some 70 detected infections in a province of 80m people.\n\nAs the news landscape shifts, my relatives now discuss preventive measures with more urgency than before.\n\nBut news of spurious quality proliferates both online and offline. One of my uncles recommends that we all chew garlic to stave off the virus. As he describes the idea, I recognise it as coming from a much-shared article on WeChat, China's main social-messaging platform and incubator of various unreliable articles over the viral outbreak. There are a few peer-reviewed studies on the possible antiviral properties of garlic, but I doubt the author or sharers of that article had gone to the trouble of looking them up. More pernicious rumours floated on the Chinese internet, such as the old rumour that Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) had been manufactured by the US to specifically target Chinese people.\n\nThe English-language internet is hardly much better: an old video of a street protest is recirculated as if happening now in Wuhan (untrue), and a video of Wuhan with firecrackers going off in the background is flaunted as evidence of police shooting people trying to leave (also untrue). Much social media commentary is overlaid with disgust at Chinese people as a racial group and over their eating habits.\n\nThe worst part of the outbreak, for many of my friends, is the terrifying headlines they feel compelled to consume about it, which leave you feeling powerless and panicked. On social media, some share tips of varying helpfulness for staying safe, while others share a petition to extend the national holiday, or even lists of places in Beijing where virus victims are said to be staying. Some simply wish their friends were well, and hope we stay calm. Out of the dozens of articles I've read about the virus, I can only condense one helpful piece of advice: wash your hands properly and dry them on clean towels.\n\nOn my second morning at my grandparents', my uncle suggests that I go back to Beijing early, fearing more transport options would be shut down as the holiday went on. I pack my suitcase quickly, glad that the load is lightened by the presents I've offloaded.\n\nBut I have forgotten to reckon with the customary food parcels from my aunt. The next morning, as I leave for Beijing, she hands me a heavy bag packed with northern Chinese staples: steamed buns stuffed with sweet bean paste, salted duck eggs, breaded cabbage, deep-fried meatballs, and an entire cooked rooster. She thrusts on me another bag filled with a dozen pink apples and a dozen oranges, saying I can eat them on the way. I am running out of hands to carry it all.\n\n\"It's a three-hour train ride,\" I reply, laughing, \"I can't eat that many oranges in three hours.\"\n\n\"Well, you can eat them in Beijing!\"\n\n\"Beijing is a big city. Beijing has oranges,\" I say, leaving the second bag behind.\n\nMy uncle's friend drives us to the railway station, as the local buses have been suspended. As we pull in to the station, he reminds us: \"Put on your masks -- I hear they're not letting people in without them.\"\n\nOn the way home, I message friends on WeChat, telling them I'm returning early. The responses I get back range from anxiety to boredom. Two ask me if any of the attendees of a group hiking trip I organised a week ago had recently been to Wuhan. A few more, also unexpectedly stuck in Beijing, urge me to organise another hiking trip to relieve the holiday humdrum. Two others invite me to their dinner parties, joking that Chinese grain liquor will help disinfect our throats.\n\nI hesitate for hours before replying, wondering whether a yes or no would be overly cautious, rude or irresponsible. How are you meant to assess the risk of going to see friends, when you're probably more likely to be killed from a traffic accident on the way there than from the coronavirus, yet people around you are panicking?\n\nBack in Beijing, the city streets are emptier than they usually are in the new year's holiday week. But there are reassuring signs of normal life: I brush past green-coated guards still marching in formation around the embassy district, now with face masks on. Through a restaurant window, I see a few people eating Beijing barbeque skewers. And on the streets, the city's migrant workers are still busy: delivering, cleaning, hurrying everywhere.\n\nWhen I arrive at my apartment block, the guard at the gate to the compound hands me a pink slip of paper from the local district government. It tells us to register ourselves if we have been to coronavirus-infected areas, to wear masks outside and to keep warm. \"We can't cut corners on preventive measures,\" the paper reads, \"but we also don't need to panic.\"\n\nThe next morning, I venture out for groceries. In the cramped convenience store on my block, I am the only customer, but there are bags filled with other people's groceries standing on the till. As I enter, a delivery man dressed in blue electric-scooter gear is leaving.\n\n\"I'm afraid we're mostly out of fresh vegetables,\" the shopkeeper says, seeing me enter. I'll have to walk a bit further to a larger supermarket to get mine. \"We've had very few customers in person, but we're getting all these delivery requests,\" she adds. As she explains, her smartphone's loudspeaker blares out another order. This shop, like most small shops in big cities, has understocked for the New Year holiday, expecting a dearth of customers.\n\n\"We plan to restock in a week, but really, I don't think the shipments will come through for another two weeks,\" she says.\n\n\"Where do you get your food from?\" I ask, thinking of the farmland around Beijing and the villages that have sealed off their roads.\n\n\"Where it's produced,\" she replies, flatly, as if speaking of places that do not need to be spoken of.\n\nDevelopment economists have theorised that urbanisation can happen only when agricultural productivity rises above subsistence levels -- that is, when there is surplus food being produced in the countryside that can be sent to the cities. Cities do not support their own life; farms do. For every farmer's son who leaves for the city, a problem arises: how do you send them their lunch? After her youngest brothers went to secondary school, my aunt would sometimes walk the five kilometres into town to deliver them steamed buns made from homegrown wheat.\n\nWhen my father left the countryside for university in the early 1980s, 20 per cent of China's population lived in cities, according to government figures. That has now reached roughly 60 per cent. China's highways and food logistics networks have developed accordingly. The food is mostly driven and delivered by migrant workers from the countryside -- a class of people likely to be unable or unwilling to return to work because now they can't get back to the cities. They are also more likely to be in poor health and to lack access to healthcare.\n\nBack in the convenience store, another blue-jacketed delivery man runs in to pick up a bag of groceries. I consider trying to stop him for a quick interview on how online delivery services are enjoying a peak in demand, but I decide against it: delivery people work one of the most high-pressure jobs in the digital economy, rushing from door to door, and their performance is timed to the second by the apps that dictate their schedules. If I want to speak to them, I'll have to catch them off shift.\n\nI fish out a couple of apples from a small crate on the shop floor. I wish I had taken my aunt's oranges.\n\nYuan Yang is the FT's China tech correspondent in Beijing", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [],

international emergency over the new coronavirus epidemic -- a decision many experts regarded as overdue, as the number of confirmed cases rose close to the total of 8,100 people worldwide who fell ill during the Sars outbreak in 2003.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said: \"The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries. Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it.\"\n\nDeclaring a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) is an important symbolic step, signalling how seriously the world takes the epidemic of respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus nCoV. In practical terms, it becomes easier for the WHO to co-ordinate the responses of governments around the world.\n\nUnder International Health Regulations, to which all 196 member states are committed, WHO can require specific measures at ports, airports and ground crossings to limit the spread of infection, while preventing \"unwarranted travel and trade restrictions so that disruption is kept to a minimum.\"\n\nAt present, Dr Tedros said, \"WHO opposes any restrictions on travel and trade against China.\" He praised Chinese efforts to control the coronavirus as \"very impressive -- beyond words.\"\n\n\"Let me be clear,\" he added, \"this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China. On the contrary, the WHO continues to have confidence in China's capacity to control the outbreak.\"\n\nAccording to the latest WHO figures, which lag a little behind unofficial counts, 7,818 cases of nCoV have been confirmed worldwide, of which 82 were outside China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau.\n\nIn China 1,370 people are severely ill and 170 have died. There are also 12,167 suspected cases -- suggesting that the confirmed toll will continue to rise sharply over the next few days at least.\n\nDr Tedros urged people to beware rumours. \"This is the time for facts, not fear,\" he said. \"This is the time for science, not rumours. This is the time for solidarity, not stigma.\"\n\nPublic health experts outside the WHO praised the decision, which they said was overdue. Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome, the London-based medical charity, said: \"Declaration of an international emergency will undoubtedly sharpen governments' focus on protecting citizens. But we must also step up as an international community to make sure no one is left behind -- with all interventions, including public health measures, diagnostics, treatments and vaccines available to everyone.\n\n\"This will challenge the best-resourced countries but will have disproportionate impact on fragile health systems in low- and middle-income countries,\" Dr Farrar added. \"A global epidemic of a rapid-spreading novel respiratory virus like this, which has crossed from animals to humans, is something warned of for many years. It is also a stark reminder of how vulnerable we are to epidemics of infectious diseases known and unknown.\"\n\nThomas Cueni, director-general of the International Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, said the declaration would \"serve not only to signal to the need for epidemic preparedness, it will also serve to further galvanise global collaboration with the private and public sector that will be required to develop vaccines and treatments needed.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

traders for harbingers of recession, has become inverted again as the intensifying coronavirus outbreak revived fears of a global growth slowdown.\n\nFor the first time since October, the yield on three-month US Treasury bills jumped above that on the benchmark 10-year note. An inversion of this portion of the yield curve -- which charts yields on debt of different maturities -- has preceded every recession of the last half century.\n\nThe gap widened to as much as minus 3.9 basis points on Thursday after the yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 1.5 per cent.\n\nFearing the economic damage from the fast-spreading coronavirus, investors eschewed global equities and sought the relative safety of government debt, sending yields, which move inversely to price, lower.\n\nThe death toll climbed to 170 people on Thursday, with more than 7,700 people sickened in mainland China. Adding to angst in the US, the Centers for Disease Control confirmed the first case in the country of person-to-person transmission of the virus, adding to the five Americans who have already been diagnosed.\n\n\"Every morning we have a new number that seems to be double the previous number and that gets people on edge and gets people wondering\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009how many more millions of people will be quarantined?\" said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nAccording to James Sweeney, chief economist and chief investment officer for the Americas at Credit Suisse, the impact on growth is likely to be sizeable.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this poses a substantial downside risk to Chinese growth immediately and global growth in the next few months,\" he warned.\n\nMillions in China have been quarantined, businesses shuttered and holidays extended to contain the outbreak. Airlines have halted flights, and the UK Foreign Office has joined others in warning against all but essential travel to China. Also on Thursday, Russia shut its land border with its south-eastern neighbour.\n\nThe US Treasury yield curve inverted on several occasions last year for the first time since the global financial crisis as trade tensions between the US and China frayed. The Federal Reserve responded to global growth concerns then by slashing US interest rates by a cumulative 75 basis points between July and October.\n\nJay Powell, Fed chairman, said at a news conference on Wednesday that the central bank was \"carefully monitoring\" the outbreak and its impact on the economic outlook, adding that \"there will clearly be implications at least in the near term for Chinese output\".\n\nJim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, said the raging public health crisis could prompt a similar reaction from the central bank.\n\n\"Coronavirus has replaced the trade war as the Fed's primary unknown, and makes them err on the side of easing,\" he said.\n\nAccording to David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, that may not be the only reason to think the Fed will cut rates further this year.\n\n\"The more likely candidate for a rate cut sooner rather than later would be continued downward pressure on inflation,\" he said, adding that Mr Powell sent a very dovish signal when he said the central bank is not comfortable with inflation running persistently below its 2 per cent target, as it has been.\n\nSince the start of the year, traders have become convinced there will be one cut by the Fed this year and have sharply increased their bets on two, according to futures prices compiled by Bloomberg.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type":

funds are still searching for the next big thing", "body": "Stock markets are not making life easy for hedge funds. The discomfort looks likely to continue for some time.\n\nJanuary had been shaping up quite nicely for equity-focused managers until a widespread market sell-off, sparked by the coronavirus outbreak, eroded much of their gains. Such funds were up just 0.2 per cent to Tuesday, according to data group HFR.\n\nManagers find themselves in a dilemma. In runaway market rallies such as this one, they feel investors give them little credit for picking out overvalued stocks. To a much greater extent than in previous bull runs, share prices are often supported by central bank stimulus. That keeps borrowing costs low, sustaining risky business models.\n\nBut bear markets present dangers too. Managers can be lured into taking on too many bets on rising stocks, particularly if the good times last as long as they have, only to find they offer investors little protection when share indices fall. This happened in 2018 when hedge funds underperformed in a falling market.\n\nThe same may have happened this month: equity hedge funds' net bets on rising stocks -- after subtracting \"short\" positions, where they bet on prices falling -- were running close to their highest levels of the previous 12 months, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAt the heart of the problem is a lack of strong trading themes, which throw up stocks to short. Unlike the dotcom bust of the early 2000s, which offered a perfect opportunity to bet on falling tech stocks, or the subprime crisis -- targeted by a smart few -- attractive short trades have been few and far between.\n\nThe demise of the high street retail sector has offered some opportunities, and the UK's exit from the EU on Friday might do so too, although Brexit has so far been a frustrating trade for hedge funds.\n\nBut in general, trying to find profitable shorts has been hard going. Lansdowne Partners, one of Europe's biggest hedge funds, told investors in its European Absolute Opportunities fund this month that its top 10 losing positions last year had all been short bets, according to a letter seen by the Financial Times. Investors have been voting with their feet.

The 10-day moving average volume of Vix call options -- derivatives that allow traders to benefit from a spike in turbulence -- has increased from 200,000 traded at the start of January to about 400,000.\n\nThe Vix itself has climbed from a low of about 12 points in mid-January to over 18 on Thursday, when the S&P 500 index was off by 0.7 per cent by midday in New York.\n\nThere are many negative factors \"that are screaming for a big stock sell-off\", said Stephen Aniston, president of vixcontango.com, a volatility trading analytics provider.\n\nActivity in put options linked to the US stock market, which offer investors protection against equities slumping, has also been rising in recent weeks as the spreading coronavirus and the approaching US presidential election has investors on edge.\n\nTrading in S&P 500 put options has climbed to levels not seen since September. The 10-day moving average for put volume on the S&P 500 has gone from 720,000 at the start of January to 920,000, again the highest since October.\n\nTraders said the flurry of hedging activity is similar to October 2018, when Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell's remarks on interest rate increases and \"quantitative tightening\" rattled the market, and also in February 2018, when Vix-linked funds hit trouble.\n\nA slide in government bond yields and a rise in gold prices are further signs of investors' sharpened appetite for safe assets, traders noted. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield sank to a four-month low below 1.55 per cent on Thursday, while gold has nudged above $1,580 a troy ounce.\n\nThe upcoming US presidential election has also prompted some investors to buy insurance against market declines. Senator Bernie Sanders recently surpassed former US vice-president Joe Biden in a poll on the popular political betting site PredictIt for the first time, just days ahead of the first caucus for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nA Deutsche Bank poll indicated that 90 per cent of clients thought that a victory for Mr Sanders would be negative for the US stock market. The left-leaning US senator from Vermont is now in the lead with a 39 per cent chance of winning the Democratic nomination, according to bets on PredictIt. Data gathered by Real Clear Politics has him ahead in Iowa, which casts the first votes of the 2020 campaign next week.\n\n\"The market is going to start to price in some serious probability of a leftwing Democratic win, which will hit stocks quite a bit,\" Mr Aniston said.\n\nInvestors are also worried that underwhelming corporate profits will unsettle the stock market, given how far and fast it rallied over the past year. \"We now see the market fully valued, particularly within US equities.

facility.\n\n\"The flight will continue on to Spain following the stopover in the UK, at which point EU nationals' home countries will take responsibility for them,\" the British Foreign &

Wuhan on Tuesday while Japan has conducted two evacuation flights.\n\nThe number of British nationals boarding the flight was fewer than originally expected, witnesses said. Diplomats said there were 300 British nationals in Wuhan while 200 had registered for the flight on Thursday.\n\nThose hoping to leave the stricken city have been prevented from doing so for the past week because of roadblocks, a ban on public transport and the closure of the city's airport.\n\nBritish evacuees boarding the flight were asked to sign a document pledging they would remain at a National Health Service facility for two weeks.\n\nBut they claimed the government did not inform them what the conditions would be like or the location of the facility.\n\n\"The media gets the information before we do,\" complained one evacuee, Patrick Brogan, a British tourist in Wuhan.\n\nJapanese and US officials have said those returning from Wuhan would be allowed to self-quarantine if they did not display symptoms.\n\nBy contrast, Canberra said it would isolate its citizens evacuated from Wuhan on Christmas Island, 2,100 miles north-west of Australia.\n\nMr Brogan said earlier he would have to leave his Chinese girlfriend behind because Beijing was only allowing Britons on the flight.\n\n\"I'm pleased [to be leaving], but also sad to leave my girlfriend behind,\" he said, before adding: \"I would prefer to know the details of what will happen [on arrival].\"\n\nOther evacuees seeking to board the flight included Veronica Theobald.

virus.\n\n\"We are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread,\" he said. \"We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately.\n\n\"All developed health services that have had cases have managed to prevent and avoid transmission.\"\n\nThe government is advising anyone who has been to the Chinese province of Wuhan, where the outbreak started, to self-isolate for 14 days regardless of whether they have symptoms. Anyone returning from elsewhere in China should self-isolate if they experience symptoms, however minor.\n\nThe two confirmed cases were confirmed and transferred to a specialist unit overnight. According to Public Health England, there are two principal high consequence infections disease centres in England -- at the Royal Free Hospital in London and the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.\n\nProf Whitty gave no details about the two patients, including their current condition or where they were taken to Newcastle from.\n\nIt is not known how many people those infected with the virus have been in contact with. Sharon Peacock, national infection service director at Public Health England said an outbreak investigation team had been deployed immediately to identify those who had been involved in the cases.\n\nThe mortality rate of the virus is estimated at about 2 per cent, compared with 20-30 per cent for the Mers virus, which emerged in 2012, and 10 per cent for Sars, which emerged in 2004.\n\nThere have so far been 9,692 reported cases in China and 213 deaths, Beijing confirmed. There has been no sustained transmission of the virus or deaths outside China.\n\nProf Whitty said the UK government had increased its threat level for coronavirus from low to moderate as a result of the global situation and that the change had \"nothing to do with increased cases coming in\" to the UK.\n\nA government-chartered aeroplane carrying 83 British citizens from Wuhan was due to land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Friday afternoon. The passengers will be quarantined for two weeks at a medical facility on the Wirral, Merseyside.\n\nThe World Health Organization on Thursday declared an international emergency over the epidemic because of the \"potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it\", according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general.\n\nAt present, the transmission rate for the coronavirus outbreak is 2.5-3, meaning each infected person on average passes the disease to 2.5-3 people. Chinese authorities are working to reduce the transmission rate to 1, at which point the epidemic will have peaked.\n\nProf Whitty said it would become clear \"in the next few weeks\" if the outbreak in China would be brought under control, during which time the government would be focused on treating and limiting the spread of a small number of cases of the virus in the UK.\n\nIf the rate of transmission does not fall within China, however, the virus would be likely to spread globally, presenting a greater risk.
