The 400 police at the 35 checkpoints in a so-called \"red zone\" of 10 Lombardy towns are reported to have stopped five attempted escapes so far. Essential supplies of food and medicine are allowed in but no one else is allowed to visit the affected towns. While individuals can leave their homes, they are not to go to school or work. Public gatherings are banned.\n\n\"I went from spending my days at the shop, chatting everyday with friends who stop to say hi, going for a coffee at the nearby cafe, to seeing my town completely shocked and scared by the death from the virus,\" said Ms Biasio on the phone. \"And then the lockdown happened.\" The 46-year-old has now been forced to shut up shop.\n\nHome to one of the largest coronavirus outbreaks outside of Asia, Italy is reeling from the political and economic ramifications of trying to contain the virus. Authorities have closed schools and universities, businesses have shut down, football matches and fashion shows have been cancelled.\n\nThe outbreak has shut the door on opposition hopes for fresh national elections. Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigration League, has blamed Italy's open borders for the spread of the virus and attacked the government for not doing enough. At the same time, infections have begun to pop up elsewhere in Europe. Spanish authorities have put a hotel in Tenerife under quarantine and schools in Vienna have been closed as concern has rippled out across the continent.\n\nThe lockdown in a small cluster of towns in Italy's north, the first communities to be put under quarantine in Europe, offers a glimpse of what could happen should the coronavirus spread.\n\nThe transformation from normality to quarantine was rapid.\n\nLast Friday, Italian authorities announced that six people had tested positive for the virus in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. Later that night, a person from V\u00f2 died. By Sunday the Italian government had imposed a quarantine on 10 towns in Lombardy, and also V\u00f2. More than 400 people now have the virus and 12 Italians, all elderly and all from the north, have died from the virus. The Italian authorities are still unclear how the outbreak started, and why it has been severe in these towns.\n\nFor people in V\u00f2, the fact that they are now on the global map for coronavirus has come as a shock. There is a stigma to being under quarantine, said Linda Ambrosi, a V\u00f2 resident, on the phone. \"We are just regular people who have found themselves having to give up their daily habits overnight. We can't go to work, our routine has been upended, and we have been labelled as infected or contagious,\" said Ms Ambrosi.\n\n\"We are isolated from the rest of the country,\" said Roberto Cighetti, a high school teacher in Codogno, a town which is also under lockdown. \"We are stuck here with our families and are not allowed to leave. Trains do not even stop in our town and the surrounding areas anymore.\" For now, supermarkets and pharmacies are receiving regular supplies, he said on the phone, with many shop staff wearing masks.\n\nCodogno officials have set up a radio station -- dubbed \"adio red zone\" by locals -- in the basement of a youth centre to broadcast updates on the situation. Initially, most people were concerned about their health, Mr Cighetti said. But increasingly they are concerned about the economic impact.\n\nErik Granzon, a 37-year-old from V\u00f2 who runs a fireworks business, estimates he has already lost \u20ac250,000 in sales from the quarantine. \"There's nothing you can do, the army itself prevents us from leaving, we are all stuck and are facing big losses,\" he said on the phone, having just returned from being tested for coronavirus.\n\n\"As a business, we are still trying to figure out how to face the emergency, how to handle the losses and how to pay the staff. I'm afraid this could only be the beginning, I keep receiving calls from clients asking what is going to happen.\"\n\nMaria Vittoria Falchetti, a director at MTA, a car components manufacturer in Codogno, said the closure of its factory, which with 600 staff is the town's largest employer, could have an impact on some of the world's largest car manufacturers.\n\n\"We supply many of the largest car companies in the world, and we have weekly delivery schedules which have been heavily disrupted. If our customers cannot get their deliveries, then they will need to stop their production,\" she said on the phone.\n\nIn the face of this disruption, Angelo Caperdoni, mayor of Somaglia, another Lombardy town under quarantine, said residents are doing their best to get by. \"Residents can go shopping for food, and essential activities are carried out,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, for some, the time off has allowed them to do some of life's more pleasant activities, and even some neglected chores. \"If there's a silver lining to this situation, it's that I can spend more time with my two sons,\" said Ms Biasio. \"I can go for a walk and do some spring cleaning.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

counting the cost of the coronavirus outbreak, which is threatening the cancellation of this summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo while disrupting competitions around the world.\n\nThe spread of the virus has led to the postponement of football and rugby fixtures, golf tournaments and motor racing events in Asia and Europe that were due to be held in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We are still absolutely heading for the games on July 24,\" a spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee said on Wednesday, but added the games organisers are monitoring the situation alongside the World Health Organization and authorities in Japan and China before making any firm decisions.\n\nDick Pound, a senior member of the IOC, said this week the world's biggest sporting event was more likely to be cancelled than postponed, if health authorities deemed it too dangerous to proceed by late May.\n\n\"If it gets to be something like the Spanish flu,\" said Mr Pound, referring to the deadly pandemic early in the 20th century, \"at that level of lethality, then everybody's got to take their medicine\".\n\nEconomists and analysts in Tokyo said they had been inundated with requests from investors over the past 24 hours to calculate the financial impact on Japan of a postponement or outright cancellation of the summer Olympics.\n\nThe project has cost Japan $25bn, according to some estimates, and has broken records for corporate support with each of the games' 15 \"Gold\" sponsors, including Canon, Mizuho and Nomura, paying $100m for that status.\n\nKiichi Murashima, chief economist at Citi in Tokyo, said cancelling the games would reduce Japan's quarter-on-quarter GDP growth for the three months to September by 0.2 percentage points, or 0.8 percentage points on an annualised basis.\n\nHe based his estimate on the 2m expected inbound tourists for the games not coming to Japan. That theoretical blow would hit a Japanese economy that is deemed at risk of entering technical recession this year.\n\nAccording to a person familiar with early conversations,officials have begun discussing contingency plans, such as relocating Olympic competitions to multiple locations across the world. The IOC declined to comment.\n\nSuch a move could protect lucrative broadcasting contracts, particularly in the US, where even a short delay of a few weeks would clash with busy schedules for domestic sports leagues during the autumn.\n\nSome of the money spent organising large sporting events could be recouped through cancellation insurance. According to data from insurer Beazley, the 2014 football World Cup was covered by $1.25bn of event cancellation insurance, while the 2018 World Cup was insured for $1.5bn. Analysts at Jefferies believe that the Tokyo Olympics could be covered for about $2bn, with an extra $600m to cover hospitality and hotel bookings.\n\n\"Coronavirus is going to be pretty large for the property and casualty insurance industry,\" said Philip Kett, an analyst at Jefferies.\n\nMaking claims on the insurance policies is unlikely to be straightforward. The terms and conditions differ from policy to policy, as do the triggers that lead to payouts. In some cases, cancellation because of infectious disease could be excluded.\n\nThe IOC has an insurance policy designed to protect its revenues against \"force majeure\" events, although it has not been tested previously. Other Olympic Games events have only previously been cancelled during world wars.\n\nThe spread of coronavirus has forced the postponement of Formula One's Chinese Grand Prix, the Formula E electric car race in Sanya, on China's Hainan Island, the World Athletics Indoor Championships in Nanjing, European Tour golf competitions in Malaysia and China, as well as the suspension of football leagues in China, South Korea and Japan.\n\nThis coming weekend, Japan's largest baseball team, the Yomiuri Giants, will play its first game of the season in an empty Tokyo Dome stadium.\n\nOn Wednesday, an upcoming Six Nations rugby match in Dublin between Ireland and Italy was also pushed back.\n\nA recent outbreak in northern Italy has caused the postponement of several matches in Serie A, the country's top football league. On Thursday, a European tie between Italy's Inter Milan and Bulgaria's Ludogorets will go ahead at the home team's ground of San Siro, but will be played without spectators.\n\nThe moves will result in multimillion euro hits to sporting organisations, from football clubs and competition owners, due to the loss of match day revenues and the inability to fulfil broadcasting rights.\n\n\"It's a very fluid situation,\" said Ed Woodward, executive vice-chairman of Manchester United, the English Premier League side, when asked by Wall Street analysts about the spread of coronavirus this week.

seeking to worship at the holy cities of Mecca and Medina as the kingdom attempts to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus.\n\nThe government was \"suspending entry to the kingdom for the purpose of umrah and visiting the Prophet's Mosque temporarily\", the foreign ministry said on Thursday. Umrah is an Islamic pilgrimage that can be performed at any time of year.\n\nSome 8m Muslims perform it annually, with many preferring the holy month of Ramadan that starts this year in the last week of April.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia has in the past restricted pilgrims from some countries or regions with disease outbreaks, as in the case of Ebola in 2014, a worldwide ban appears to be unprecedented. It is unclear if the main Hajj pilgrimage, due to begin in July, will be affected by the latest restrictions.\n\nThe kingdom has not reported any confirmed cases of the coronavirus inside the country. But seven Saudi citizens who travelled to Iran were among the cases reported in neighbouring Kuwait and Bahrain, where dozens of infections have been confirmed.\n\nThe health ministry said it was co-ordinating with local authorities in these countries to treat the infected Saudi citizens there.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also suspended tourist visa entry from countries where the virus is spreading, the foreign ministry added in its statement.\n\nAs part of its tourism and economic diversification strategy, the Saudi government plans to increase the number of umrah pilgrims to 30m a year by 2030.\n\nThe annual pilgrimage to Mecca is among the biggest single gatherings of humanity. A record number of more than 3m pilgrims made the journey in 2012, although numbers have declined since as the government issued fewer visas.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Umrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masjid_an-Nabawi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al-Masjid an-Nabawi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan_(calendar_month)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ramadan (calendar month)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrimage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrimage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Saudi Arabia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fb0b424dc-5927-11ea-abe5-8e03987b7b20?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "eventUri": "eng-5552451", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 410}, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 410, "relevance": 76}, {"uri": "1463129404", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-27", "time": "11:33:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-27T11:33:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-27T11:32:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.572549045085907, "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/957bf9f6-594f-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc", "title": "Japan shuts all schools to combat spread of coronavirus", "body": "Every school in Japan will shut from Monday in an unprecedented move that will affect 13m pupils and leave parents scrambling to find childcare as the country steps up its fight against the coronavirus.\n\nPrime minister Shinzo Abe urged all schools to close -- a de facto order from the central government -- until the end of the spring break on April 8 in an attempt to reduce social contact and halt the spread of the virus.\n\nThe order brings Japan closer to total shutdown and will hit an economy already on the brink of recession as millions of parents are forced to take time off work to look after their children.\n\n\"We need to place top priority on the health and safety of our children, and take measures to stem the risk of many children and teachers becoming infected through gathering for long hours every day,\" Mr Abe said after a meeting of the government's antivirus task force on Thursday.\n\nHe said the next one to two weeks would be \"a critical phase\" on handling the epidemic, which has spread to dozens of countries and resulted in 2,801 deaths worldwide. Japan has switched to a policy of trying to slow and contain the coronavirus outbreak rather than attempting to keep it out altogether.\n\nJapan now has a total of 175 domestic cases of the virus spread across 19 prefectures. In many cases, the route of infection is unknown and government advisers believe domestic transmission is taking place. There are a further 14 cases of Japanese citizens who have been evacuated from Wuhan in China, the epicentre of the coronavirus.\n\nMr Abe's attempt to get ahead of the virus comes after criticism of his government's handling of the outbreak, which included a failed quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Japan let passengers return home only for a number to subsequently test positive for the virus.\n\nThis week, Mr Abe called for the cancellation of large-scale public events such as concerts and sports matches. He has also asked companies to use teleworking and staggered opening hours as much as possible.\n\nThe trading house Mitsubishi has told its entire Japanese workforce of 3,800 people to work from home. Shiseido, Dentsu and Panasonic have also required remote working at home for their staff in central Tokyo, but many other companies do not have systems in place to allow their staff to work remotely.\n\nThe guidance on Thursday did not appear to include children's daycare facilities, but the closure of schools is expected to cause chaos for working parents in a country where there is no culture of hiring nannies or babysitters.\n\nWithin an hour of Mr Abe announcing the closures, social media was filled with comments from parents panicking about whether they can go to work next week and questioning how effective the measure would be if offices remained open.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

cases, an expert panel warned, a day after global stocks suffered their worst session in two years on fears over the accelerating international spread of the disease.\n\nThe government panel said that the country's 160 confirmed cases were detected in more than 16 different prefectures and in numerous cases the source of the infection was not clear. This excluded cases from an infected cruise ship and Japanese evacuees from China.\n\n\"We are at the crossroads,\" Shigeru Omi, head of the Japan Community Health Care Organization and a former regional director for the World Health Organization, said on Tuesday. \"Local transmission is already going on.\"\n\nThe comments came after a spate of new virus cases outside China, including outbreaks in Italy and South Korea that dashed investor hopes that the epidemic was close to being contained.\n\nGlobally, the number of confirmed cases jumped to more than 80,000 on Tuesday, with 2,699 deaths.\n\nOn Tuesday, US stock futures rebounded slightly and most Asian markets steadied, although shares in China fell on nervousness over the government's recent handling of the outbreak. Futures trading pointed to gains of about 1 per cent when Wall Street opened on Tuesday.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 3.4 per cent on Monday, erasing all its gains for the year in its biggest slide since trade tensions rattled markets in February 2018. The FTSE All-World index lost 3 per cent.\n\nInvestors flocked to the safety of government debt, pushing the yield on the US 10-year Treasury bond down more than 10 basis points to 1.369 per cent, just above its record low, as expectations grew that the US Federal Reserve would be forced to cut interest rates by April.\n\nEnergy stocks led the stock market decline, driven by a weakening oil price, followed by technology shares. Transport stocks were also battered.\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded by tweeting that the virus was \"very much under control in the USA\", adding: \"Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\"\n\nEuropean bourses also sold off on Monday as UK stocks suffered their worst day for five years and Italy's MIB index dropped 5.4 per cent in its largest fall since 2016.\n\nJohanna Chua, chief Asia Pacific economist at Citi, said the \"situation remains fluid and headline sensitive with market participants monitoring the spread of infections in several countries/regions including Italy and the Middle East\".\n\nThe market turmoil began after Italy imposed a quarantine across at least 10 towns over the weekend in an effort to contain the biggest outbreak of the virus outside Asia, with 229 confirmed infections and seven deaths.\n\nSouth Korean authorities reported 231 new cases of the virus, bringing the total number of infections to 893. The government added it had put 7,000 troops under quarantine after 11 had tested positive for the virus.\n\nIran said there had been 12 deaths and 61 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country, a sharp rise from the eight fatalities and 43 infected patients it reported a day earlier. Despite the outbreak in Italy, EU authorities said there were no plans to suspend travel across the 26-country Schengen area of visa-free travel.\n\n\"We need to take this situation extremely seriously -- but we must not give in to panic and of course to disinformation,\" said Stella Kyriakides, the EU's health commissioner.\n\nThe expert panel in Japan recommended changing its strategy of keeping the infection out altogether to containing it and slowing its spread. It no longer made sense to test everybody who might have been exposed to the virus, they said, as doing so would overwhelm the healthcare system.\n\nInstead, Japan was asking anybody who felt ill to isolate themselves and said they should only seek medical help if they suffered severe symptoms.\n\n\"The biggest objective of our response from this point should be to control the speed of the infection's spread and minimise the number of deaths and people with severe symptoms,\" the panel said.\n\nThe panel said that the next one to two weeks would be decisive in preventing the spread of the virus.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

mitigate the impact of the largest outbreak of coronavirus in Europe as policymakers around the world consider the consequences of transport and supply disruptions resulting from efforts to contain the disease.\n\nRoberto Gualtieri, Italy's economy minister, said on Sunday the government would introduce tax credits for companies that reported a 25 per cent drop in revenues, as well as tax cuts and extra cash for the health system.\n\nThe package will amount to 0.2 per cent of GDP, he told La Repubblica, and would come in addition to \u20ac900m worth of measures unveiled on Friday for the most severely hit regions.\n\nRome will simultaneously seek authorisation from Brussels to increase the budget deficit for this year, the Treasury said over the weekend.\n\nThe eurozone's third-largest economy, which was on the brink of recession before the disease, needs \"shock therapy\", said Giuseppe Conte, Italy's prime minister, on Sunday in an interview with il Fatto Quotidiano newspaper.\n\nThe move comes as investors and policymakers anticipate more harm to the global economy than previously thought. Global markets shed four-months of gains last week over concerns the response to the spread of the new disease will hit economic activity and companies profit more heavily than initially anticipated.\n\nData released on Saturday showed that China's manufacturing sector suffered the steepest decline in activity on record in February, leading some economists to warn that the country could report an economic contraction in the second quarter.\n\nOfficial figures suggest that the virus, also known as Covid-19, is now spreading faster outside China, where it originated. Beijing reported 573 new confirmed cases and 35 deaths on Sunday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases on the mainland to 79,824.\n\nOn Friday, Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell signalled that the US central bank was considering cutting interest rates in response to the \"evolving risks\" to the US economy posed by the spread of coronavirus.\n\nSouth Korea, which with 3,736 cases has suffered the largest outbreak outside China, has also announced new stimulus measures to help buffer the fallout for Asia's fourth-biggest economy after a series of stoppages at the country's factories prompted concerns over damage to the global technology supply chain.\n\nThe death toll in the country rose to 18 on Sunday and authorities reported that a 45-day-old infant was among the new infections, South Korea's youngest case.\n\nWith more than 1,100 confirmed cases and 29 dead, Italy is home to one of the largest coronavirus outbreak outside Asia. The country has placed 11 towns -- and their 50,000 residents -- under lockdown in the wealthy north until the end of next week, closed schools and universities, and cancelled football matches and fashion shows.\n\nFrance has become the second-hardest hit country in Europe with 100 cases and two deaths recorded. After a cabinet meeting on Saturday, the government banned all indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people and outdoor meetings. The Paris half marathon and the last day of Paris agricultural fair were both halted.\n\nMeanwhile in Berlin, finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Sunday that the German government had the financial firepower to fund an economic stimulus programme should it become necessary. The country confirmed 76 cases in nine different states. Four out of five infections were mild or come even totally without symptoms, the health minister said.\n\nIran which has recorded the highest death toll due to coronavirus, said at the weekend that casualties had risen to 54, from 43 on Friday. This is out of a total of 978 cases officially reported -- a figure that increased from 593.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

holiday island of Bali is severely underprepared to deal with the deadly coronavirus, threatening its 4m inhabitants and a tourist industry worth billions of dollars each year.\n\nInterviews with staff at the three Bali hospitals earmarked to treat victims of a virus that has infected more than 80,000 people around the world point to a lack of equipment, staff and infrastructure required to deal with an outbreak.\n\n\"I'm not convinced,\" Ni Ketut Pande Sri Widnyani, senior doctor at Sanjiwani Gianyar hospital, one of the facilities, said of Bali's ability to handle such a crisis. \"Right now we're not up to the required standard,\" she said of the hospital. \"There's a lack of facilities and\u2009I pray we won't be infected.\"\n\nIndonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, has yet to report a single confirmed case of the coronavirus despite its strong economic ties with the rest of Asia and especially China where the illness originated. Given that the virus has quickly spread to almost 40 countries, international experts question whether this is credible.\n\n\"A country with lots of travel from China would be expected to host infected travellers,\" said Ian Mackay, a Queensland University virologist, noting a Harvard report that identified Bali as a popular destination with visitors from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. \"The absence of [the virus from Bali] is unexpected because that destination list has otherwise been very accurate.\"\n\nBali is considered particularly exposed to a virus outbreak because of its popularity with mainland Chinese who accounted for 1.2m of its more than 6m international visitors last year.\n\nAfter China declared the outbreak in January some of these tourists extended their stay in Bali rather than going home. A large number of Indonesians also work in China, often as domestic helpers.\n\nIndonesia's government has defended itself against accusations of complacency. Yet the country's health minister has also advised Indonesians to use prayer to ward off the virus and criticised a Harvard warning of probable unreported Indonesian cases.\n\nIn Bali, a lush island also popular with western visitors, nine doctors specialising in respiratory diseases are on call and 27 isolation rooms have been set aside in case of an outbreak.\n\nYet when the Financial Times visited last weekend, only five were classed as \"negative pressure rooms\" -- those fitted with airflow systems that prevent pathogens from spreading around the hospital.\n\nPutu Agus Sardana, a surgeon at another of the hospitals, at Sanglah, said they were well-equipped but admitted 100 such rooms would be needed if Bali was hit with an outbreak.\n\nAt Tabanan hospital, the third facility, spokesperson I Made Suarjaya said protective gear was \"urgently\" needed.\n\n\"We requested 1,000 sets of clothing at the start of the outbreak but the order's still being processed,\" he said.\n\nMs Pande said her only defence came from the face mask she wears but which many experts believe is ineffective against coronavirus. \"If there's a coronavirus patient I'll definitely be infected,\" she said.\n\nThe treatment of suspected patients in Bali also suggests a lack of rigour. A Balinese stewardess from Lion Air, who had been to Wuhan, was admitted to hospital last month and diagnosed with a throat inflammation, a possible sign of the virus. Yet she was discharged when her condition improved.\n\nIn another case, an Indonesian woman whose child had visited the Chinese city of Dalian was diagnosed with viral pneumonia, but this did not raise alarm bells at the hospital because she had not been to China and her child was not deemed to be ill. The mother too was discharged.\n\nGede Wahyu Pramana, the nurse who treated the woman, said she \"had no idea\" the patient was a virus suspect but became \"afraid\" when he realised.\n\nSanjiwani Gianyar hospital declined to comment on the case and redirected questions to Bali's health department. Ketut Suarjaya, head of Bali's health agency, declined to comment. Indonesia's health ministry defended the country's approach and said personnel were working within their means.\n\nEven without confirmed cases, the virus outbreak is already taking its toll on Bali, where tourism accounts for about 80 per cent of the economy. On Jimbaran beach, seafood restaurants popular with Chinese tourists were all but empty last weekend. I Made Mahendra, manager of the Aroma eatery, said income had halved this month. \"I feel so worried,\" he said.\n\nDespite this, some Chinese said they preferred to take their chances on Bali than in their home country.\n\nTiger, a holiday-maker from the city of Xi'an, came to the island with his family before all flights home were suspended. Pointing to the fact that Indonesia had no reported cases of the virus, he said: \"We feel safer in Bali than in China.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"},

recession in the first quarter of this year as the rapidly worsening coronavirus outbreak threatens to further damage an economy that was already shrinking.\n\nThe Italian economy contracted 0.3 per cent quarter on quarter in the final three months of 2019, the steepest decline in six years, and the global economic impact of coronavirus could drive a further contraction in the succeeding quarter, said economists. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.\n\n\"The first-quarter hit to China from the coronavirus will probably drive further weakness in Italy's manufacturing-sensitive economy,\" said Nadia Gharbi, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management.\n\nThe majority of cases of the virus that have been diagnosed so far are concentrated in the wealthy regions of Lombardy and Veneto that make up about a third of Italy's output.\n\nThe nation's finance capital, Milan, is at the heart of the outbreak and has shut down schools, offices and tourist attractions as part of its response to the outbreak. Some businesses have asked workers in affected areas to stay at home.\n\nItaly has quarantined at least 10 northern towns and the southern region of Basilicata has imposed a quarantine on people arriving from the northern regions of Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Liguria.\n\nThe combination of travel restrictions and disruption to work, supply chains and tourism all threaten to weigh on the country's struggling economy.\n\n\"There is a clear risk that [the Italian economy] falls back into recession for the fourth time since 2008,\" said Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics.\n\nInvestors reacted on Monday by seeking safety in the financial markets. Italy's FTSE MIB index of leading shares fell 4.6 per cent, leaving it on track for its worst day since June 2016.\n\nThe yield on Italy's benchmark 10-year government bonds, which moves inversely to price, rose 9 basis points from market close on Friday, to 1 per cent.\n\nItaly's tourism industry is particularly vulnerable to the shutdowns resulting from the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe country attracts about 128m arrivals annually, almost equally split between domestic and foreign visitors. Foreign visitors accounted for about \u20ac42bn of spending in the country in 2018, according to calculations by the Bank of Italy.\n\n\"I am dealing with cancellation after cancellation,\" said Guido Carresi, who manages two hotels in central Florence and was looking forward to the beginning of the high season. \"If the fear for the spread of the virus continues for long, it will be really tough for our finances this year.\"\n\nThe economic value-added generated by tourism amounts to nearly 6 per cent of gross domestic product in Italy, according to calculations by the Bank of Italy, a higher contribution to economic growth than in France and Germany.\n\nThe wider economic environment was already looking grim. Mr Allen-Reynolds expects \"domestic demand is likely to have remained very weak\" in the first quarter of 2020, while \"the outlook for investment is particularly poor, with firms reporting that conditions for investment have worsened\".\n\nItaly's exporters and manufacturers were battling an economic drag from the past two years of US-China trade tensions and the slowdown in Germany's car industry, while domestic demand remains below the level it was a decade ago.\n\nNow the shutdowns and supply chain disruptions caused by coronavirus add \"a further headwind to industrial production\", said Mr Allen-Reynolds.\n\nItaly's exporters have been critical in recent years in staving off a deeper slump for the eurozone's third-largest economy by output. Over the past three years, Italy's exports of goods and services grew at more than three times the pace of the overall economy, and expanded at a slightly faster speed than those of France and Germany.\n\nAs a share of GDP, Italy's exports of goods and services rose to 31 per cent in 2018, from 25 per cent in 2010.\n\nItaly's long tradition of high-value exports has been powered by its international reputation for quality in sectors ranging from luxury fashion to food as well as industrial manufacturing.\n\nThis has kept many Italian businesses going as the country's economy has flatlined in the past two years, dragged down by the low productivity of domestically-oriented businesses, adverse demographics and poor job growth.\n\nBut they are particularly exposed to both the domestic and global economic consequences of the disease.\n\n\"Whatever growth [Italy] has experienced in recent years has been closely correlated to how the global economy has fared,\" said Silvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment. \"At the same time domestic demand has been sluggish, implying that Italian growth has been particularly vulnerable to external shocks.\"\n\nThe pain caused by a slowdown for exporters could have particularly notable economic consequences as a result of the sharply higher productivity these companies exhibit compared with domestic-focused businesses.\n\nItaly's exporters are more than twice as productive than non-exporting businesses, according to official data, as well as being bigger in size and offering Italian workers higher wages.\n\nIf these exporting businesses are hurt, the pain is likely to be felt across the domestic economy.\n\nItaly' household domestic consumption has not grown over the past decade, while real average wages are still below pre-crisis levels and job growth is the slowest of any other major eurozone economy over the past two years.\n\nItaly's economy minister Roberto Gualtieri said on Sunday that \"in the baseline scenario, this impact may still be relatively small and temporary\". But, he added, \"there is full awareness of the risks that a wider spread of the epidemic represents for global growth\".\n\nLorenzo Codogno, a former chief economist at the Italian Treasury, said the virus hit Italy as it faced \"an already-fragile economic and public finance situation\".\n\nA quarter-on-quarter contraction of between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent in the first three months of 2020 \"would not be outside of a reasonable range of predictions\" if the outbreak does not worsen further, he said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"},

and supported a proposal that would compel the iPhone maker to uphold freedom of expression globally and be more transparent in how it responds to Beijing's demands to restrict certain apps.\n\nApple faced similar proposals in 2016 and 2018 that drew less than 10 per cent approval. This year's ballot -- which Apple tried to strike from the agenda -- failed again, but with only 59.4 per cent voting against.\n\nThe results send a \"very clear message that Apple's shareholders want it to do better on human rights\", said Sondhya Gupta, campaigns manager at SumOfUs, a consumer advocacy group that submitted the proposal.\n\nConcern over how Apple coordinates with governments came to a head last autumn when Apple removed from the App Store a crowdsourced mapping application used by protesters in Hong Kong, just days after criticism from Chinese state media.\n\nThe proposal received broader support after the two major shareholder advisory groups, ISS and Glass Lewis, came out in favour.\n\nMs Gupta told the Financial Times she hoped Apple would \"feel the pressure\" to act. If it did not offer more disclosure related to how it complies with government requests to ban certain content, it risked being defeated at the next meeting in 2021, she said.\n\nApple has long said that it \"must follow applicable law wherever it does business and believes in engaging with governments even when there may be disagreement.\"\n\nMs Gupta called that reasoning \"a fallacy,\" saying there was no reason to think engaging with authoritarian governments was having a positive influence on them. \"In the decade that Apple's been operating in China the government has become ever more repressive,\" she said.\n\n\"By agreeing to Beijing's demands, Apple is complicit in the repression of Tibetans, Uyghurs and other activists, exposing it to huge reputational and business risks.\"\n\nApple's annual shareholder meeting was otherwise an upbeat affair. It focused on the group's solid 2019 results, with no mention of how the group's coronavirus-related revenue warning last week has wiped about $150bn from the company's market value.\n\nChief executive Tim Cook called the coronavirus \"a challenge\" in prepared remarks, but none of the eight questions he took from shareholders touched on the issue. Instead, taking questions via an iPad, he fielded more benign queries such as why Apple does not buy the sitcom Friends for its TV streaming service.\n\nMr Cook did reveal that Apple would open its first retail store in India in 2021, something he said has been \"years\" in the making. He said the Indian government had wanted Apple to work with a local partner, but Apple had objected.\n\n\"We wouldn't be a very good partner in retail. We like to do things our way,\" he told the 1,000 shareholders gathered at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino.\n\nAs for Friends, Mr Cook called himself a fan of the show but said Apple's streaming service is about innovation rather than rehashing old content. \"It wouldn't feel like Apple,\" he said. \"We are going to focus on original programming.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType":

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH, told the Wall Street Journal that he expects a clinical trial of about 20 to 25 healthy volunteers to start in April, with initial results available in July and August.\n\nModerna uses a molecule called messengerRNA that transfers genetic information into cells, which the company says mimics a natural infection to stimulate a more potent immune response. This vaccine tries to mimic the spike protein found on the novel coronavirus and other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrom and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome.\n\nThe manufacture of the vaccine candidate was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a group of governments and non-profits that launched a $1bn programme to cut vaccine development time in Davos in 2017.\n\nModerna had up to 100 employees working on the effort, including through the weekend. The first batch was finished on February 7 but it had to be tested over two weeks.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended-hours_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extended-hours trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

This is raising fears that the outbreak will spread into neighbouring countries where fragile health systems and weak government control would make fighting the deadly illness even more difficult.\n\nAt least 139 people in Iran have tested positive for coronavirus so far, including the country's deputy health minister who was filmed sweating heavily and repeatedly wiping his face at a coronavirus press conference on Monday. Of those cases, 19 people have died in the past week, according to official figures.\n\nThe first cases were traced to the holy city of Qom, 140km south of Tehran and home to 1.2m people. Qom receives business travellers and Islamic pilgrims from all over the globe and has the highest number of Shia Muslim clerical students in the world. A few hundred of those students are believed to be Chinese nationals. But Iranian authorities are yet to identify the patient that first brought the virus to Iran.\n\nSince the first cases in Qom, coronavirus has now been detected in 19 of Iran's 31 provinces, including those areas where most of the country's 80m population live.\n\nAfter weeks of denying that any Iranian had been diagnosed with coronavirus, health ministry officials confirmed that two people had tested positive for Covid-19 in Qom on Wednesday last week. Later on the same day the officials confirmed their deaths. The short time between the confirmation of the infections and the deaths puzzled many in Iran and fuelled public suspicions that officials had intentionally hid the presence of the virus for some weeks.\n\nThe outbreak has come at a moment when public trust in the Islamic regime is at a record low after Iran's armed forces mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet in January, killing all 176 people on board, including many Iranians, and allegedly tried to cover up the incident.\n\nThe health ministry categorically denies that it has hidden coronavirus cases and insists people's health is its top priority. But a member of parliament from Qom has alleged that at least 50 people have died in the religious city alone, sparking an investigation from Iran's top security body, the Supreme National Security Council.\n\nIran has a well-developed health sector, which normally attracts many people from the region, particularly Iraq, seeking medical treatment. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979, medical services have been extended to even the most remote villages, and the country's highly educated population means Iran has many doctors, pharmacists and nurses.\n\nIran also has recent experience of controlling the outbreak of disease. It eradicated polio in the first decade after the revolution and last year prevented the spread of type-B flu, according to health officials, after it killed more than 100 people.\n\nBut its capacity to contain coronavirus is less certain. Iran is struggling under the economic impact of US sanctions and Iranians are increasingly concerned the restrictions will lead to shortages of vital medical supplies. Iran has granted top priority to its food and medical sectors, while European pharmaceutical companies have waivers from the US to supply Iran with medicine. But since the first deaths were announced, Iranians have started panic buying foodstuffs, face masks and sanitisers, leading to shortages on pharmacy shelves.\n\nAs US sanctions have severed Iran's links with much of the global economy, the republic has been increasingly dependent on trade with Iraq, China, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Russia. Iranian businessmen frequently travel to these countries.\n\nIraq is most at risk. It shares a 1,500km-long frontier with Iran and nine border crossings that see a steady traffic of people and goods every day worth $12bn a year. Alaa al-Qaisi, an Iraqi border official, said the southern crossings had been closed to Iranians since Saturday but already five people have been diagnosed with coronavirus in Iraq -- all of them came from Iran.\n\nAn outbreak in Iraq would be devastating, health officials say, since decades of sanctions, violence and instability have left the country's hospitals under-resourced and short-staffed. \"Frankly we have a problem in the healthcare system in Iraq\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009so we focus on prevention,\" said Dr Saif Badr, spokesperson for the Iraqi health ministry.\n\nAfghanistan has identified seven suspected cases in the province of Herat, which borders Iran, and one confirmed case of an individual who recently returned from Qom. Pakistan has closed its border with Iran but says it has identified no cases so far.\n\nIranian officials have their own concerns about neighbouring states. \"Can you believe Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan have lower casualties than Iran? It is impossible,\" said one official. \"Our neighbours either have business reasons not to disclose their deaths like Turkey and UAE, or do not have the laboratory capability to detect the virus.\"\n\nBahrain has reported seven cases since Monday, all whom had recently returned from Iran via Dubai. It has now barred all flights from Dubai and Sharjah airports in the UAE. Bahrain has no direct flights to Iran but many of its majority Shia Muslim population travel regularly to pilgrimage sites in the Islamic republic via the UAE, where low-cost airlines serve five different Iranian cities.\n\nDubai, the world's busiest airport in terms of international traffic, is a trade and travel hub for China, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. After initially maintaining flights to Iran, the UAE ceased all services to and from the country on Tuesday, raising fears about the impact for the Dubai economy, which has been struggling since oil prices collapsed in 2014. It has reported 13 cases so far, including visitors from Iran and China.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"https://www.ft.com/content/fd8bfd8a-5a25-11ea-abe5-8e03987b7b20", "title": "Coronavirus: how the outbreak is changing global politics", "body": "There is a plaque in the English seaside town of Weymouth which records, matter-of-factly: \"The Black Death entered England in 1348 through this port. It killed 30-50 per cent of the country's total\n\npopulation\".\n\nInternational epidemics are a centuries-old phenomena that have often changed the course of history. The Black Death, which some believe originated in China and others trace to the Crimea, caused devastation across Europe -- bringing social, economic and political turmoil in its wake. Centuries later, it was European explorers who carried new diseases across the Atlantic -- creating epidemics that decimated indigenous populations in the Americas.\n\nSince the coronavirus appears to have a mortality rate of around 2 per cent it will not have the impact of history's worst pandemics. But, for a modern society, the worst-case scenarios are still shocking. This week a leaked British government estimate outlined an extreme case in which 80 per cent of the UK public is infected, leading to 500,000 deaths. Professor Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health has predicted that between 40 and 70 per cent of people worldwide are likely to be infected in the coming year -- although many will have only mild symptoms or none at all.\n\nA public health emergency, combined with a global recession, has the potential to change politics around the world. At this stage, the most obvious risks concern China, the US presidential election, a rise in international tensions, and the threat to the world's poorest countries and to refugees.\n\nDonald Trump, US president, said this week that \"coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\" and suggested that now might be a good time to buy stocks. Mr Trump has always believed a soaring stock market would be a huge asset in his bid for re-election in November. Now he seems anxious that a potential pandemic could upend the election. But if the president's predictions that the epidemic will be contained prove over-optimistic, he may have increased his own political vulnerability.\n\nThe Trump administration's record on preparing for epidemics is also vulnerable to attack. After the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, the Obama administration hosted an international summit to set up global arrangements to deal with future epidemics -- and it created a unit in the National Security Council to focus on the issue. But that unit was disbanded by the Trump administration in 2018 and America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also suffered drastic cuts to its epidemic prevention activities.\n\nA pandemic -- if one is eventually declared -- could increase calls for more government direction of the US health system, which might bolster the arguments made for nationalised healthcare by Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.\n\nGiven the strong libertarian tradition on the American far-right -- and the popularity of conspiracy theories about the federal government's plan to remove the liberties of ordinary Americans -- the US government would struggle to quarantine towns in the manner seen in China and on a smaller scale, in Italy.\n\nAny effort to do so could potentially spark violence between the federal authorities and gun-toting militias.\n\nUnlike Mr Trump, Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, does not have to worry about re-election. Yet, the coronavirus still poses a threat to his popularity and legitimacy -- and even, conceivably, to his leadership.\n\nWith travel outside the country sharply curtailed and major Chinese cities effectively shut down, it is clear that Xi's China is simultaneously facing a health emergency, an economic crisis and international embarrassment.\n\nThe government in Beijing has sought to portray the virus as a natural disaster -- with no fault attached to Mr Xi or his administration. The official line stresses Beijing's ability to take rapid and effective action, and the social solidarity displayed by ordinary Chinese people as they battle to contain the epidemic. With more than half the country of 1.4bn facing some restrictions on their freedom of movement and 150m facing controls on leaving their homes, China has arguably initiated the largest cordon sanitaire in history.\n\nNonetheless, the official story is clearly open to challenge -- as was demonstrated by the outcry sparked by the death of Li Wenliang, a young doctor working in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic. In the early days of the crisis, Li had raised the alarm in an online chat group. This earned him a visit from the police, who forced him to promise to stop spreading rumours and to sign a confession. On his deathbed, Li made a statement that later went viral -- \"I think a healthy society should not only have one kind of voice\". Without mentioning China's president, Li's dying testament was an elegant and poignant condemnation of the style of strongman politics that Mr Xi has pursued.\n\nThe global blame game has already begun to intensify tensions between nations as conspiracy theories proliferate and borders close.\n\nIn internet chat rooms in China, speculation that the virus was manufactured in America to damage China is common. Officials in Beijing have not voiced conspiracy theories of this sort, but some of their counterparts in the US have not been so restrained. Senator Tom Cotton, a hawkish Republican with presidential ambitions, has suggested that the coronavirus was spawned by a bio-weapons programme in a government laboratory in Wuhan. In Iran, where senior members of the government have become infected with the virus, President Hassan Rouhani has called the fears spread by coronavirus \"a conspiracy by the enemies of Iran\".\n\nDirectly blaming other countries for the manufacture or spread of the virus remains comparatively rare. But the adoption of quarantines and travel bans across the world is causing friction between nations.\n\nChinese officials have criticised the Trump administration's decision to deny entry to foreign nationals who had been in China in the previous 14 days -- as well as a travel advisory warning Americans not to visit the country -- saying the measures had \"triggered unnecessary panic\". Meanwhile, Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, has criticised China and Iran for withholding information. Yet Beijing wants praise from the international community for its efforts to contain the virus. Wang Yi, Chinese foreign minister, insisted: \"China is not only protecting its own people but also the rest of the world.\"\n\nBut as the situation rapidly deteriorated in South Korea there was a proliferation of anti-Chinese sentiment, in part directed at Beijing but also at President Moon Jae-in for his government's reluctance to ban Chinese visitors. Despite their difficult relationship, Japan has studiously avoided any criticism of Beijing over the outbreak. But Japan's public reaction has been more hostile, with some restaurants putting up signs refusing Chinese customers.\n\nWith a major outbreak of the virus confirmed in Italy, the EU is now concerned about a threat to the Schengen border-free travel zone, which covers 26 European countries. The continent's refugee crisis has already put Schengen under strain -- with countries such as France and Austria re-establishing border checks. Under EU law, countries are allowed to close their frontiers in the case of a public health emergency. But such actions are meant to follow clear guidelines issued by Brussels. The danger is that, as the political pressure mounts, EU countries may take haphazard and uncoordinated actions.\n\nInternational trade could suffer as much as international travel. Globalisation has not been a fashionable cause for some years -- as protectionists blame trade for job losses, and Green politicians highlight the environmental costs. The epidemic gives the anti-globalisers another argument, allowing them to highlight the dangers of relying on supply chains vulnerable to the kinds of disruption caused by the virus.\n\nUp to now, the biggest confirmed outbreaks of the virus have mostly taken place in rich or middle-income countries with strong central governments -- such as China, Japan, Italy and South Korea. But the virus will be much harder to contain, if and when it spreads to poorer nations, with less-developed health systems. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, has reported its first case. And there are fears that there may already be significant numbers of cases in nations such as Indonesia and India -- which have not yet been reported. Indonesia, with a population of 270m and close economic and transport ties to China, is a particular concern.\n\nIn Europe and the Middle East, refugees are often living in crowded camps in unhealthy conditions, with 12m scattered across Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey and Syria -- and a further 1m (mainly Afghans) in Iran. The situation of the Syrians fleeing the current military assault on Idlib -- many of whom are living in tents along the Turkish border -- is already desperate, and looks vulnerable to the spread of contagion. In that context, the Turkish government's announcement this week that it will no longer restrict the flow of refugees to Europe will alarm the EU.\n\nThe past week has seen the coronavirus mutate into a truly global crisis. The worst-case health scenarios will probably be avoided. But the political effects of the outbreak are only just beginning.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

markets, the euro has behaved oddly: it has climbed.\n\nTypically, bouts of nerves have a predictable impact on major currencies. When the going gets tough, because of economic or geopolitical shocks, traders head for the US dollar, lured by its traditional role as a super-liquid haven and by its tendency to rally when investors close out bets that had been funded with the currency. Even when shocks are US-focused, such as during the failure of Lehman Brothers, the dollar shoots higher, crushing other currencies such as the euro.\n\nBut when Covid-19 really started shaking up stock markets this week, the euro rallied. Even while European shares have suffered their most bruising few days since the eurozone debt crisis in 2011, the euro has gained 1.5 per cent against the dollar. It also had its best week since August 2018 against a trade-weighted basket of other currencies, climbing 1.2 per cent.\n\n\"I think we are seeing a trend change in the euro against the dollar,\" said Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco. \"The mystery is not why the euro is going up now -- it's why it hasn't been going up before.\"\n\nAnalysts and investors have pointed to the prospect of a new framework for the single currency for some time. In December, Deutsche Bank said the euro was experiencing \"an important regime break\", with the currency zone becoming a net supplier, not recipient, of global investment flows.\n\nNegative deposit rates in the euro area, which have languished below zero since June 2014, mean that investors are encouraged to borrow in the currency and put the money to work elsewhere. Loans by eurozone banks to non-residents had risen to the highest levels since 2008, Deutsche noted, adding that any shot of nerves would be likely to push the currency higher, as people closed out euro-funded bets.\n\n\"The euro is likely to exhibit increasing 'carry trade' behaviour where depreciation is gradual but appreciation pressures are sharp as positions are unwound,\" wrote analyst George Saravelos in December.\n\nThat has proven prescient. One hedge fund manager said that when the market mood was more upbeat at the start of this year, selling the euro to buy the Mexican peso, Indian rupee, Norwegian krone and other currencies was a popular strategy. Now that the virus has spread, spilling outside of China's borders, those bets are being unwound, giving the euro a boost in the process.\n\nExpectations that the US central bank may respond to market ructions with a cut to its key interest rate have also dented the dollar's recent strength. Yields on US government bonds have fallen particularly sharply since fears over the spread of the virus increased, diminishing the appeal of the US bond market over that of the eurozone. That is another factor that tilts the scales further in favour of the euro, said Invesco's Mr Jackson.\n\nStandard Chartered strategists said on Thursday that they now expect two rate cuts in the US this year to alleviate the effects of the outbreak. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is thought to have less space to cut its own rates from already rock-bottom levels.\n\n\"The market is pricing much larger rate cuts from the Fed than the ECB leading to a very large contraction in the interest rate differential [between the two regions],\" said Deutsche's Mr Saravelos this week.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that this week's moves are more than just a blip. \"I'm struggling to see the move higher in the euro as a meaningful regime change,\" said Dominic Bunning, a currencies analyst at HSBC.\n\nInstead, he attributed some of the recent moves higher in the euro to an unwinding of recent bets that the euro would fall against the dollar. \"I think this is much more about a short-term adjustment in positions, with a lot of people rushing to close out positions due to the increasing uncertainty,\" Mr Bunning said. \"Closing trades is not even necessarily a rational, economically sound decision in terms of what investors want to own; it's more about not wanting to have any open positions.\"\n\nJordan Rochester, an analyst at Nomura, echoed that, saying Thursday had become \"a whatever position you have, get out\" sort of day.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

the National Security Council treating 15 coronavirus patients in Nebraska, have called the outbreak a \"pandemic\" -- suggesting hospitals across the US must prepare for a surge of patients.\n\nA pandemic is defined as the worldwide spread of a disease. The warning came as the US reported its first death from the virus.\n\n\"We are clearly in a pandemic. The only reason we're not saying it is because of politics,\" said James Lawler, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. \"It's about time somebody said it.\"\n\nA federal government public health official who was not authorised to speak on the record said: \"It's a pandemic if you can no longer keep it to a specific geographic area.\"\n\n\"Now we have multiple cases of person to person transmission in the US. It's no longer just people flying in with the illness, it's just transmitted within the country. As we've seen in other developed nations with advanced biocontainment systems, efforts to contain the virus were marginally successful.\"\n\nMr Lawler was a member of the Homeland Security Council under president Bush and the National Security Council under president Obama, and part of the group that carried out the NSC's 2005 National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza. He is treating patients infected with the coronavirus who have been evacuated from China and the Diamond Princess cruise liner. Mr Lawler serves as a medical director for the \"biocontainment unit\" at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, a facility for quarantining and treating patients of highly infectious diseases.\n\nOn Friday, an 18-year-old in Snohomish County, Washington, with no history of international travel was diagnosed with Covid-19, pending confirmation by the CDC. \"We don't know how or where the new Snohomish County case was infected,\" said the Washington State Department of Health in an announcement. This is an example of what public health experts call \"community spread\" -- infection from within the same community.\n\nOn Saturday, health officials confirmed that a patient had died in Washington State, the first fatality from the virus in the US.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control in the US and the World Health Organization have not used the word \"pandemic\" to describe the spread of coronavirus. \"Using the word pandemic carelessly has no tangible benefit,\" said the director-general of the World Health Organization on Wednesday. \"It may also signal that we can no longer contain the virus, which is not true\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009of course, we will not hesitate to use the word pandemic if it is an accurate description of the situation.\"\n\n\"I think calling it a pandemic is reasonable,\" said Neil Ferguson, a professor on the Faculty of Medicine in the School of Public Health of Imperial College London. Mr Ferguson is an author of a study on the severity of the coronavirus by the WHO's Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling.\n\nThe distinction between \"outbreak\" and \"pandemic\" determines the response. According to the NSC's 2005 strategy for pandemics, the first response to an outbreak is to contain it locally. If it cannot be contained, then the public health response shifts to \"mitigation\" -- a national mobilisation to protect hospitals and critical infrastructure.\n\nAccording to the strategy, \"Rather than generating a focal point of casualties, the medical burden of a pandemic is likely to be distributed in communities across the nation for an extended period of time.\"\n\nMr Lawler and the public health official both believe that, while the federal government has taken steps in the past several days to increase commercial production of testing kits, it has been reluctant to commit to the national operational consequences of a pandemic -- informing and equipping local governments, hospitals and populations for rolling outbreaks.\n\n\"We need a mobilisation,\" the official said. \"We aren't seeing it.\"\n\nOn Saturday, public health officials held a press conference with President Donald Trump at the White House to announce international travel bans and efforts to develop vaccines and produce protective gear, such as masks. Both Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that they expected to see more cases in the US.\n\nMr Fauci also noted cases of community spread, and said that local health authorities would need to \"identify, isolate and contact trace\" after discovering new cases. \"From within, we will very aggressively do the kind of public health measures that will hopefully contain this,\" he said.\n\nMr Lawler said: \"It seems like they're still thinking in terms of containment. Containment is pointless now.\"\n\nBased on his belief that the outbreak was a pandemic, Mr Lawler expected that 30 to 40 per cent of the US population would be infected.\n\nPublic health officials have few precedents for a pandemic in the US. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, a mild flu epidemic like the one in 1957 could infect 75 million people and cause 100,000 deaths today, with a fatality rate of .1 per cent. A severe one, such as the Spanish Flu of 1918, could infect 90m people, and with a fatality rate of 2.5 per cent, could cause 2m deaths.\n\nMr Lawler estimates that the US will see an outbreak somewhere between the one in 1957 and the one in 1918. \"We're at moderate to severe level if I had to predict where we're going to end up,\" he said. On February 18, the Institute for Disease Modeling wrote that the virus has the potential to be \"comparable to the most severe respiratory pandemic in the last century in the absence of effective control measures.\"\n\n\"We need to invest in vaccines and therapeutics,\" said Mr Lawler, \"but we have to understand that we're not going to have them for this first major wave.\" Most immediately, he said, the US needed to improve hospital surge capacity, and to protect and train healthcare workers and those who run critical infrastructure, as called for in the 2005 NSC strategy.\n\nHe also says local communities need to prepare for \"non-pharmaceutical interventions\" -- closing schools, cancelling public events, encouraging telework, and specific protections for the most vulnerable populations, such as the elderly.\n\n\"We need to harden infrastructure,\" said the federal public health official. \"We need to be providing the equipment to enable local hospitals to contain patients who are infected.\" As part of the National Ebola Training and Education Center, an initiative developed after the Ebola outbreak of 2014, major metropolitan hospitals in the US have been trained to isolate patients, but need the equipment to do so.\n\n\"We're not ramping up the deployment of protective equipment and patient isolation systems,\" said the official. \"As patient numbers rise, they need diagnostic capacity. We're not increasing it.\"\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nebraska_Medical_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Nebraska Medical Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocontainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biocontainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snohomish_County,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Snohomish County, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Snohomish County, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Homeland_Security_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Homeland Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Department_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington State Department of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imperial College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advice and consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

For all the billions that Apple, Google, Facebook and their start-up imitators have spent on elaborate headquarters, many software engineers would be happy to swap their starchitect-designed offices for a decent pair of noise-cancelling headphones and work from anywhere.\n\nSo while few would be quite so crass as to admit it, China's coronavirus-enforced lockdowns make for a fascinating case study of remote working on a massive scale. Millions have had to work from home for weeks, prompting a spike in second-hand laptop and tablet sales in China and driving Alibaba's collaboration app DingTalk to the top of the Chinese App Store charts.\n\nThe good news: much of the tech that underpins remote working, such as the video-conferencing service Zoom and the chat app Slack, is finally mature and reliable. The bad news: not much of it comes with a proper user's manual.\n\nThat has left millions to figure out for themselves how to make sure their Slack joke isn't taken seriously (emoji are your friend) or whether it is acceptable to have laundry visible in the background of a video call with colleagues (it's not).\n\nSpeaking to seasoned remote workers in both big companies and start-ups, working successfully in a \"distributed team\" seems to come down as much to etiquette as tech.\n\nStep one is to remember where people are. Patrick McKenzie, a Tokyo-based software developer and marketer, has worked for San Francisco-based Stripe for more than three years.\n\nYet some colleagues back at the payment company's headquarters still invite him to meetings at 4am in Tokyo. \"One of the most important things about making remote work well is establishing communication norms for it,\" says McKenzie.\n\nMaintaining motivation is another quandary for managers of remote teams. Ryan Hoover, founder of Product Hunt, a fully remote company of 20 employees around the world, gets everyone together for a Monday \"all hands\" Zoom video call.\n\n\"Probably the biggest benefit is seeing each other's faces,\" he says. \"Even though it's only for half an hour or so, it makes people realise they are working with a team and adds some personality to everyone. Every now and then I'll see someone's cat walk past the screen.\"\n\nExpressing that personality only works if your colleagues can see you. Long-time remote workers insist that everyone in a virtual meeting turns on their camera.\n\nAt Stripe, many have invested in desktop lighting rigs. \"Your level of happiness on a video chat is quite sensitive to how your co-workers perceive you,\" says McKenzie. \"Lighting matters a lot.\"\n\nVideo dial-ins to a physical meeting can be a minefield. Delays on the line are one thing; getting people in the room to remember that there is someone on the other end of the camera is another.\n\nIssues like this make some practitioners believe that remote working is an \"all or nothing\" endeavour -- not just when it comes to meetings. If a company has some employees in a central office but others scattered around the world, the remote workers miss out on water-cooler chat and desk-side decision-making -- or at least worry that they might.\n\nTo address this, some start-ups are forcing all their employees to communicate important messages online, via Slack or shared documents, even if they work in the same physical office.\n\nFor Chris Herd, founder of FirstbaseHQ, a start-up that supplies equipment for remote workers, this \"asynchronous\" working style is more relevant than questions of \"office first\" or \"remote first\".\n\nHerd ardently believes asynchronous workplaces -- where employees rarely get together but make decisions via centralised communications systems -- are more productive, allowing for deep, uninterrupted focus: \"Working in the office can mostly be about that instantaneous gratification of availability. It's just disruption.\"\n\nA lot of managers in China will be worrying about whether productivity takes a hit while their staff stay at home. But for Silicon Valley's evangelists, remote working is more than just a stopgap in a crisis -- it is an improvement on office life.\n\nIf the coronavirus continues to spread, many more of us may have the chance to find out for ourselves which it really is.\n\nTim Bradshaw is the FT's global technology correspondent", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"},

coronavirus in sub-Saharan Africa, raising concerns about the spread of the virus on a continent that health experts say is poorly equipped to deal with a potential pandemic.\n\nOfficials said the infected person was an Italian businessman who had returned from Milan to Lagos, Nigeria's commercial centre, where he lives and works. He was clinically stable, with no serious symptoms, the health minister said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe case marks the first recorded spread of the virus to a part of the world with deep economic ties to China -- where the coronavirus started -- and experts believe the continent is the least prepared to diagnose new cases and to contain any rapid spread.\n\n\"There might be cases we have not seen because our surveillance systems are so weak,\" said John Nkengasong, head of the three-year-old African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based in Addis Ababa. But \"the alert system is so high that anyone with symptoms of flu will be tested\", he added, saying that screening at airports had been greatly stepped up.\n\nMr Nkengasong was heading a continent-wide task force working on the principle of \"rapid detection, rapid containment\", he said.\n\n\"We need to pick this up quickly and squash it,\" he said. \"We can't put in place drastic measures like China.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified 13 countries where it will prioritise response because of their direct links to, or high travel volume with, China.\n\nThe concern is that, if the virus starts spreading quickly, fragile health systems would quickly be overwhelmed and hospitals become incubators for the virus rather than a means of controlling it. Few facilities outside big cities such as Abidjan, Nairobi, Lagos or Kinshasa have sufficient respiratory equipment, while some lack basic medicines or even regular electricity supplies.\n\nMr Nkengasong said the main concern was not the fatality rate of coronavirus, but the large numbers who might contract it. \"The case fatality rate of the Spanish flu was not high,\" he said, referring to the roughly 2.5 per cent of patients who died from the 1917-18 epidemic. \"And yet, within two years, at least 50m people were dead.\"\n\nThere have been two other cases in Africa, in more developed Egypt and Algeria. After Algeria declared its first case on Tuesday, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa, warned that the \"window of opportunity the continent has had to prepare for coronavirus disease is closing\".\n\nExperts have been puzzled by a dearth of cases in a continent with close economic ties to China. A recent Lancet study found that Egypt, Algeria, South Africa, Nigeria and Ethiopia have the highest risk of importing the virus, based on air travel patterns from China.\n\nAccording to the WHO, just eight of the 47 countries in its Africa region are adequately prepared to treat the disease.\n\nBut Dr Rosanna Peeling, chair of diagnostic research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the continent was actually better prepared than ever before, in part thanks to a series of recent training courses Africa CDC, WHO and one of the world's leading virologists -- Dr Amadou Sall of Senegal's Institut Pasteur de Dakar -- have held in recent weeks.\n\n\"In terms of preparedness, I think Africa CDC together with WHO Afro has done a huge amount of work getting the continent prepared and these will be templates for future outbreaks that may happen,\" said Dr Peeling, former head of diagnostic research at WHO, who helped conduct the training.\n\nThey have trained experts from 46 of 55 countries in how to screen patients and detect the virus -- key steps to containing any potential outbreak. She said that the Institut Pasteur's online platform -- where scientists can share results from across the continent in real time -- would also help.\n\nThe WHO noted in a statement on Thursday that the region's experience in quashing the 2014 west African Ebola epidemic, in which 11,325 people died, would be instructive, while infrastructure including treatment facilities would be useful. Nigeria was among the most successful countries in the region at containing Ebola [the disease].\n\nOn Friday the shelves of grocery stores in Lagos's well-heeled Ikoyi neighbourhood were cleared of hand sanitiser and running low on disinfecting wipes and hand soap.\n\nAuthorities said the Italian patient was being treated at the Infectious Disease Hospital in Lagos, and that they were working to identify the man's contacts since entering Nigeria.\n\nWhile there have been questions within Nigeria about its ability to handle an outbreak given its shoddy healthcare system, health minister Dr E Osagie Ehanire urged Nigerians not to sow alarm.\n\n\"Citizens must not abuse social media and indulge in spreading misinformation that causes fear and panic,\" he said in the statement.", "source":

religious sect at heart of outbreak\n\nBy Edward White and Kang Buseong in Seoul and Kana Inagaki in Tokyo\n\nSouth Korea reported 256 new cases of coronavirus on Friday morning as officials struggle to locate members of pseudo-Christian sect at the heart of the country's outbreak.\n\nSouth Korea, which is the worst country affected outside China, has now recorded 13 deaths and 2,022 confirmed cases, according to the latest data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control.\n\nThe South Korean outbreak has centred on Daegu, the country's fourth-biggest city, where most cases have been linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.\n\nThe South Korean government has pledged to test the sect's 215,000 South Korean members and has received a list of their names in recent days.\n\nHowever, Park Won-soon, the Seoul mayor, has said that around 1,500 of the group's members in Seoul have so far not responded to phone calls.\n\n\"Shincheonji, with its secretive nature, does not reveal where it is and what it does. This is not different from manslaughter by negligence as transparency is most important in prevention measures,\" he said.\n\nThe increase in South Korea Friday followed a jump of more than 500 confirmed cases on Thursday, as the country's rate of confirmed infections appeared to outpace that of China.\n\nThe South Korean infection rate comes on the back of a sharp increase in testing. Tests have been carried out on nearly 45,000 people and more than 24,000 are currently being tested.\n\nThat compares to neighbouring Japan where there have been 186 confirmed cases and 2,058 tests carried out, according to the Japanese health ministry.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_South_Korea", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of South Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daegu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daegu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Daegu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Won-soon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Park Won-soon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Test_Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Test Facilities", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Testing_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Testing and Tools", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Test_and_Measurement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Test and Measurement", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.ft.com%2Fthe-world%2Ffiles%2F2020%2F02%2Fshutterstock_editorial_South_Korea_Stock_Market_plummet_10565427A.jpeg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "eventUri": "eng-5546252", "location": null, "shares": {"facebook": 136}, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 52}, {"uri": "1458597889", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2020-02-24", "time": "01:47:00", "dateTime": "2020-02-24T01:47:00Z", "dateTimePub": "2020-02-24T01:46:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/a2cffe29-a3f4-35bf-9424-6dee1883d79d", "title": "Coronavirus latest: Rise in cases outside China rattles markets", "body": "Coronavirus cases outside China rattle markets\n\nOil prices slumped, equity markets in Asia-Pacific retreated and US stock futures fell sharply following a jump in new coronavirus cases in Italy and South Korea over the weekend.\n\nSouth Korea raised its alert level to red after the number of confirmed cases in the country surged to more than 600 in a matter of days.

issued by the World Bank will pay out relief funds to countries affected by the coronavirus, as the death toll from the outbreak continues to mount.\n\nIn 2017 the Washington, DC-based institution issued two classes of pandemic bond worth a total of $320m, in a deal designed to help developing nations facing a serious outbreak of infectious disease. The bonds deliver interest payments to investors, funded by donor nations Japan and Germany, until certain trigger conditions are reached. At that point the bonds are not repaid in full and the money is used instead to help tackle the crisis.\n\nFor the riskier of the two bonds to pay out (\"Tranche B\"), the disease must cross an international border and there must be at least 20 fatalities in the second country. Those bonds are trading an average of 57 cents on the dollar, according to an aggregate of four dealers, suggesting that a payout is likely. So far, there have been 34 deaths outside mainland China, 12 of which were in Iran, eight in South Korea, five in Italy and four in Japan.\n\nThe other tranche, which requires there to be 2,500 deaths in developing countries to trigger a payout, is still trading close to par.\n\n\"The market believes there is a significant chance the bond will lose a portion of its nominal [value],\" said David Strasser, senior portfolio manager at Zurich-based Plenum Investments, which has invested in Tranche A.\n\nThe bonds represented an attempt by the World Bank to use global capital markets to change the face of aid and development, but have come under scrutiny for allowing investors to enjoy high double-digit coupons while outbreaks afflict the developing world.\n\nThe bonds have not been triggered to date, despite serious bouts of Ebola and other diseases. Now, as the coronavirus outbreak spreads, critics say that any payments to areas affected would be too little, too late. The riskier of the two bonds requires 12 weeks to have passed since the initial outbreak -- a milestone reached on February 2 because of the way the World Bank calculates the weeks -- and for 250 deaths to have taken place in the country of origin. Almost 2,600 deaths have so far been recorded in China.\n\n\"The terms are too stringent; it shows how useless this instrument is,\" said Bodo Ellmers, director of Global Policy Forum's sustainable development finance programme. \"You obviously want to prevent a pandemic but it only pays out when it becomes a pandemic, that's the fundamental flaw,\" he said.\n\nPandemic bonds are closely held and largely illiquid. Filings collated by Bloomberg show that Tranche B, which matures on June 15, is held by asset managers including Baillie Gifford, Amundi and Stone Ridge Asset Management.\n\nThe biggest cluster of the virus outside of China is on a cruise ship docked in the Japanese port of Yokohama, where there are more than 600 confirmed cases among almost 4,000 passengers. Three people on the ship are reported to have died.\n\nFatalities in any country count towards the trigger conditions but one of the countries affected must be a low-income country, which China is, according to the World Bank.\n\n\"A payout is much more likely than it has been at any point previously,\" said one investor in the Tranche B bond, which pays a coupon of 11.1 per cent over Libor. \"If it's going to happen, the sooner the better,\" the investor added, noting that \"it's important not to lose sight of the human cost\".", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

That was after the September 11 attacks. Donald Trump wants Americans to buy stocks on the bet that something bad will not happen: the spread of the coronavirus infections at home. His gamble could pay off.\n\nBut the US president is staking his credibility on something that is mostly beyond his control. Short of severing all links to the world, which would trigger a recession, the virus will almost certainly spread in the US, say the experts, including those who work for Mr Trump. At which point, who will he blame?\n\nSo far Mr Trump has avoided blaming anyone, including China. His priority is to keep the economy growing in the build-up to the November presidential election. Officials have been told to talk down the threat of the coronavirus.\n\nIf the virus nevertheless emerges, Mr Trump will lose twice over: first, it will damage US growth, and, second, because he will have forfeited trust in what he says about the disease. That sentiment could spread to those voters who usually give Mr Trump a pass. Building trust is a vital element of managing epidemics.\n\nThe virus's political impact could be radically disruptive. Three effects are visible. The first is to remind voters that competence matters. Even hardcore libertarians accept that the state is critical in some areas -- among them security and public health. It is unfortunate that the threat of the coronavirus has coincided with a loyalty drive across the US administration.\n\nMr Trump has entrusted John McEntee, a 29-year-old devotee, with the job of removing officials who have shown any sign of disloyalty. This includes the unelected bureaucrats who do things such as handle threats to public health.\n\nCompetence means following the science. Mr Trump has given the role of coronavirus tsar to Mike Pence, the US vice-president. Mr Pence has wrestled with scientific doubts all his life. Among the highlights are denying that smoking tobacco kills, declaring global warming a myth and presiding over an outbreak of HIV as Indiana's governor by withholding free syringes.\n\nLast year Mr Trump fired his homeland security co-ordinator and abolished the job for global health security. He has also proposed sharp cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization. The upside to Mr Pence's appointment is that Mr Trump could have chosen one of his offspring instead. The US president has spent years denigrating experts. Now that he needs them, we may be about to find out whether he meant it.\n\nThe second blow is to America's openness. Mr Trump has long railed against globalism. That is increasingly echoed by many of his Democratic opponents. This week presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren said the coronavirus exposed America's vulnerability to global supply chains, particularly in China.\n\nRising suspicion about an interconnected world is also likely to benefit Bernie Sanders, the Democratic frontrunner. Joe Biden and Michael Bloomberg have stuck to a more conventional script. But the spirit of the times is running against them. A global pandemic could sharply tilt US politics against globalisation.\n\nShould the virus hit the US hard, the fear will probably stoke an existing American contagion -- the infodemic. So far, Mr Trump has quarantined his comments about the coronavirus from his general tendency to make stuff up. There is a thin line between complacency and panic. Mr Trump is close to the former. That would change if the coronavirus threatened his re-election. The outlines of how he might respond are already there.\n\nOn Wednesday Rush Limbaugh, the radio host to whom Mr Trump awarded the Medal of Freedom earlier this month, said the deep state was using the virus to undermine Mr Trump. He implied that Nancy Messonnier -- the CDC's leading epidemiologist and sister of former deputy attorney-general Rod Rosenstein -- was part of a deep state plot to defeat Mr Trump.\n\nMs Messonnier said it was \"not a question of if, but when\" the virus would spread in America. Another scapegoat has been planted by Tom Cotton, the senator from Arkansas.

outside China in recent days, attention has turned to the likely damage to global output and to the possible reaction of macroeconomic policymakers. This has become urgent with the catastrophic decline in China's PMI business surveys yesterday. The question now is whether a global recession can be avoided.\n\nWhile the health risks from the virus seem lower than seasonal influenza, the response of the public health authorities has been fairly draconian in many affected regions, causing large drops in industrial and consumer activity.\n\nUntil Friday, the official response of macro policymakers in the advanced economies (AEs) to these events had been rather complacent. Leading Federal Reserve officials had said that they were monitoring the extent of the global economic shock and that they had scope to act, but they saw no urgency to cut interest rates. The European Central Bank and Bank of England have reacted similarly.\n\nFortunately, this language suddenly changed with Fed chairman Jay Powell's brief but pointed statement late last week, effectively paving the way for an early reduction in US policy rates. The forward markets, which have reacted more quickly than the Fed on this occasion, are now expecting policy rates to decline by almost 1 percentage point in the next 12 months.\n\nThe likely path for rates now seems fully priced in, on central assumptions about the extent of the output damage, and the type of economic shock that develops.\n\nBefore last week, consensus forecasts showed that activity in the advanced economies would be affected meaningfully in the first half of 2020, but that most of the lost output would be regained in a V-shaped recovery in the rest of the year. Global gross domestic product forecasts for the 2020 calendar year had dropped by only 0.2 per cent.\n\nHowever, there has been a significant darkening in opinion in the last few days. Many forecasters are now talking about a more dire scenario, involving nothing better than a U-shaped cyclical pattern. Further downward revisions to consensus GDP projections for the 2020 calendar year of at least half a percentage point seem highly likely.\n\nThere has been some debate about whether the coronavirus shock should be classified as a demand shock, a supply shock or a financial shock. It seems to have some features of all of these, though confidence effects and tightening financial conditions imply that demand effects are now becoming dominant.\n\nEconomists like Olivier Blanchard, who emphasise the supply side effects from a falling labour force and disrupted supply chains for goods are right in principle, but that will not stop the Fed from easing. There is no danger of supply-induced inflation in present circumstances.\n\nIn China, the initial effects of enforced industrial shutdowns that have affected global value chains may soon ease.\n\nThe politburo decided recently to permit the reopening of some industrial plants. While President Xi Jinping's attitude still seems very confusing, there is early evidence from JPMorgan's daily tracking data that the flow of international trade through the nation's ports and airports has rebounded towards more normal levels. March could be a difficult month for global manufacturing output in many economies, but supply chains may improve in the spring.\n\nThe problem is that mitigation measures designed to slow the spread of the virus are likely to lead to severe declines in consumer confidence and lower levels of expenditure on services such as travel, restaurants and hotels in population centres.\n\nSmall companies in consumer service sectors, without easy access to bank finance, have rapidly faced liquidity problems which are threatening to cause a credit crunch in China.\n\nInterest rates have been reduced throughout Asia and, more importantly, central banks have provided extraordinary credit facilities to encourage commercial banks to maintain funding to stressed companies. More of these emergency policy interventions may be needed in the major economies very soon.\n\nIn summary, the lesson from the virus-hit economies is that a large demand shock will probably develop in the advanced economies, affecting consumer spending, with a financial squeeze threatening SMEs. This is likely to lead to a weakening labour market and lower inflation. There has also been a supply chain shock, but this may soon start to abate.\n\nShould markets be worried that policymakers cannot now prevent a global recession?\n\nIn a plausible downside scenario, Fed Board member Lael Brainard's recent speech on monetary policy in a collapsing US economy would become highly relevant. She recommended that US policy rates should be reduced to zero, with forward guidance promising to hold rates at zero until inflation had returned to the 2 per cent target.\n\nThis would be backed by Japanese-style yield curve control. Yields on medium dated government debt would be capped, and the central bank would buy 10-year debt outright. This should be supported by a fiscal easing, while bond yields are held close to zero.\n\nMs Brainard is a dove, but her speech might become the Fed's road map for the downside case, in which a Covid-19 global recession is threatened.\n\nThe news about economic activity in the advanced economies will certainly get worse before it gets better but there is still time for determined policy action to avert a recession.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type":
