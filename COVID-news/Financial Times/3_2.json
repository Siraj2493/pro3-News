As the number of patients requiring intensive care balloons and hospitals run out of intensive care beds, doctors were instructed to \"aim to guarantee intensive treatment to patients with the greatest chance of therapeutic success\".\n\nWith the grim task of selecting patients unlikely to survive, Italy's health authorities have pleaded with the countries' friends and allies for emergency supplies. On Thursday, they finally arrived -- from Shanghai. The China Eastern flight brought a medical team and 31 tonnes of supplies including ventilators.\n\nBeijing's gesture has reinforced a perceived lack of support from Europe, compounded by a communications blunder by the European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde, who implied on Thursday it was no longer her job to keep Italy in the euro.\n\nWhen Italy asked for urgent medical supplies under a special European crisis mechanism no EU country responded. Fearful of its own shortages, Germany banned the export of medical masks and other protective gear. 3M, a producer, said the German restrictions made it impossible to supply the Italian market. Then Austria unilaterally closed its borders to people arriving from Italy unless they could prove they were virus-free.\n\nThe rebuffs are nourishing resentment that Italy has been abandoned by its European friends. It is a perception that has taken root over a decade, of a currency union that lacks collective solidarity and stifles growth as Italy confronted migrant flows from Africa and the Middle East. This, in turn, has fuelled the rise of Eurosceptic nationalists such as far-right firebrand Matteo Salvini.\n\n\"It is back to the future, where Italy is left on its own,\" said Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute for International Affairs in Rome. \"It was the case with the eurozone crisis, then the migrant crisis of 2015-16 and now the coronavirus crisis. It is the same old story and the political implications could be massive.\"\n\nAs Rome's anger mounted this week, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, tried to reassure Italians the EU was on their side, promising flexibility over EU deficit rules and a \u20ac25bn investment fund for fighting the crisis across the bloc. But the warm words from Brussels were soon drowned out by a message from Frankfurt.\n\nChristine Lagarde's comment that it was not the ECB's job to \"close the spreads\" between 10-year Italian treasuries and German Bunds -- a measure of the risk differential between the two sovereign debts -- caused it to spike by 60 basis points, the biggest daily increase on record. The FTSE MIB, Milan's blue-chip stock index, plummeted 17 per cent, its biggest daily drop, out-slumping other equity markets on a terrible day for investors around the world.\n\n\"Italy needed help and it has been given a slap in the face,\" said Matteo Salvini, leader of the nationalist League party who said he would look into seeking compensation from the central bank.\n\nHe added: \"The only help that has come from Europe has been to cause the collapse of the stock market and to make the spread go crazy. Yesterday Italy lost \u20ac68bn of savings.\"\n\nGiorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, attacked Ms Lagarde as an \"evidently inadequate\" ECB president.\n\n\"In 2012 faced with an economic crisis the Italian Mario Draghi used a bazooka to calm it,\" she said. \"Today his French successor Christine Lagarde decided to use a boomerang, with a surreal statement that caused the collapse of the stock market.\"\n\nHours after Ms Lagarde spoke -- the ECB a day later insisted it \"stood ready to do more\" -- Sergio Mattarella, Italy's president, unusually spoke out to say that a country in crisis expected \"initiatives of solidarity and not obstacles to action\".\n\n\"The job of the central bank should not be to hinder but to help such measures by creating favourable financial conditions for them,\" said prime minister Giuseppe Conte.\n\nThe spike in the spread -- a popular metric in Italy since the eurozone debt crisis -- reinforced a narrative that when a crisis hits, the country is on its own.\n\nMs Lagarde's comments appeared to undo the work of her Italian predecessor, Mario Draghi, who was instrumental in restoring confidence that Italy could remain in the eurozone, while echoing the sentiments of hawkish German policymakers, said Ms Tocci.\n\nIt did not help that Ms Lagarde's explosive remarks about \"lo spread\" -- as the Italians call it -- won approval from Jens Weidmann, president of Germany's Bundesbank.\n\nThe EU could yet put in place a co-ordinated rescue package for Italy, including Italian bond-buying by the ECB.\n\nBut Ms Lagarde's comments had exposed \"an underlying vulnerability in the eurozone centred on Italy's precarious economic position\", said Kenneth Wattret, chief European economist at IHS Markit. To fix the economic damage of the severe travel disruptions and quarantine restrictions would require the ECB to monetise Italy's debt or a bailout, he said.\n\n\"It is the elephant in the room and this crisis is bringing it home because Italy is now at the heart of the crisis in Europe,\" Mr Wattret added.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors":

north-east of Milan, Dr Daniele Macchini used a short break in the fight he and his colleagues are waging against the novel coronavirus to issue a warning to the world.\n\n\"The war has exploded and the battles are uninterrupted day and night. The cases are multiplying, we have a rate of 15-20 admissions per day all for the same reason,\" he wrote on Facebook last week. \"There are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopaedists -- we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us.\"\n\nThe widely shared cry for help echoes warnings issued by medical staff on the frontline of the epidemic 8,000km away in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged -- including that of Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist who became a hero in China for raising the alarm, before succumbing to the disease.\n\nThe largest outside of China, the outbreak of coronavirus across northern Italy has pushed the country's national health service to breaking point, underlining the challenge that other European countries could soon face should their strategy of containing the disease fail.\n\nBy Tuesday, the first day of a nationwide clampdown on travel and social contact, the total number of infections across Italy had increased to 10,149 from 4,636 on Friday. While about one in 10 have since recovered -- and at least 631 people have died -- 877 patients are currently in intensive care.\n\nLombardy, which has one of the best-resourced regional health systems in Italy, has been facing a surge in acute cases. As of Tuesday the number of people infected in Italy's industrial heart had risen to 5,791, including 446 in intensive care.\n\n\"Franky, I don't know for how long the health system can cope, I don't even want to think about how it could end,\" Massimo Galli, head of the department for infectious diseases at the Sacco Hospital in Milan, told the Financial Times. \"We are holding up, but other hospitals are much worse off than us and it is a fact that we will come increasingly under pressure in the coming days.\"\n\nGiorgio Gori, Bergamo mayor, tweeted: \"It seems that the increase [in the number of cases] is slowing down, but it's only because we have no longer beds in intensive care (few are added with great effort). Patients who cannot be treated are left to die\"\n\nThere are signs that the system is already near capacity. In Veneto, which has 3.6 beds per 1,000 people, 80 per cent of the region's 450 intensive care beds were occupied as of Tuesday, with 67 of those taken by coronavirus patients.\n\nGovernment fears over the ability of the public health system to absorb the strain have prompted Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, to place nationwide restrictions on internal movement and public gatherings.\n\n\"The numbers tell us that we are having a large growth in people in intensive care and, unfortunately, the deceased,\" Mr Conte said.\n\nThe disparity between the number of available hospital beds in Italy's wealthier north and its poorer south -- the result of regional health services being centrally funded but regionally administered -- is another source of concern for experts: if the system in Lombardy is under intolerable strain, the consequences of a similar outbreak further south could be catastrophic.\n\nAs of Tuesday there were 341 cases in the Mezzogiorno, just 3.35 per cent of the country's total, with 37 people in intensive care.\n\nIn the south, poor management has resulted in swelling debts, with some local health authorities also being taken under central government control following Mafia infiltration.\n\nLombardy has 3.7 hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants, and 0.7 beds for longer-term illnesses according to the health ministry. Emilia-Romagna, another wealthy northern region, has 4 per 1,000 people, and 0.8 for long-term care. Last year, 700,000 southern Italians were forced to head north to receive healthcare, according to research by Bocconi University.\n\nThe southern region of Calabria -- with a gross domestic product per capita of \u20ac17,000, compared with a national average of \u20ac28,000 -- has 2.9 hospital beds per 1,000 residents, and 0.5 for long-term care. Campania and its capital Naples has 3 beds per 1,000 people.\n\n\"Calabria simply doesn't have the capacity to deal with an outbreak, there are not enough beds in intensive care departments to take in patients in serious condition,\" said Massimo Scura, a former Calabrian regional health commissioner. \"The system here just couldn't cope.\"\n\nThe Italian civil protection agency, which is in charge of co-ordinating the national crisis response, is moving to ensure the country will have enough medical supplies and equipment to cope with the spread of the virus.\n\nMassimo Scagliarini, chief executive of GVS Group, one of Italy's largest producers of surgical masks, said the agency had already asked his company to ramp up its production of masks -- from a current level of around 150,000 a month to 600,000 by the end of March. These will be used by medical staff, and also police and military personnel deployed on the streets of Italian towns and cities.\n\n\"The amounts of masks they need -- we are talking about millions,\" Mr Scagliarini said. \"The big problem being caused by the virus is that the hospitals do not have enough resources to manage critical care needs. The resources in critical care right now are not enough.\"\n\nDr Galli added: \"Some people still think that the measures in place are exaggerated. I would like to say to them to come and see what's going on in our departments.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

combat coronavirus on Thursday, moving the government to the \"delay\" phase and telling British people with even mild symptoms to stay at home for seven days.\n\nHowever, the prime minister said he would not follow the example of Ireland and Italy and close schools to limit the spread of the disease. \"We are not closing schools now, the scientific advice is this could do more harm than good.\" But he said that the advice would be under review.\n\nChris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said he currently expected the UK would reach the peak of its coronavirus outbreak in 10 to 14 weeks time. \"If you move too early, people get fatigued,\" he said, referring to the government's response. \"This is a long haul.\"\n\nSpeaking from Downing Street, the prime minister said his government had \"done what can be done to contain the disease\" but admitted \"this is the worst public health crisis for a generation\". Mr Johnson offered a stark warning about the dangers posed by the coronavirus.\n\n\"I must level with you, the British public. Many more families are going to lose their loved ones before their time,\" he said. Mr Johnson added that because of a lack of immunity, the coronavirus was more dangerous than ordinary flu and it was \"going to spread further\".\n\nFrom Friday, Mr Johnson said that anyone with coronavirus symptoms, including a cough or high temperature, must stay at home for seven days. In the coming weeks, everyone living in a household with someone who has those symptoms will be asked to stay at home.\n\nThe prime minister also advised those over 70 not to go on cruises and suggested international school trips should be cancelled.\n\nThe prime minister defended his government's decision to contain the disease in order to ease pressure on the NHS. \"If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we can also act to stretch the peak for a longer period so our society is better able to cope.\"\n\nPatrick Vallance, chief scientific officer, said that between 5,000 and 10,000 people in the UK will already have the virus and \"it is not possible to stop everyone getting it\". \"The actions we need to take are to delay the peak and to push the peak down.\"\n\nThe government is coming under increasing pressure to ban major public events, such as sporting fixtures. But Mr Johnson said it would have \"little effect\" on halting the spread of the disease. \"At all stages, we have been guided by science. We will do the right thing at the right time.\"\n\nAs the government's preparations ramp up, Mr Johnson warned that the UK would face \"severe disruption across the country for many months\" that would require the authorities to \"mobilise millions of people to help and support each other\". But he said: \"The government will do all it can to help you and your family.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

adviser stoked controversy on Friday when he said that about 40m people in the UK could need to catch the coronavirus to build up \"herd immunity\" and prevent the disease coming back in the future.\n\nDefending Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision not to follow other European countries by closing schools and banning mass gatherings, Patrick Vallance said it was the government's aim to \"reduce the peak of the epidemic, pull it down and broaden it\" while protecting the elderly and vulnerable.\n\nBut Sir Patrick told Sky News that experts estimated that about 60 per cent of the UK's 66m population would have to contract coronavirus in order for society to build up immunity.\n\n\"Communities will become immune to it and that's going to be an important part of controlling this longer term,\" he said. \"About 60 per cent is the sort of figure you need to get herd immunity.\"\n\nIn another interview with the BBC, Sir Patrick said: \"If you suppress something very, very hard, when you release those measures it bounces back and it bounces back at the wrong time.\"\n\nHe added: \"Our aim is to try to reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not suppress it completely; also, because the vast majority of people get a mild illness, to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission, at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable to it.\"\n\nA total of 798 people in the UK have so far tested positive for coronavirus, an increase of 208 since Thursday. Ten people are known to have died of it in the UK.\n\nDowning Street confirmed that the prime minister had decided to postpone May's local and mayoral elections for a year, amid fears they could coincide with the peak of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nElections were due to be held on May 7 for councils in England and Wales, the London Assembly and for mayors including those for London, the West Midlands and Liverpool, as well as police commissioners.\n\nThe polls were set to be the first electoral test for Mr Johnson since his general election victory in December as well as a significant moment for Labour's new leader -- the winner is due to be announced on April 4.\n\nOn Friday morning the pressure on Mr Johnson and his scientific and medical advisers to take more drastic action more quickly grew when opposition leaders, including Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, challenged England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries and minister of care Helen Whately on why the UK was taking such a different approach to other countries.\n\nAn official with knowledge of the meeting said Ms Harries \"came under sustained pressure\" and \"the meeting was quite fractious\".\n\nThey added: \"It was difficult and lots of opposition MPs had a range of concerns with the government's position.\"\n\nMr Johnson's decision on Thursday to introduce staged interventions -- starting with asking people with a new cough or a temperature to self-isolate for seven days -- has been criticised as too timid by politicians.\n\nThe prime minister is also under pressure because some neighbouring countries, including Ireland, France and Belgium, are taking much tougher measures, including banning sports fixtures. On Friday, England's football authorities said all professional games were being postponed until April 3, including Premier League and Football League matches.\n\nJeremy Hunt, former health secretary, on Thursday led the attack against Mr Johnson, arguing that countries such as Thailand and Singapore, which have most successfully contained the coronavirus, had adopted stringent \"social distancing\" measures early on in the outbreak.\n\nJohn McDonnell, shadow chancellor, called on the prime minister to launch an international intervention to agree a global co-ordinated response, and accused Mr Johnson of having \"self-isolated\" himself from his responsibilities.\n\n\"We are saying to Boris Johnson, bluntly, get off your backside and show some international leadership,\" he said. \"That is what UK prime ministers of all political colours have traditionally done.\"\n\nA Liberal Democrat spokesman said: \"We maintain our confidence in the CMO [chief medical officer], the experts and the decisions we are making.\n\n\"What we are disappointed with is the way Conservative ministers have communicated that information. We feel they haven't really made a clear enough case as to why our position is so radically different to other countries.\n\n\"We aren't saying it's the wrong advice, it's just that we feel there is increasing concern that people don't know what's going on.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

quarter over the next six months and implementing drastic cost cutting measures in response to the spread of the coronavirus into Europe and North America, the Australian airline said on Tuesday.\n\nIn total, a 23 per cent cut in international capacity and 5 per cent reduction in domestic flights is the equivalent of grounding 38 Qantas and Jetstar aircraft across the group's international and domestic network.\n\nThe biggest capacity reductions remain focused on Asia, which is now down 31 per cent compared to the same time last year.

But it has moved to strengthen its balance sheet by cancelling a planned A$150m share buyback, asking staff to take paid or unpaid leave and implementing a 30 per cent pay cut for group executive management and board members.\n\nAlan Joyce, Qantas chief executive and chairman, Richard Goyder, will take no salary or board fees for the remainder of 2020.\n\n\"In the past fortnight we've seen a sharp drop in bookings on our international network as the global coronavirus spread continues,\" said Mr Joyce. \"We expect lower demand to continue for the next several months, so rather than taking a piecemeal approach we're cutting capacity out to mid-September.\"\n\nThe recent collapse in fuel prices will have a limited impact on costs, with Qantas estimating its total fuel bill at A$3.74bn ($2.5bn), down from the A$3.85bn estimated on February 20th.

West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, fell to $27.71 a barrel.\n\nBut why did the world's top exporter decided to move so aggressively, with demand reeling from the coronavirus crisis? And what does it mean for the wider oil industry?\n\nSaudi Arabia had wanted to lead Opec and Russia in making deeper cuts to oil production to support crude prices in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, which has disrupted global economic activity. But when Russia baulked at the plan, the Gulf kingdom turned on an ally it had worked with to prop up the oil market since 2016.\n\nRiyadh responded by raising production and offering its crude at steep discounts. Analysts said that was an attempt to punish Russia for abandoning the so-called Opec+ alliance.\n\nSaudi Arabia may also have wished to cement its position as the world's top oil exporter, analysts added. The move demonstrated that Riyadh was willing to openly take on Russia and other higher cost producers.\n\n\"There was a consensus among Opec [to cut production]. Russia objected and has said that from April 1 everyone can produce whatever they like. So the kingdom too is exercising its right,\" said one person familiar with Saudi oil policy.\n\nAnalysts have questioned the wisdom of Saudi Arabia's approach. Its economy is not immune to a price crash, even if it believes it can win market share from its rivals.\n\nBut under Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince, the kingdom has gained a reputation for risky and unpredictable moves when it has felt the need to assert itself.\n\nRussia said it wanted to see the full impact of the coronavirus on oil demand before taking action.\n\nBut Moscow has also been keen to test the US shale industry. It believes that cutting output would only hand a lifeline to a sector whose growth has turned the US into the world's largest oil producer, gaining customers at Russia's expense.\n\nUS sanctions on Russian energy companies, including those that targeted the trading arm of state-backed oil champion Rosneft last month, and attempts to halt the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, have infuriated the Kremlin.\n\nUS shale has struggled to be profitable despite its growth over the past decade. People briefed on Moscow's strategy said Russia thought there was an opportunity to hurt the US oil industry.\n\n\"The total volume of oil that was reduced as a result of the repeated extension of the Opec+ agreement was completely and quickly replaced in the world market with American shale oil,\" a spokesman for Rosneft said on Sunday.\n\nSaudi Arabia's approach to a possible deal with Russia was a take-it-or-leave-it demand to join them in reducing an additional 1.5m barrels a day, taking total cuts to 3.6m b/d or roughly 4 per cent of global supply. That is thought to have riled Moscow, which does not see itself as a junior partner.\n\nThe price crash came at a difficult time for US shale. While production has soared over the past decade, leapfrogging that of Russia and Saudi Arabia, the industry has burnt through borrowed cash, alienating investors.\n\nThat has left it vulnerable to a drop in prices. The huge oil price fall since the start of the year has thrown any remaining expansion plans into doubt.\n\nThe hit to production, however, may be muted. Many of the small independent producers that make up most of the US shale sector have hedged their output at higher prices. Supply is unlikely to fall immediately.\n\n\"In our view, US shale production will not decrease fast enough to vindicate the Russian views on curbing it,\" said Ayham Kamel, head of Eurasia Group's Middle East and North Africa practice.\n\nBut many shale producers could struggle to secure new financing to roll over their existing debts. Many junk bonds -- those rated as below investment grade -- issued by energy companies are traded in distressed territory.\n\nFor President Donald Trump the price crash had posed a conundrum. Lower oil prices are an important part of his pitch to voters, frequently calling on Opec to bring them down. But a prolonged price fall could spell economic trouble for energy-producing states such as Texas and North Dakota.\n\nHopes for an oil price recovery in the short-term have been pinned on the coronavirus outbreak being contained faster than expected.\n\nTraders have warned that global oil demand in 2020 could contract for the first time since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Oil consumption could be at least 1-2 per cent lower this year than what analysts had expected at the beginning of the year, with demand taking a hit from restrictions on air and road travel.\n\nBut with the possibility of the coronavirus developing into a global pandemic, crude's short-term prospects look bleak.\n\nMuch depends on how aggressively Saudi Arabia will raise production. It has more spare capacity than any other country, so it can boost output quickly and potentially add more than 1m b/d in the coming months. It can also pull oil out of storage to increase exports.\n\nRussia's ability to boost its output is probably more constrained. Lower prices could jeopardise President Vladimir Putin's longer-term promises to invest in areas such as infrastructure and social spending.\n\nSaudi Arabia may have hoped that the enormity of the price fall would force Russia to return to the negotiating table, but that seems unlikely.\n\n\"This new Saudi approach will only harden Russia's position,\" said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects.\n\nIf very low prices persist, other oil producers will eventually be forced to scale back expansion plans or their output could drop owing to a lack of investment. But that could take a long time and oil demand growth was already forecast to slow in the second half of the decade. Betting on a quick price recovery looks premature.\n\nAfter oil prices crashed in 2014 the likes of Royal Dutch Shell, BP and ExxonMobil retrenched.\n\nThey cut costs aggressively, sold off assets and streamlined their operations to stay profitable at lower oil prices and protect their business from market slides.\n\nBut while they have become more efficient, generating more cash when prices averaged around $65 a barrel over the past two years than when they traded at $100, they face different pressures.\n\nCompanies have been desperate to maintain dividends and payouts to shareholders unsettled by predictions oil demand could peak in the next decade. At the same time they need to reduce debt and look to new energy sources such as renewables, fearing a long-term shift away from fossil fuels.\n\nWith oil at less than $40 a barrel, many investors doubt this is possible. Share prices will probably come under pressure in the coming days.\n\n\"Highly leveraged companies will be most impacted by the decline in crude prices,\" said Bernstein analyst Neil Beveridge.",

trying to come up with a vaccine against coronavirus from moving its research to the US, amid fears Washington may seek a monopoly on any breakthrough in the fight against the disease.\n\nA German government source said that ministers were looking at ways to keep the company in question, biopharma group CureVac, in Germany.\n\nOn Sunday the German newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag reported that Donald Trump was trying to lure CureVac to the US with generous offers of money.\n\nWelt quoted unnamed German officials as saying the president was doing everything in his power to acquire a vaccine for the US -- \"but only for the US\".\n\nThe report has reinforced fears in Berlin that countries could take an \"every man for himself\" approach to fighting coronavirus, rather than pooling resources and sharing potential scientific breakthroughs that would help to stop the disease.\n\nA German government spokesman declined to comment on the Welt story. But the health ministry issued a statement saying the government had \"a great interest in ensuring that vaccines and compounds against the new type coronavirus are also developed in Germany and in Europe\".\n\n\"With this in mind, the government is in an intensive exchange with the firm CureVac,\" the ministry added.\n\nGerman officials have pointed to Berlin's law on foreign trade, under which the government can scrutinise bids from non-EU countries \"if national or European security interests are at stake\".\n\nA US official said the Welt story was \"wildly overplayed\". He said the US government had spoken with more than 25 companies that claim they can help with a vaccine, and most of them had already received seed funding from US investors.\n\n\"We will continue to talk to any company that claims to be able to help,\" he said. \"And any solution found would be shared with the world.\"\n\nThis month, CureVac reported on its website that its chief executive Daniel Menichella had been invited to the White House to discuss \"strategies and opportunities for the rapid development and production of a coronavirus vaccine\" with Mr Trump and members of his coronavirus task force.\n\nIn the press release, Mr Menichella was quoted as saying that the company was \"very confident that we will be able to develop a potent vaccine candidate within a few months\". It said it hoped to start clinical trials early this summer.\n\nA few days after the meeting, Mr Menichella left the company, which is based in the south-western town of T\u00fcbingen. He was replaced as chief by Ingmar Hoerr, CureVac's founder.\n\nThe Welt report kicked up a political storm in Germany. \"The exclusive sale of a potential vaccine to the US must be prevented using all available means,\" said Karl Lauterbach, health policy spokesman for the Social Democrats, the junior partner in Angela Merkel's grand coalition government.\n\n\"Capitalism has limits,\" he tweeted. \"We can't continue to be reliant on medicine from China and the US. Our policy on research needs to change.\"\n\n\"It's an ethical, not an economic or national issue,\" said B\u00e4rbel Bas, deputy head of the SPD's parliamentary group. \"If there's a vaccine, it must be available for everyone. Anything else would be a scandal.\n\n\"In a pandemic, it's about everyone, not 'America First',\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors":

deeper production cuts in the face of plunging demand owing to the coronavirus outbreak, effectively launching a price war. Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped from $45 a barrel to as low as $31.02.\n\nThe price crash ricocheted through global equity and bond markets.

Futures markets tipped the FTSE 100 to drop 3.7 per cent.\n\nJapan's benchmark Topix fell as much as 5 per cent, meeting the technical definition of a bear market, or a 20 per cent fall from its recent peak. The yen -- seen as a haven during times of uncertainty -- strengthened as much as 3.6 per cent against the dollar to \u00a5101.62, or a more than three-year high.\n\nSydney's S&P/ASX 200 fell 6.1 per cent and was on track for its worst one-day fall since the global financial crisis, while China's CSI 300 shed 2.7 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 4 per cent.\n\n\"No one is immune in this environment,\" said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\nGold -- another haven asset -- jumped 1.3 per cent to $1,694.42 per ounce, a more than seven-year high. \"Investors are willing to absorb the blow with no income if they can hedge themselves in Treasuries and other government bonds,\" Mr Hui said of investors' hunt for safer assets.\n\nThe US dollar lost ground against its international peers, with the dollar index dropping 0.5 per cent. The euro gained as much as 1 per cent to $1.1394, an eight-month high.\n\nOil benchmarks later pared losses but both Brent and US marker West Texas Intermediate were down more than 25 per cent at $33.80 and $30.59 a barrel, respectively.\n\nThe currencies of oil-producing countries fell.

\"wicked cocktail\" of coronavirus and the dramatic action to limit its spread, according to four former IMF chief economists.\n\nAs the virus has spread from China to the rest of the world, economists no longer feel they have to wait for data to confirm the world is in recession, even though official forecasts remain more optimistic.\n\nThe former top officials agreed that addressing the public health needs was the first priority, but said that with a sharp downturn likely, governments should be preparing to spend significant sums to protect businesses and households.\n\nServing policymakers and officials have so far sought to contain alarm over the economic consequences of the coronavirus. Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, has declined to predict a UK recession while Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank president, said only that it would be a \"major shock\".\n\nGita Gopinath, IMF chief economist, said it was hard to predict what might happen but that the pandemic did not look like a normal recession. Data from China has shown a much steeper drop in services than a normal downturn would predict for instance.\n\n\"There's not an easy lesson,\" Ms Gopinath said, adding: \"This should be a transitory shock if there is an aggressive policy response that can stop [it] morphing into a major financial crisis.\"\n\nShe also said there was no reason why the economic effects of a health crisis should linger, in the way that long periods of slow growth have tended to follow financial crises as households and companies work off their debts.\n\nBut her predecessors at the IMF were less guarded in their assessment. Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard University professor, said: \"A global recession seems baked in a cake at this point with odds over 90 per cent.\"\n\nMaurice Obstfeld, a professor at University of California, Berkeley, said recent events were \"a wicked cocktail for the global growth\". He added: \"I do not see how, given the events in China, Europe and the US, you are not going to see a severe slowdown.\"\n\nOlivier Blanchard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, said there was \"no question in my mind that [global economic] growth will be negative\" for the first six months of 2020. The second half would depend on when peak infection was reached, he said, adding that his \"own guess\" was that this period would probably be negative as well.\n\nRaghuram Rajan, professor at Chicago Booth School of Business and a former Indian central bank governor, said the depth of any economic hit would depend on the authorities' success in containing the pandemic, which he hoped would be decisive and rapid. \"Anything prolonged obviously creates more stress for the system,\" he said.\n\nA long outbreak could also lead to a second round of consequences, where workers were let go and there was another fall in demand, eroding long-term confidence, he warned. \"These kinds of effects -- firms closing down -- depend on how prolonged the first round is, and what steps we take to alleviate that first round. So it is up in the air,\" he said.\n\nThe IMF defines a global recession as being when growth -- normally about 3.5 to 4 per cent a year -- falls below 2.5 per cent. Not all of the IMF alumni believe this definition is sensible in the circumstances but all said the conditions for a global recession were met regardless of the precise definition.\n\nThe IMF has said that the impact of the virus will be \"significant\" and that growth in 2020 will be lower than in 2019, which was 2.9 per cent.\n\nTo help offset the slowdown Profs Obstfeld and Rajan called for cash help to vulnerable households while Prof Blanchard said it was necessary to \"prepare fiscal measures, including transfers and backstops to banks\". He concluded: \"Do whatever it takes.\"\n\nOther economists were also clear that the economic effects of coronavirus will be serious. V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, former vice-president of the European Central Bank, said: \"The recession is coming from a demand deficiency and the disturbance on the supply chains. The most affected sectors will be leisure amenities, tourism, travel, transportation, energy, financials.\"\n\nHe continued: \"[It is] possible that banks' risk aversion and lack of market liquidity for bond issuance may affect credit and provoke liquidity squeezes.\"\n\nErik Nielsen, chief economist of Italy's UniCredit, noted that four consecutive quarters of negative global growth followed the 2008 financial crisis but said he expected the impact of coronavirus to last only a couple of quarters. But he also predicted that the quarterly fall could be as deep as the 3.2 per cent contraction that the global economy experienced in the first quarter of 2009.\n\nGilles Moec, chief economist at French insurer Axa, said that trying to plot the disruption from the virus was almost impossible. \"Our forecasting models are not set up to deal with this scenario,\" he said.\n\nPointing to the lack of large-scale virus testing in the US, Danny Blanchflower, a Dartmouth College professor, said: \"The worst is yet to come\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I assume consumer confidence is going to collapse.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

"https://www.ft.com/content/0be9b456-6414-11ea-a6cd-df28cc3c6a68", "title": "Donald Trump's troubling coronavirus address", "body": "On Wednesday night the global pandemic met US nationalism. It will not take long to see which comes off best. As Donald Trump was speaking, the Dow futures market nosedived. His Europe travel ban came just a few hours after the US stock market entered bear territory -- a fall of 20 per cent or more -- for the first time since the global financial crisis. It also followed the World Health Organization's declaration of a global pandemic. Mr Trump's address was meant to calm the waters. By the time he finished they were considerably rougher.\n\nHis purpose was to convey that he has a grip on the epidemic. Having spent weeks downplaying the threat, Mr Trump had already tied one of his arms behind his back. The previous day he told Americans to \"stay calm. This will go away.\" A few weeks ago he described the epidemic as a Democratic \"hoax'.\n\nThen on Wednesday night he pivoted. He suspended all travel from Europe for 30 days. For the first time since the second world war, direct US travel to the European continent will be closed off. He excluded the UK and Ireland from the ban despite the fact that Britain has almost half the number of US infections with less than a fifth of its population.\n\nMoreover, his action contradicted expert guidelines. The WHO clearly advises against international travel bans because they stifle the flow of medicines and aid, and \"may divert resources from other interventions\". Mr Trump has been badly shaken by the stock market fall that has wiped out most of the gains of his administration. Yet his actions will almost certainly deepen market pessimism. In addition to the chilling effect on transatlantic trade, Mr Trump has elevated the uncertainty risk. To put it bluntly, no one has much clue what he will do next.\n\nThe same applies to the confusing manner in which he is addressing the US economic fallout. Two weeks ago, Mr Trump said that the $8.5bn Democrats had requested to tackle the virus was too high. He only asked for $2.5bn. On Wednesday, he called for a three-month suspension of the payroll tax, which will cost taxpayers at least $300bn -- more than a 100 times larger.\n\nAt the same press conference two weeks ago, Mr Trump blamed the stock market decline on the previous night's Democratic presidential debate. On Wednesday he had still not shaken off the idea that the coronavirus was a conspiracy to deny him re-election.\n\nPerhaps the biggest fallout of Mr Trump's address was what he did not say. His most glaring omission was any plan to increase America's capacity to test for infections. Epidemiologists say accurate testing is the single most effective method to counter the disease's spread. It allows the authorities to isolate clusters, trace the movement of the virus and make critical decisions on where the biggest risks lie. That is what countries such as Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea have done so effectively without resorting to the draconian measures taken in China.\n\nThe US has tested fewer than 6,000 people out of a population of 327m. By contrast, the Netherlands, with 17m people, is testing that many every day. South Korea, with 51m people, is testing 10,000 a day. The shortage of US kits stems from federal bureaucratic delays. One simple fix would be to import them from Germany, which are WHO-approved.\n\nMr Trump said nothing about tests other than that health insurers would waive co-pay charges on those being tested. That moderate incentive is irrelevant until the US has a capacity to screen more people. Mr Trump could have tackled the problem at a stroke by saying the US would import as many kits as necessary. But that would have undercut the spirit of his message: the epidemic comes from a \"foreign virus\", he said; America must therefore narrow its access to the world.\n\nIt is unclear how Europe and other countries will respond to Mr Trump's dramatic announcement. In an ideal situation, America's president would have acknowledged that the pathogen knows no borders and has no political loyalties. It poses a common threat that requires a co-ordinated global response.\n\nThat is not the way Mr Trump thinks. Public health officials say that millions of Americans will probably be infected. The official total now stands at 1.281. Mr Trump has never faced a crisis on anything like this scale -- and it is still in its early stages. His remedies so far are cause for deep concern. Who will he blame when they fail?", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type":

Princess operates the Diamond Princess ship, which had some of the early cases of coronavirus.\n\nShares in Tui have fallen 57 per cent in the past month and the cost of insuring its debt has jumped almost fourfold since mid-February.\n\nOne Greek hotelier who contracts around 15 per cent of his rooms to Tui said that forward bookings were down around 40 per cent and that as tour operators moved to freeze payments he would also be forced to cut payouts to suppliers.\n\nThe first quarter of the year is always difficult for tour operators: demand for holidays is low and they must make advance payment to hoteliers for summer bookings. Tui has also been affected by the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft -- this cost the company \u20ac293m last year and the estimated earnings hit in 2020 is up to \u20ac400m.\n\nIn addition, there has been a surge in coronavirus cases in Spain this week. Spain is by far the largest market for UK overseas tourism with 16m travelling there last year, according to the Association of British Travel Agents.\n\nBecky Lane, an analyst at Jeffries, said that Tui was \"more stretched\" than its peers and that a large amount of the \u20ac2.9bn cash on Tui's balance sheet at the end of 2019 would be from customer deposits that might have to be refunded.\n\nAccording to its latest trading update in February, Tui had net debt of just over \u20ac2bn.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [],

public health crisis for a generation\", but the prime minister is facing tough questions about why he is not taking more draconian measures to tackle coronavirus.\n\nMr Johnson's decision to ask people with a persistent new cough to stay at home -- coupled with a ban on school trips and a suggestion that the elderly avoid cruise ships -- came against a backdrop of far tougher action elsewhere.\n\nWith Italy in lockdown, Donald Trump banning flights from the EU and the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar closing schools and sports events, Mr Johnson insisted his measured strategy of doing \"the right things at the right time\" was correct.\n\nBut Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, criticised Mr Johnson and his advisers for failing to follow countries such as Thailand and Taiwan, which he said had successfully contained the virus through tough \"social distancing\" policies.\n\n\"People will be surprised we are not moving sooner on social distancing,\" he told Channel 4 News on Thursday evening. He said it was strange that Mr Johnson had not, for example, ordered a stop to external visits to elderly care homes.\n\nChris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, said the \"reasonable worst-case scenario\" was that 80 per cent of Britain's 66m population would be infected, with an expected mortality rate of 1 per cent or less. On that calculation a worst case death toll could be in the region of 500,000.\n\nThe British approach is nevertheless to try to delay the peak of the epidemic and flatten it out, pushing the crisis into the summer months when the health service is under less pressure. But Mr Johnson accepts that it cannot be stopped.\n\nScientific opinion is divided about whether the UK has done enough so far to stem the UK epidemic but some experts said the country's actions were too little too late and that even now Mr Johnson was not taking sufficiently robust action.\n\nDevi Sridhar, Professor of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, said the time had come for the UK government to ban large gatherings, ask people to stop non-essential travel, and recommend employers shift to home working.\n\n\"The curve can be shifted, like South Korea and Singapore, but only with government action,\" said Ms Sridhar.\n\nSingapore has won praise for taking swift action against the coronavirus and for its thorough tracing of patients' close contacts. It was one of the first countries to close its borders to Chinese nationals, in late January.\n\nThe country has also used tools including dedicated tracers, security camera footage and police investigators to track down contacts linked to infected individuals. Singapore has so far identified 4,550 close contacts who have all been quarantined. The city state of 5.7 million people has had 187 confirmed cases and no deaths.\n\nTesting in Britain of people showing mild symptoms of coronavirus has now stopped and the \"contain\" phase in the UK was never seen by Mr Johnson's team as anything other than a short-term measure to delay the progress of the outbreak.\n\nThe limitations of the UK testing regime is illustrated by the fact that while 590 cases had been detected by Thursday, Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser, said that between 5,000 and 10,000 people were likely to have the disease.\n\nChris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents leaders across the health service, rejected suggestions that coronavirus testing capacity could have been increased faster. In the last two weeks health chiefs handling the outbreak at NHS England had focused on expanding testing capacity \"as quickly as possible\".\n\n\"We've done that well and while you always want more capacity, going from 1,500 tests a day to 10,000 a day -- increasing capacity nearly seven fold in a very short space of time -- is very reasonable\", he said.\n\nSir Patrick and Professor Whitty, insist that their strategy was achieving its desired effect of slowing and managing the outbreak, as they attempt to build long-term \"herd immunity\" in Britain to the new disease.\n\n\"It's not possible to stop everyone getting it and it's also not desirable because you want some immunity in the population to protect ourselves in the future,\" Sir Patrick said. He wants to flatten the peak of the outbreak by 50 per cent and reduce the death rate among the elderly by 20-30 per cent by isolating them at the peak of the outbreak.\n\nSir Patrick argued that taking tough action now when the virus was not widespread -- for example isolating households where a family member was sick or sealing off the elderly -- would be counterproductive.\n\nSuch measures would only have to be repeated later when the virus was at its peak -- expected to be in 10-14 weeks' time -- while in the meantime the elderly would be left lonely and isolated.\n\nPeople, who stayed at home but did not contract the virus, would become \"fatigued\" by repeated self-quarantine. Closing sports events would have a very limited effect which could be offset by people watching games in pubs or with friends in homes.\n\nClosing schools, a measure which could come further down the line, would also have limited impact now while the virus was at a low level. Vital NHS workers would have to stay at home with their children, or pupils might be sent to vulnerable grandparents, Sir Patrick said.\n\nJimmy Whitworth, professor of International Public Health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told the FT that under UK conditions it would be a defensible political decision not to try to stop the epidemic but to flatten its peak and push it into the summer.\n\n\"Ultimately it is more a political than a scientific decision,\" said Prof Whitworth. \"The general public have to buy into what is decided.\"\n\nMaintaining public support for this measured response, especially when a neighbouring country like Ireland is taking much tougher action, will prove a challenge for Mr Johnson, who insists he will always follow the advice of scientists.\n\nRichard Horton, chief editor of medical journal The Lancet, said: \"The evidence is clear. We need urgent implementation of social-distancing and closure policies. The government is playing roulette with the public. This is a major error.\"\n\nMr Johnson refutes that charge categorically, arguing that his strategy is to introduce the most drastic measures at the time when they will be most effective -- when coronavirus is at its peak -- not to take knee-jerk action now.\n\n\"We are guided by the science in everything we do,\" he told a Downing Street press conference, flanked again by Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty. The prime minister's scientific and medical advisers are not just shaping Mr Johnson's strategy; they are an invaluable political shield as the coronavirus outbreak enters a dangerous new phase.",

have each taken a different approach to testing, leading to questions about which strategy has been most successful.\n\nOfficial data suggest the rate of new infections in China, where the outbreak started, and South Korea is slowing.\n\nBut while some experts have heralded the results as early signs of success, others warn that there might be problems with under-testing and accuracy, raising awkward questions for global policymakers. In the US, where Donald Trump has contradicted his own officials over the crisis, authorities have been accused of not testing aggressively enough.\n\nHow have the Asian countries facing the biggest outbreaks and Italy, the European country with the biggest crisis, used testing?\n\nCoronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people and killed more than 3,000 in mainland China, but the number of new infections reported each day is declining, according to the government. On Tuesday, authorities said the number of new cases had fallen to their lowest level since January.\n\nBeijing said that showed its sweeping lockdown of millions of people had worked.\n\nEpidemiologists, however, warn that a lack of testing capacity has led to a vast undercounting of the number of coronavirus cases. China's propensity to exclude less severe cases from their testing regime means the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases is 3.91 per cent, which is probably a higher figure than if more people were tested.\n\nThe problem is particularly acute in the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated.\n\nWang Jing, a nurse at Wuhan Union Hospital West, said her hospital \"needed to be stingy\" with test kits. At the beginning of the outbreak, \"if the patient wasn't displaying serious symptoms, then a test kit shouldn't be wasted\", she said.\n\nSupply of test kits has improved and Ms Wang is now trying to test her hospital's backlog of \"suspected cases\". But she is still asked to use discretion when deciding who to test.\n\nThe problem of testing capacity in China is exacerbated by the low sensitivity of the tests: Chinese experts say that only 30-50 per cent of positive cases are detected with the kits available in the country.\n\nTo avoid sampling errors clouding understanding of how the virus is spreading, Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, suggested periodic testing of a random sample to track the spread of the disease.\n\nSouth Korea on Wednesday reported 242 additional coronavirus cases, taking the total caseload to 7,755. The increase came after the identification of a new cluster of infections at a call centre in Seoul and marked a reversal of four consecutive days of declining new infections.\n\nSeoul has rolled out a mass public testing programme in response to an outbreak spreading from Daegu, the country's fourth-biggest city. Officials have sought to test anyone who might have been exposed to the virus, including many asymptomatic patients as well as those with symptoms. More than 210,000 tests have been conducted with as many as 10,000-new tests conducted each day. The mortality rate has remained below 1 per cent.\n\n\"For controlling the epidemic, the best information you have is these tests, which tell you who is positive and who is not,\" said Kee Park, a lecturer at Harvard Medical School.\n\nHong Ki-ho, a doctor at Seoul Medical Centre, believed the accuracy of the country's coronavirus tests was \"99 per cent -- the highest in the world\". He pointed to the rapid commercial development and deployment of new test kits enabled by a fast-tracked regulatory process.\n\n\"We have allowed test kits based on WHO protocols and never followed China's test methods,\" Dr Hong said.\n\nHowever, Choi Jae-wook, a medical professor of preventive medicine at Korea University, remained \"worried\".\n\n\"Many of the kits used at the beginning stage of the outbreak were the same as those in China where the accuracy was questioned\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009We have been hesitating to voice our concern because this could worry the public even more,\" Mr Choi said.\n\nFor weeks after the outbreak began, Japan only tested people with links to Wuhan, the heart of China's outbreak, giving officials little chance to detect early domestic infections.\n\nJapan has tested fewer than 10,000 people and there have been 513 confirmed diagnoses, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Some patients first visited a doctor with symptoms a week or 10 days before they were tested.\n\nCritics claim the government is trying to minimise the number of cases to rescue this summer's Tokyo Olympics.\n\nBut Yasuyuki Sahara, senior assistant minister at MHLW, said the reality was more prosaic: limited capacity to perform the polymerase chain reaction tests used to confirm the presence of the virus.\n\n\"Initially, we could only do PCR tests at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, but now that's expanding to universities, quarantine stations and private companies,\" he said.\n\nTokyo has prioritised testing accuracy over volume, with centralised control over who was tested. That explains why South Korea was able to increase testing when Japan could not.\n\n\"The PCR tests we are doing are not necessarily the same as those in South Korea. PCR tests vary in speed and sensitivity,\" said Mr Sahara. \"In Japan, we've put great importance on providing an extremely accurate PCR test.\"\n\nWith Shinzo Abe, prime minister, under pressure, the authorities have relaxed the requirement for Wuhan contact and plan to cover coronavirus tests on national health insurance.\n\nThe number of tests carried out, however, is still falling short of Japan's claimed capacity of 4,000 a day.\n\nItaly has quarantined the entire country after an outbreak that started in the north of the country turned into a national crisis. The death toll has leapt to more than 600 and confirmed cases exceed 10,000.\n\nItaly has tested anyone who might have been exposed to the virus, as well as those with symptoms.\n\n\"Especially during the initial stage of the contagion, the strategy of over testing was certainly right and sensible. At a time when the problem was minor, authorities decided to make an assessment of the situation\" said Fabrizio Pregliasco, a virologist at the University of Milan.\n\n\"This was useful to track suspicious cases and to try to trace how the virus had spread as thoroughly as possible.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

and Rishi Sunak, the UK chancellor, unveiled other measures designed to contain the impact on businesses of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBut these initiatives distract attention from government decisions on Brexit that threaten to have a bigger, long-term impact on the UK's economy and its place in the international order.\n\nFor the longer Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds power, the faster Brexit is evolving into a project more extreme than most British people thought likely or desirable at the time of the UK's 2016 referendum.\n\nThe pattern is familiar from other revolutions in modern history, whether violent or not. Brexit is in its Jacobin phase, for how long remains to be seen.\n\nThere is no better recent example of the radicalisation of Brexit than the government's disclosure last week that it intends to take the UK out of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, the EU body that upholds safety standards in the air industry.\n\nIn a coruscating article, Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the trade group that represents the British aerospace and defence industry, condemns this decision as \"unnecessary and unwanted divergence\" from EU norms and harmful to the UK aerospace sector.\n\nHe writes that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, made his announcement even though Michael Gove, Mr Johnson's right-hand man in the cabinet, and other ministers had promised to consult the aerospace industry, and to be guided by objective evidence rather than ideology, before taking a decision.\n\nThe government's defence is simple: Brexit must exclude involvement in any EU regulatory system. Pragmatic pan-European co-operation and the interests of business are therefore to be sacrificed on the altar of national independence.\n\nTo grasp how radical Brexit is becoming, compare the Johnson government's approach to the EU-UK negotiations that started on March 2 with positions outlined by London between 2017 and 2019.\n\nIn her January 2017 speech at Lancaster House, Theresa May, Mr Johnson's predecessor as prime minister and Conservative party leader, promised that \"as a priority, we will pursue a bold and ambitious free trade agreement with the European Union\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009a new strategic partnership between the UK and the EU.\"\n\nThis is emphatically not the aspiration of Mr Johnson's government. Instead he and his ministers are revelling in what Professor Chris Grey of Royal Holloway, University of London, calls \"sheer, dogmatic, remorseless antipathy to anything and everything remotely connected with the EU\".\n\nNext, consider the political declaration on future EU-UK relations to which the Johnson government agreed in October 2019. This set out a long list of areas for co-operation.\n\nFor example, it stipulated that EU-UK economic ties \"must ensure open and fair competition, encompassing robust commitments to ensure a level playing field\".\n\nNow the Johnson government has persuaded itself that its election victory in December gave it a mandate not to keep this promise.\n\nOn foreign and security policy, the joint EU-UK declaration said the two sides \"should establish structured consultation and thematic dialogues\". It mentioned two EU initiatives, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy, as suitable frameworks.\n\nNow Mr Johnson's government displays zero interest in these initiatives -- a stance that partly reflects the deep-seated disdain for the EU of Dominic Raab, foreign secretary.\n\nThe EU-UK political declaration was not legally binding on either side.\n\nBut EU negotiators are increasingly concerned about the UK's willingness to honour the binding commitments on Northern Ireland's status contained in last year's UK withdrawal deal.\n\nThe Irish question may evolve into the acid test of how extreme Mr Johnson and his Brexit Jacobins really are.\n\nWanted: a shared vision of Britain to sell to go-it-alone Scots\n\nHow could Britishness be made to feel relevant after the Brexit polarisation? Strategists, pollsters and politicians who attended all recognised that they need a fresh emotional message. Dry arguments about currency and trade may not cut it in an age in which the heart triumphs over the head. (Sebastian Payne, FT)\n\nUK's hardline Brexit stance starts to sour relations with business\n\nBefore the start of post-Brexit trade talks in Brussels last week, David Frost, Britain's chief negotiator, prepared by tucking into a full English breakfast. But from the end of the Brexit transition next January, ordering Mr Frost's patriotic fry-up in the EU's capital might become much more difficult. (Daniel Thomas, FT)\n\nBudget 2020: Sunak unveils stimulus to counter UK coronavirus shock\n\nRishi Sunak launched a fiscal stimulus package to counter the shock of the coronavirus outbreak in his first UK Budget, measures that aim to prepare for economic turbulence while also delivering on the Conservatives' pledge to address regional inequalities. (Sebastian Payne and Chris Giles, FT)\n\nCan UK infrastructure spending address regional deficits?

search for ventilators as doctors and hospitals prepare for a continuing surge in patients infected with the Covid-19 virus.\n\nItaly, the country at the epicentre of the European outbreak, told the country's only ventilator manufacturer to quadruple monthly production, even deploying members of the armed forces to help meet the new quota.\n\nGermany has ordered an additional 10,000 ventilators from a domestic supplier and France is conducting a study into its own stocks including outside the public health system to determine the adequate level or needs to order further supplies.\n\nVentilators are machines designed to put oxygen into the lungs of patients with acute respiratory difficulties. They are of critical importance for those in danger of lung failure, a typical cause of death for patients infected with the coronavirus.\n\nIn Italy, where medical staff have been told to prioritise the patients with the highest chances of survival because of the lack of the equipment, the country's only producer Siare Engineering was asked by the government to start producing 500 ventilators a month, up from 125.\n\nWith more than 17,660 people infected, including 1,328 patients in intensive care, the country is fighting the biggest outbreak of the disease outside of China, where the virus emerged.\n\nSiare Engineering -- based in the northern province of Bologna, in one of the country's most affected regions -- has cancelled all orders from abroad. It is now only producing for Italy, Gianluca Preziosa, the managing director, said.\n\n\"All of a sudden, we found ourselves facing an operation of titanic proportions: we had to produce in a couple of months what this company would normally produce in two years,\" Mr Preziosa wrote on Facebook on Thursday.\n\nSiare Engineering is expected to deliver 2,000 ventilators by the end of July. The Italian army is expected to send 25 trained technicians next week to help increase production. Each ventilator costs \u20ac17,000.\n\nGerman manufacturer Dr\u00e4gerwerk AG said in a regulatory statement on Friday that the order by the federal government would be stretched over the entire year.\n\nThe L\u00fcbeck-based company, one of the world's leading producers of ventilators, added: \"For this, the production capacity in L\u00fcbeck will be expanded considerably. In addition, Dr\u00e4ger will also deliver personal protection equipment for hospital personnel. Both will help shore up the service in the healthcare sector also with regard to the spread of the coronavirus.\"\n\nGerman hospitals already are among the best equipped in Europe when it comes to both intensive care beds and the availability of ventilators. According to the government, Germany has around 28,000 intensive care beds, of which 25,000 are equipped with ventilators.\n\nA spokesman for Spectaris, the German industry federation that represents medical devices makers, said: \"At the moment there are sufficient supplies of everything. What is important is to keep the number of new infections low. Otherwise we could see shortages.\"\n\nFrance, where President Emmanuel Macron announced the closures of all schools and universities from Monday because of the spreading virus, has 5,065 intensive care beds equipped with ventilators. However, health officials caution that many are already occupied by patients receiving medical care. It has another 7,364 intensive care beds that lack ventilators.\n\nMeanwhile in Madrid, which accounts for about half of Spain's 4,334 coronavirus patients as of Friday, doctors and local authorities have been pleading with the central government for more equipment.\n\n\"We need more supplies,\" said Enrique Ruiz Escudero, the top medical official of the Madrid region, as he issued an \"SOS\" to central government. Ventilators are a key concern as local authorities in the capital city seek to triple intensive care beds in coming days.\n\nHospital staff hold told the Spanish press that their regular suppliers do not have products in stock and have criticised Germany for imposing export controls -- which Berlin has pledged to relax.\n\nAs European countries fear shortages and requisition domestic production, China is lending a helping hand, donating medical supplies, including 40 ventilators, to Italy.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [],

members of the European Central Bank's governing council for her botched communication about its new monetary policy strategy which triggered a bond market sell-off last week.\n\nSpeaking to the ECB's top decision-making body in a call on Friday, the central bank's president said she was sorry for comments that led to the biggest single-day fall in Italian government bonds in a decade, two people involved in the call told the Financial Times.\n\nIn Thursday's press conference Ms Lagarde said it was not the ECB's role to \"close the spread\" in sovereign debt markets -- referring to the gap between Italian and German bond yields that is a key risk indicator for Italy.\n\nThe remarks stirred fears the ECB was retreating from being a lender of last resort to Italy just as concerns intensified about the economic impact of coronavirus, which has infected more than 21,000 Italians and killed more 1,400. Economists predict Italy is heading into a deep recession, while the country's \u20ac25bn of extra spending will inflate its already high debt levels.\n\nIn Thursday's press conference Ms Lagarde also rebuffed suggestions that she hoped to emulate the legacy of Mario Draghi, her Italian predecessor as ECB president whom she replaced in November, saying that she did not seek to be \"whatever it takes, number two\".\n\nHer apology at the start of a conference call to discuss a different matter on Friday was welcomed by several ECB governing council members, who had been unsettled by her comments to the media.\n\n\"It was a mistake by the president but she immediately reacted to correct it and she apologised,\" said one. \"This will be very bad if it lasts. But my impression is that she doesn't really think that.\"\n\nThe ECB declined to comment on Sunday.\n\nMs Lagarde backpedalled quickly after her press conference by stating in a televised interview that she was \"fully committed to avoid any fragmentation in a difficult moment for the euro area\".\n\nThe ECB's chief economist, Philip Lane, also sought to reassure investors that the central bank was not leaving Italy to fend for itself, after the country went into lockdown to halt the rapid spread of the virus. In a blog post he said the central bank was \"ready to do more\" to contain any sovereign debt stress.\n\nAnother governing council member said: \"She just lost concentration. It was her first major policy decision and it was a very complicated situation. I think her mind was somewhere else.\"\n\nThe two governing council members said they still thought Ms Lagarde was the right person to lead the ECB.\n\nHowever, Ms Lagarde's comments were applauded in parts of Europe, particularly in Germany. \"As President Lagarde rightly said, it is not for the eurosystem to reduce interest rate differentials,\" a group of mostly retired senior German officials wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper on Sunday.\n\nThe group, including former Bavarian prime minister Edmund Stoiber, former German finance minister Peer Steinbr\u00fcck and former German economy minister Wolfgang Clement, also called for the ECB to start raising interest rates \"after the [coronavirus] crisis has subsided\".\n\nUnlike Mr Draghi, who was best known for promising to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro from its debt crisis in 2012, Ms Lagarde is not an economist and she has little direct monetary policy experience. Soon after becoming French finance minister in 2007, Ms Lagarde was dubbed \"Madame la Gaffe\" when her plain-speaking style landed her in political hot water. But she was widely seen as a safe pair of hands in the financial crisis and in her eight years running the IMF.\n\nThe ECB last week announced plans for \u20ac120bn of extra asset purchases -- on top of its \u20ac20bn-a-month existing programme. Mr Lane said this showed it would have \"a more robust presence in the bond market during phases of heightened volatility\".\n\nThe new monetary policy package -- including more cheap loans and lower capital requirements for banks -- was agreed unanimously by the ECB governing council. But some members indicated they would have preferred a bigger \"envelope\" of extra bond purchases.\n\nThe ECB has bought a total of \u20ac2.6tn of assets, including about \u20ac364bn of Italian sovereign bonds, since starting the programme in 2015. This helped to bring interest rates across the eurozone down towards those of Germany, which has negative yields on almost all its government debt.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news",

of the movie Jaws was the \"laudable\" mayor Larry Vaughn, who kept his seaside town open for business in spite of apparent hysteria around a series of shark attacks.\n\n\"A gigantic fish is eating all your constituents and he decides to keep the beach open,\" Mr Johnson told a business audience. \"It turned out he was wrong. But it remains that he was heroically right in principle.\"\n\nThe prime minister, on the advice of his medical and scientific advisers, is trying to keep Britain open for business -- at least for now -- in the face of coronavirus, while around the world the shutters are being put up.\n\nMr Johnson, who said on Thursday that Britain was facing \"the greatest public health crisis for a generation\", is facing criticism from some politicians and scientists for failing to act sufficiently swiftly or decisively against Covid-19.\n\nBy refusing to bow to political pressure to take drastic action now -- such as by closing schools or isolating the elderly -- Mr Johnson accepts that the disease will spread widely in society.\n\nSome countries, such as Singapore or Hong Kong, have tried to quickly stamp out the disease with social distancing measures, but Patrick Vallance, Mr Johnson's chief scientific adviser, said it was desirable to build up \"herd immunity\" in the population to protect the country in the longer term.\n\n\"About 60 per cent is the sort of figure you need to get herd immunity,\" Sir Patrick told Sky News on Friday. That suggests up to 40m Britons might contract the disease under the government's plan. As Mr Johnson concedes, many loved ones will die.\n\nSince mid-February, as the virus morphed from a health issue into a national crisis, the prime minister's chief adviser Dominic Cummings has helped to shape Mr Johnson's approach, relying on scientific experts and communicating through simple messaging.\n\nMr Cummings has in the past expressed a personal interest in this topic. \"I am particularly interested in public health and the field of epidemiology,\" he wrote in 2016.\n\nBoth of the government's three-word mantras for coronavirus came out of focus groups, a favoured tool of Mr Cummings. Following his success with \"take back control\" in the 2016 Brexit referendum and \"get Brexit done\" in the 2019 general election, two messages underpin Mr Johnson's current strategy: \"wash your hands\" and \"stay at home\".\n\nThe prime minister and his scientific advisers hope to manage the epidemic by \"flattening the curve\" of infection and delaying the peak until the summer, when the National Health Service will face less seasonal pressure.\n\nThen -- or so the theory goes -- enough people will have acquired resistance to Covid-19 to avoid a second wave of disease next autumn or winter. Downing Street believes that other countries that have taken draconian action now will be vulnerable later in the year.\n\nMr Johnson's strategy depends on building up the so-called herd immunity. If a high enough proportion has become resistant through Covid-19 infection, the virus will not have enough new people to catch and the epidemic will not be able to sustain itself. It will burn out.\n\nBut the idea is not scientifically proven to work for this new virus, where the long-term effect on the immune system is unknown.\n\nRupert Beale, who runs the laboratory for cell biology of infection at London's Francis Crick Institute, a biomedical research centre, said: \"The problem is we don't know if herd immunity can be achieved. Other coronaviruses can reinfect a few months down the line. We don't know yet for Covid-19.\"\n\nMost medical experts say that no one will be able to assess the strength and duration of the human immune response to Covid-19 until people who have recovered have been studied for months.\n\nPaul Hunter, a communicable diseases specialist at the University of East Anglia, said: \"I will go out on a limb and suggest that the immunity will not last for a lifetime but will last for more than a few months -- possibly two or three years.\"\n\nHowever, illustrating the range of medical opinion, Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, was more optimistic.\n\n\"The evidence is increasingly convincing that infection with [Covid-19] leads to an antibody response that is protective,\" he said. \"Most likely this protection is for life, although we need more evidence to be sure of this. People who have recovered are unlikely to be infected again.\"\n\nSeasonal factors will also help the government's strategy of flattening and delaying the peak of the epidemic until the weather is warmer. Flu and other respiratory viruses are less prevalent in summer and many experts believe Covid-19 will behave in a similar way.\n\nMr Johnson and his pro-Brexit allies were prickly about the advice of \"experts\" during the 2016 EU referendum. Now the prime minister is taking a big political risk by backing them to the hilt on coronavirus.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [],

border, Sergio Tamborini is taking a defiant stance to the healthcare crisis that threatens to engulf his textiles business.\n\n\"The easiest thing would be to put the whole world under lockdown,\" Mr Tamborini said. \"But I decide to fight. It's time to fight. We are at war.\"\n\nHis fabric manufacturing company Ratti Spa works with major luxury brands, producing more than 4m metres of fabric a year. Exports account for approximately 80 per cent of its sales but it is located in Lombardy, the part of the country most affected by Europe's worst coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Italian government has imposed the most drastic curbs deployed in Europe so far to contain the spread of the virus, telling Italians to stay at home unless for emergencies or essential work-related purposes. Bars, restaurants, schools, universities, museums, sports centres and all retailers apart from pharmacies and food shops have been closed across the whole country. People have to be kept one metre apart, both in internal and external areas.\n\nThe retail and wholesale sector employs nearly 4m people, accounting for about 15 per cent of jobs, and contributes about 12 per cent of gross domestic product.\n\nEven if enforcement appears patchy, the toughest controls on personal movement since the second world war will play havoc with Italy's already weak economy, compounding supply disruptions -- such as those afflicting Mr Tamborini's textile business -- with a demand shock that could drive many smaller businesses to the wall and tip Italy into a painful recession.\n\nUBS, which had been expecting the Italian economy to eke out growth of 0.3 per cent this year, now expects it to contract by 0.4 per cent, or by 0.8 per cent in a \"negative scenario\".\n\nThe plight of consumers and businesses in the eurozone's third-largest economy will be at the forefront of policymakers' minds when the European Central Bank's governing council meets to consider a crisis response on Thursday. The fear is that the kind of economically-damaging confinement imposed in Italy could soon be required in many other parts of Europe.\n\n\"We are talking about bad, very bad or crisis scenarios,\" said one eurozone policymaker. \"We have moved into the very bad [scenario].\"\n\nThe Italian government hopes that allowing people to move around for work could save the economy from grinding to a complete halt. But the curbs could prove disastrous for the many small companies in the services sector, and particularly for tourism, which accounts for 6 per cent of GDP.\n\nAbout 1.7m people are employed in accommodation and food services, a sector that could suffer a 75 per cent fall in output as a consequence of the nationwide quarantine, according to Capital Economics.\n\nFederalberghi, an association of hotels, points out that many of these workers are on contracts of less than one year and do not qualify for redundancy benefits. The retail sector is also expected to be badly hit.\n\n\"It is the services industry that is being completely crushed,\" said Brunello Rosa, chief executive of Rosa & Roubini Associates, a consultancy. \"Imagine restaurants, cinemas, any sort of personal service. This [consumption] is not postponed but lost.\"\n\nAndrea Rucci said he had closed Playsound, a music recording business he set up in Milan, until at least April 3. \"The situation is really bad,\" he said. \"I have no money coming in at the moment.\"\n\nRome has increased the scale of a planned stimulus package to help cushion the economic blow to at least \u20ac25bn, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Wednesday. It will include funds for topping up wages and support for exporters as well as extra money for the health service.\n\nMinisters are also examining a state guarantee scheme for banks to encourage them to extend forbearance for companies and households that struggle to repay loans. Rome on Tuesday floated the idea of allowing homeowners to delay mortgage payments during the crisis.\n\n\"Given the scale of the disruption that all of this will cause, we suspect that the government will eventually provide fiscal support worth several per cent of GDP,\" said Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics.\n\n\"This wouldn't do much to raise aggregate demand while the quarantine is in place, but it would help to maintain spending on essential items, prevent borrowers from defaulting on their loans and provide a grace period for some tax payments.\"\n\nEconomists now expect an even sharper GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2020 than they were expecting a few weeks ago -- which would push Italy into its fourth recession in just over a decade, after output fell 0.3 per cent in the last three months of last year.\n\n\"We are estimating a recession of 2 to 3 per cent in the first quarter,\" said Mr Rosa. \"If that is protracted we are talking about a recession of at least 2 per cent in 2020 and that is assuming the [containment] measures are effective.\"\n\nWhile there would be some direct impact on the rest of the eurozone through disrupted supply chains and weaker demand, the bigger effect will be on business and consumer sentiment, because of \"the fear of what may be coming their way\", Mr Rosa added.\n\nClaudio Marenzi, president of Italy's Confindustria Moda, the federation which represents Italy's fashion and luxury manufacturing sector, said the question for Italian business was \"about the resources every company is ready to deploy\".\n\n\"The larger ones will have relatively fewer problems to absorb the impact [of the outbreak], even if they are the most exposed, [but] the smaller ones will certainly be the ones to fight for survival,\" he said. \"Every brand and company will stay afloat only if their lungs are big enough.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Tamborini is determined to keep investing despite the uncertainty about the future.\n\n\"The only things to do now are keep our factories active as much as we can, continue to invest and wait for the return of a normal workflow,\" he said.",

their borders in response to the coronavirus threat, as nations risk economic damage and political tensions in their battle to stop the pandemic's spread across Europe.\n\nThe sweeping moves by the three countries escalate an EU member state revolt against Brussels warnings to avoid blanket travel bans and co-ordinate emergency action.\n\nThe bans, with only very limited exemptions, amount to a repudiation of Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, who on Friday urged member states to take a proportionate and co-operative approach.\n\n\"Certain controls may be justified, but general travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the World Health Organization,\" Ms von der Leyen told reporters. \"Moreover, they have a strong social and economic impact, they disrupt people's lives and business across the borders.\"\n\nMette Frederiksen, Denmark's centre-left prime minister, said her country was in \"unknown territory\" and would close its borders to almost all foreigners on Saturday for at least a month. The army will be deployed to patrol the frontier.\n\nThe border controls will apply to land, air and sea traffic from midday on Saturday and will last until April 13, with entry allowed for Danes, food, medicine and components needed for manufacturers.\n\n\"We are in the middle of something none of us has ever tried before,\" Ms Frederiksen said at a press conference on Friday night. \"Right now, I know that the series of actions [we are taking] looks very severe and it will be experienced as severe, but I am convinced that it is worth it.\"\n\nDenmark has by far both the most confirmed novel coronavirus cases and the highest infection rate of the four countries who have sealed their borders, with a tally of more than 780 late on Friday. Neighbouring Germany had more than 3,100 cases, but its population is almost 15 times larger.\n\nSweden's state epidemiologist criticised Denmark's move as \"completely meaningless\". Anders Tegnell added Sweden was highly unlikely to follow suit: \"I have a very hard time seeing how it could help us. There is no research that shows that. On contrary, it would hurt us economically.\"\n\nThe quartet who have closed their frontiers are all members of the 26-country Schengen passport-free travel zone, which is the subject of a US travel ban due to come into force in the early hours of the European morning on Saturday.\n\nPoland's premier Mateusz Morawiecki announced a ban on foreigners entering the state and a suspension of international air and rail connections as his country strove to meet the \"social challenge\" of the virus's proliferation in Europe.\n\nWhile the number of confirmed cases of infection in Poland (68) remained relatively low, he said that the country needed to act fast to prevent a repeat of the tightening of the virus' grip seen elsewhere in Europe.\n\nThe measures -- which include a mandatory two-week quarantine for Poles returning from abroad -- will initially apply for 10 days, but can be extended by a further 20 and then another month if necessary.\n\n\"Our biggest asset will be calmness, calmness which leads to Poland getting through this epidemic in a safer manner than most European countries,\" he said.\n\nAndrej Babis, prime minister of the Czech Republic, said his country would all but close its borders from Monday, barring all foreigners except for those with Czech residence permits. Citizens will also be banned from travelling abroad, except for those in border areas who work in neighbouring countries.\n\nThe republic's neighbour Slovakia on Thursday limited entries to the country to people with residence permits.

April 15 tax filing deadline to help reduce the economic pain from the coronavirus outbreak, as the Trump administration seeks bipartisan support for a stimulus package to bolster the economy.\n\nA senior US official said that pushing back the tax filing deadline was one of several options under consideration, but cautioned that a final decision had not been taken. Postponing the deadline would temporarily ease cash flow and liquidity crunches for individuals and companies at a time of growing uncertainty about the outbreak's broader economic impact.\n\nDonald Trump and his economic team, including Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, held talks with Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to help determine what kind of stimulus measures would generate enough support to pass. The Trump administration is trying to convince lawmakers to support a cut in payroll taxes until the end of the year -- a controversial proposal amid the president's re-election campaign.\n\nDoug Holtz-Eakin, a former top White House budget official who runs the American Action Forum think-tank, said it was doubtful that postponing the tax deadline would have a sustained impact on the economy.\n\n\"I don't really get it. Nobody's tax liability gets changed,\" Mr Holtz-Eakin said. \"I am not a fan of one-offs. This is going to be a sustained headwind and they ought to have a sustained response\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Is this another attempt at instilling confidence with a relatively superficial move or do they genuinely believe it will work?\"\n\nThe proposal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Efforts to formulate measures to ease the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak come as the number of infected people in the US grows rapidly -- and is expected to accelerate in the coming days as production of testing kits is increased and more Americans are tested. According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, 1,050 people in the US have tested positive for coronavirus and 29 have died.\n\nMembers of the White House coronavirus task force have stressed that while the risk to most Americans remains low, the number of cases is expected to increase as more testing is conducted.\n\n\"We will see more cases and things will get worse than they are right now,\" Anthony Fauci, the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the House oversight committee on Wednesday.\n\nThe administration has come under criticism for early problems with distributing sufficient numbers of test kits. Officials have said that 4m kits will have been distributed by the end of this week.\n\nMr Mnuchin met Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House whose support will be critical, on Tuesday after he and Mr Trump had met the Senate Republicans. Afterwards, he said there was a \"lot of interest\" on a bipartisan basis to act.\n\nBut one Republican senator said it was unlikely that a compromise could be reached before lawmakers head home to their districts and states next week -- particularly because of the politics surrounding the issue. While the Democrats want to ease the economic impact, they are more focused on efforts to help the most vulnerable. They are also worried about giving Mr Trump a win that would help him win re-election in November.\n\nDemocrats have already expressed strong opposition to the idea of cutting payroll taxes, and even some Republicans have expressed doubts about the idea, signalling the difficult terrain facing the administration\n\nDemocrats are looking at measures that would provide paid leave to people who are forced to stop working and also unemployment insurance, in addition to measures to ensure that people can get tested for free. According to one Democratic congressional aide, House Democrats were aiming to introduce their own legislation along those lines on Wednesday, and vote on it on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u201320_coronavirus_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2019\u201320 coronavirus outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Holtz-Eakin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Holtz-Eakin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Mnuchin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Mnuchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Payroll tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

the coronavirus crisis. But we need to be clear about what kind of crisis this is. It has the potential to do worldwide economic and human harm. But it is not the result of a flaw in the organisation of the world economy, in the way people, goods and money flow across the globe. It is a\n\nglobal crisis, not a crisis of globalisation.\n\nThe distinction is important, because if politicians and business leaders take the wrong lessons from this crisis, the world will be less prepared for the next.\n\nIt is not surprising that, when Covid-19 still looked like a Chinese rather than a global problem, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said that the virus, regrettable though it was, would \"help accelerate\" the return of jobs to North America. If you see the world economy as a zero-sum game, one country's loss must be another's gain.\n\nFor US president Donald Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, the virus shows \"we cannot necessarily depend on other countries, even close allies, to supply us with needed items\". The best response to any threat, on his view, is to pull up the economic drawbridge.\n\nWhat is more surprising is that the Trump administration is not alone. The virus has revealed the hidden costs and fragility of global supply chains, triggering a \"backlash\" to globalisation.\n\nHappily, the backlash so far is only among politicians and pundits. Yes, some supply chains were shortening long before the virus hit, and this crisis will lead to changes in others. But companies still see the advantages of global trade, consumers still benefit from it, and it still makes the world a safer place.\n\nEconomically, coronavirus sits alongside the Fukushima earthquake and nuclear accident, US-China trade conflicts, and other recent global disruptions. What they have in common is that they demonstrate the dangers of highly concentrated, just-in-time supply chains -- not international ones.\n\nFor too long, companies arranged their operations with only cost in mind, says Per Hong, a supply chain consultant at A T Kearney. Yet crises \"underline the need for companies to design their supply chains around risk competitiveness\" rather than cost alone. The companies he works with are not localising supply, but mitigating risk with regional diversification. \"It is the exact opposite of unwinding the global nature of our supply chains,\" he says.\n\nFukushima demonstrated how much of the global microchip supply chain passed through Japan, with many lower-tier suppliers clustered near the earthquake. But afterwards, as Willy Shih of Harvard Business School points out, big customers saw the risks and shifted some of their sourcing to Taiwan.\n\nWhat they did not do was turn to domestic chip production. That would have been a mistake. Microchips are the perfect example of how local specialisation, spread across the world, creates better products than is possible in any one place. The best chip manufacturing equipment comes from Holland; the strongest chip designs from the US; the best foundries are in Taiwan; and so on.\n\nNor can companies, with profits at stake, indulge in Mr Navarro's fallacy that all threats originate abroad. The UK's domestic coal supplies did not protect it during the 1980s miners' strikes. America's vulnerability to hurricanes and floods is demonstrated repeatedly. The next crisis might start anywhere.\n\nThis is not to deny the value of bringing production closer to demand. In the garment industry, responding quickly to changing tastes and advances in technology make a strong case for \"nearshoring\" production. Levi's is deploying fully automated technology for finishing or \"distressing\" its jeans with lasers. This 90-second process, completed near the final market, used to take a worker in a low-cost country half an hour.\n\nBut companies such as Levi's are nearshoring to give customers what they want, not to reduce the risks of international trade. Nor are they practising good global citizenship by \"bringing jobs home\". What is home? Big, modern companies have customers, employees, and shareholders all over the world.\n\nThat global companies are not creatures of any one country is a point of attack for globalisation's critics. But if we believe that companies have responsibilities to all their stakeholders, do we really want those responsibilities to vary depending on where those stakeholders happen to have been born?\n\nThat would be immoral. It is a virtue, not a vice, of global companies that they build relationships of mutual advantage that do not respect borders. Globalisation binds our fortunes together.\n\nThat these bonds makes us collectively richer is clear, given that the countries which have embraced global trade, along with education and investment, are the most prosperous. The rise of globalisation since 1990 coincides with more than a billion people rising out of extreme poverty. Neither governments nor companies should turn their back on that legacy because of coronavirus.\n\nEven in the current crisis, globalisation can make the world safer. That national economies are fused by the connective tissue of global companies means each country has a selfish interest in helping others. That is a source of stability that anti-globalist rhetoric can only serve to dilute.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Globalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.T._Kearney", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.T.
