The man disembarked in Hong Kong and is no longer on the ship.\n\nTests for the virus were administered to 273 people on the ship who had symptoms such as fever or who had close contact with the infected man. Initial results for 31 people showed 10 of them had the virus, officials said. The 10 were brought to hospitals on shore with help from the Japanese coast guard.\n\nNine are passengers -- two Australian, three Japanese, three from Hong Kong and one from the U.S. -- and one is a Filipino crew member, ship operator Princess Cruises said in a statement.\n\nHealth Minister Katsunobu Kato said Japan \"will take full measures to prevent the infection from spreading.\"\n\nMr. Kato said that in principle everyone on the ship would be required to remain there for 14 days, starting Wednesday. He said he didn't know when the remainder of the test results would be available.\n\nMr. Kato said the ship is planning to travel further away from the coast to dump sewage from tanks that are full. The trip is expected to take more than 10 hours, he said.\n\nThe passengers include people from Taiwan and Hong Kong, and about half are Japanese.\n\nThe cruise ship, which has a dance hall and swimming pool, left Yokohama on Jan. 20. The infected passenger got off on Jan. 25, before it was known he had the coronavirus. The ship then visited Vietnam, Taiwan and Okinawa before returning to Yokohama on Monday night.\n\nA spokesman for Carnival Japan, the local coordinating company for the cruise, said the ship would be resupplied with food and other necessities at Yokohama port on Wednesday. It will also provide free Wi-Fi service and telephone lines.\n\nWrite to Miho Inada at miho.inada@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

He echoed the message in a phone call Friday with President Trump, saying he was confident of victory.\n\nThe Chinese leader also faces anger and frustration over the government's response to the outbreak, emotions that swelled Friday with the death from the virus of Li Wenliang, a young doctor punished for trying to raise an early alarm.\n\nIn the province of Hubei, the center of the outbreak, hospitals are overwhelmed, medical and food supplies depleted, and some 60 million people are held under the largest quarantine in history. The virus first emerged in December in the industrial city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei.\n\nWhile much of the nation's anger is directed at local authorities, blamed for trying to cover up the outbreak, many people also are channeling fury at the censorship and rigid, centralized authority that Mr. Xi has galvanized over the past seven years.\n\n\"This is not just a public health crisis. He seems to be dealing with an internal political crisis,\" said Xiao Qiang, a scholar who studies the Chinese internet at the University of California, Berkeley. China's government information office didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Xi was already under fire from some of China's political and business elite over his handling of the nation's economic slowdown, the U.S. trade war and Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests. He has largely blamed hostile foreign forces, seeking to rally public support.\n\nThe coronavirus epidemic is different. Many Chinese feel directly threatened, propelling a crisis that strikes at the core of Mr. Xi's claims of strong leadership, as well as the authoritarian system he champions as a model to the world.\n\nGovernment censors are working to squelch dissent. A swift end of the outbreak would limit the political fallout. But its continued spread threatens Mr. Xi's plans to rule indefinitely and could leave the Communist Party facing a serious loss of public support.\n\n\"The myth surrounding him has shattered,\" Xu Zhangrun, a professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University said in an interview Friday.\n\nThe term \"people's war\" was first deployed by Chairman Mao Zedong to describe a military strategy to mobilize the entire population. Mr. Xi, who has established himself as China's strongest leader since Mao, has revived much of the imagery and vocabulary from that era.\n\nShare Your Thoughts\n\nWill the coronavirus outbreak threaten the rule of Chinese leader Xi Jinping?Join the conversation below.\n\nSo far, his martial tone appears to have done little to ease the anxiety of many Chinese, some of whom increasingly link the outbreak to his government efforts to roll back the relative freedoms introduced after Mao's death in 1976.\n\nIn recent days, many in Wuhan have asked why Mr. Xi hasn't come to see the crisis for himself. Premier Li Keqiang, the number two in the Party hierarchy, was appointed to head a task force on the outbreak. He visited Wuhan on Jan. 27, touring hospitals in mask and protective gear.\n\nThe next day, state television broadcast footage of Mr. Xi from Beijing saying he was personally directing the Chinese effort, in a meeting with the head of the World Health Organization.\n\nThen, for nearly a week, Mr. Xi didn't appear on state television's evening newscast or the front pages of the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official mouthpiece. In his absence, public confusion and anger grew.\n\nOn China's social media platforms, censors struggled to contain a deluge of comments that appeared to intensify after the death of Dr. Li, who has emerged a folk hero in online calls for freedom of speech.\n\n\"They have manipulated public opinion for decades,\" said one post, later deleted, on the Weibo social media platform. \"They blocked our mouths, but could they blind our hearts? Who are they deceiving?\"\n\nSocial media accounts circulated a picture of Dr. Li, wearing a mask and bearing the words: \"After today, you may not be able to say this name.\"\n\nTracking the Coronavirus\n\nThe coronavirus in two months has sickened thousands in China and reached more than two dozen countries\n\nVIEW In Depth\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the country's internet, went into overdrive to play down Dr. Li's death, ordering news sites to publish only information from official channels, Chinese journalists said. On Friday, it ordered tighter controls to prevent people from using the doctor's death to \"attack the system, the party and the government,\" the journalists said.\n\nXu Zhiyong, a former lecturer at Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications, posted an online essay that said, \"Medicine won't save China: Democracy will save China.\" He is a prominent Chinese civil rights activist, yet he rarely speaks so openly. Mr. Xu didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nMany Chinese people have embraced Mr. Xi's top-down leadership style, saying China needs strong, centralized government to combat corruption and escape a prolonged economic slowdown.\n\nOthers, though, said Dr. Li's death reflected the stifling of dissent under Mr. Xi, and the advance of loyalty and ideology over initiative and open debate. In this view, Mr. Xi's authoritarian rule prompts lower-level officials to suppress bad news, which many people are blaming for the spread of coronavirus.\n\nIn an unusually swift response to public outcry, the National Supervisory Commission, a government anticorruption agency, said Friday it would send a team to Wuhan to investigate Dr. Li's death. Mr. Xi personally signed off on the decision, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nCoronavirus by the Numbers\n\nChina's President Xi is deploying more resources to combat a growing health crisis. The virus has infected 31,213* people and killed 636* in China.\n\nMoney for fighting the virus\n\n5.4 billion yuan\n\n(about $ 800 million)\n\nMedical staff sent to Wuhan\n\n8,310\u2020 from across China\n\nNew medical facilities\n\nTwo hospitals built\n\n13 field hospitals\n\nCities on lock down\n\n13 in Hubei Province\n\nPeople under quarantine\n\nApprox. 60 million\n\n*As of 1 p.m. Friday \u2020As of Feb. 2\n\nSources: Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (infections, deaths); staff and news reports\n\nSome in China suspect that Mr. Xi's absence is part of an effort to claim credit for success against the outbreak or shift blame for failure.\n\n\"From the coronavirus to Hong Kong to the US-China trade war, Xi uses proxies to manage these issues, allowing him to blame others when these problems metastasize,\" said Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\nWuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, tried to point the finger at Beijing last week, saying on state television that he was limited from disclosing the threat posed by the coronavirus. Mr. Xi has since decided to send a trusted political veteran to the city to help lead the virus-control effort.\n\nIn Wuhan, the government is telling local police, community workers, medical staffers and all the others involved in the effort that outstanding performances could earn them promotions. Such performances reflect \"the strategic needs of the 'wartime state' of epidemic control,\" said an article this week in a newspaper owned by the Ministry of Human Resources of Social Security.\n\nSince putting Wuhan and two other cities under quarantine on Jan. 23, Mr. Xi has sent some 1,400 military doctors to Wuhan. He also ordered the armed forces to help distribute medical supplies, and commanded military hospitals and research institutes to assist.\n\nMr. Xi sees the military's involvement, and the overall battlefield approach, as reassuring to nervous citizens, some of whom have been trapped in their apartments under quarantine for two weeks, according to people briefed on his instructions.\n\nThe lockdowns came as a surprise. On Jan. 19, while local authorities in Wuhan held a Lunar New Year's banquet, China's National Health Commission, a cabinet-level agency, sent a team of medical experts to the city, concerned by the spike in infections.\n\nA City Locked Away\n\n11 million people in Wuhan retreat indoors.\n\nGetty Images A City Locked Away\n\n11 million people in Wuhan retreat indoors.\n\nChinaFile/Storyful A City Locked Away\n\n11 million people in Wuhan retreat indoors.\n\nGetty Images A City Locked Away\n\n11 million people in Wuhan retreat indoors.\n\nGetty Images A City Locked Away\n\n11 million people in Wuhan retreat indoors.\n\nChinaFile/Storyful\n\nThe medical group, led by a veteran of the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, concluded that the outbreak was more severe than local authorities had publicly acknowledged. The group, in its recommendation to top Chinese leadership, suggested that authorities lock down the city, if necessary, according to a Wuhan official familiar with the matter.\n\n\"But we all thought that was Plan B,\" the official said. \"No cities had been shut down even during SARS. The economic costs would be too big.\" The decision to quarantine Wuhan, ordered by Mr. Xi, was unexpected, he said.\n\nMany foreign health experts said such broad quarantines are rarely effective and instead cause unnecessary suffering among those not infected.\n\nAnger, frustration and fear have spread among many of the Chinese trapped in quarantined cities, drawing rare outbursts of resentment.\n\nDuring Mr. Li's visit, he asked a gathered crowd if they were getting used to the isolation, according to a video that went viral on China's social media.\n\n\"Don't we have to get used to it?\" one person said in an unusually defiant tone toward China's second-highest leader.\n\nSince then, Beijing has instructed local Communist Party members to reassure people and stop by the homes of people infected. A near-paralysis of the city transportation has made the order difficult to follow.\n\n\"Of course as a party member, I would like to step forward, but the question is: How?\" a local tax official said.\n\nRelated\n\nAmerican Citizen Diagnosed With Coronavirus Dies in China Africa Girds for Tough Fight Against Virus China's Factories Struggle to Resume Operations After Virus Shutdown What We Know About the Coronavirus\n\nChinese bureaucrats are racing to build what they call a \"wartime mechanism,\" such measures as keeping a lid on the price of medical supplies and other essential tools in the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nOn the war's front lines, medical workers in Wuhan say they are desperately short of medical supplies. A doctor at a midsize hospital said the facility hadn't received any medical supplies from the government. The hospital was relying entirely on donations.\n\nThe doctor was critical of the orders that people isolate themselves at home. \"Even at a large hospital like ours, we still lack supplies, \" he said. \"How can ordinary people quarantine themselves at home?\"\n\nWrite to Jeremy Page at jeremy.page@wsj.com and Lingling Wei at lingling.wei@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

hong-ji/Reuters\n\nWorried about air travel amid the global health crisis? Wash your hands.\n\nHealth experts say the best protections you can undertake are the same prescribed for avoiding flu, common cold and other viruses: washing hands frequently and using antiviral sanitizers. On airplanes, open the air vents and aim them at your face to breathe filtered air.\n\nThough much of the focus of the novel coronavirus outside of China has been on travelers, riding on airplanes doesn't expose you to any greater risk than other situations where you are in close contact with possibly sick people: subways, movie theaters, lines at the grocery store.\n\nBut flying does put you in close contact with people, and studies have shown that travelers have a higher risk for getting sick. One study pegged the increased risk of catching the common cold at 20% if you're on a plane.\n\nResearch in 2009 tracing H1N1 flu transmission on a flight found that 2% of passengers had the disease during the flight and 5% came down with the disease within a week after landing. Coach passengers were at a 3.6% increased risk of contracting H1N1 if they sat within two rows of someone who had symptoms in-flight. That increased risk for post-flight disease doubled to 7.7% for passengers seated within a two-seat hot zone in any direction.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nAnother study modeling risk between economy class and first class concluded with the obvious: the chances of exposure are lessened if there are fewer people around you. If a flight is full, there would be less chance of getting infected in first class compared with coach. But the odds could be flipped if first class is full and economy class isn't.\n\nHealth organizations haven't issued warnings about air travel itself, other than to China. Airlines report no significant cancellations in domestic travel. Companies are still asking employees to travel for work -- except to China.\n\nThe concern about air travel is that airplanes do transport the virus by moving infected people around the globe. Thus the flight bans to China and screening of travelers arriving in the U.S. who have been in China.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people need not take special precautions. (You'll find excellent CDC travel advice here.)\n\n\"We do not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general American public,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Friday during a telephone news conference. \"This virus is not spreading in your communities.\"\n\nCoronavirus is a respiratory virus that is thought to be transmitted through tiny droplets excreted by coughing and sneezing. Research on other viruses has shown that on an airplane, you are at risk if you are within two or three rows of an infected person -- basically the distance a droplet might travel.\n\nAir on airplanes is generally isolated to specific zones -- the air in your zone gets sucked in and recirculated in the same zone. In addition, most aircraft flying today pass recirculated air through a series of filters 20 to 30 times an hour. The filters used, called High-Efficiency Particulate Air, or HEPA, filters, are hospital-operating-room grade and capable of removing 99.9% of particulate such as bacteria, fungi, larger viruses and virus clumps, according to the CDC.\n\n\"The cabin air environment is not conducive to the spread of most infectious diseases,\" the CDC says in a briefing on air travel.\n\nThe World Health Organization says its general recommendations for travelers apply to coronavirus:\n\n* Frequently clean your hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\n\n* When coughing and sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue, throw that tissue away immediately and wash hands.\n\n* Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever and cough.\n\n* If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health-care provider.\n\nIf you're traveling back to the U.S. from abroad, you may want to get to the airport even earlier than normal. As of Sunday, the Trump administration required airlines to check if passengers have been to mainland China in the past 14 days. Some of that may get automated. United, for example, says it is building questions into the check-in flow to take the burden off agents at the airport.\n\nPeople who have been to mainland China within the previous two weeks must arrive in the U.S. at one of 11 large airports set up to inspect them and, if necessary, quarantine them after they land. If that's not their arrival point, they'll get rebooked at no charge. Those airports -- New York Kennedy, Chicago O'Hare, San Francisco, Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Washington Dulles, Newark, N.J., Dallas-Fort Worth and Detroit -- represent most international arrivals from Asia, so rebooking is expected to be minimal.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security says U.S. citizens who have been in Hubei province within 14 days of their return will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine. U.S. citizens who have been in other areas of mainland China within 14 days of their return will undergo health screening at the airport and be asked to self-quarantine for two weeks. Foreign nationals who have traveled in China within 14 days of their arrival will be denied entry unless they are immediate family of U.S. citizens, permanent residents or flight crew.\n\nA few other Middle Seat tips:\n\n* Airline cleaning of airplanes is scant, so you may want to bring your own disinfecting wipes for public surfaces like tray tables and arm rests.\n\n* If you do want to wear a face mask, you have to get something better than a regular paper surgical mask. Those masks, which are designed to stop your germs from getting out and infecting others, won't stop the coronavirus from getting in, doctors say. You need a mask called an N95 respirator, which is thicker than a standard mask. Those masks are challenging to put on and wear for long periods.\n\n* If someone near you is sneezing and coughing, ask the person to cover his or her mouth, and then ask a flight attendant to move you to an empty seat. Even a middle seat.\n\nWrite to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.com\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Hospital built in 10 days ready to admit its first coronavirus patients\n\nRead More", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_mccartney@wsj.com", "name": "Scott McCartney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sneeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air travel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H1N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Common cold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hand washing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filtration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filtration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transmission (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symptom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Dulles_International_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Dulles International Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Hare_International_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O'Hare International Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

By Michael Auslin Michael Auslin The Wall Street Journal BiographyMichael Auslin Feb. 7, 2020 6:44 pm ET\n\nIn October 1911, a virus erupted in Wuhan, China. Revolutionaries opposed to foreign control of China's railways stormed a military garrison, easily defeating imperial forces and revealing the weakness of the ruling Qing dynasty. Known as the Wuchang Uprising, the political virus quickly spread. Three months later the Chinese Revolution toppled the Manchu rulers and ushered in the Republic of China. Today, Wuhan is at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, and the effect on the People's Republic of China may prove to be just as revolutionary.\n\nThe Qing had ruled China for four centuries when this earlier Wuhan virus exploded. Though reeling from decades of civil war, defeat at the hands of Japan, and colonialism, the Qing still seemed too mighty to fall. And yet, within weeks, the last emperor, the child Pu Yi, had abdicated. At present, no one expects the coronavirus to bring down the government in Beijing, but its spread is exposing weaknesses in the Communist Party's hold on power. It may also fundamentally change China's global image.\n\nThe coronavirus has spread with startling speed. Beijing is desperately trying to quarantine major cities, including Wuhan. More people already have died on the mainland from the virus than from the 2003 SARS epidemic. Grumbling on social media about the official response to the outbreak has made headlines around the world. The death of Dr. Li Wenliang, who tried to warn about the outbreak but was threatened by authorities, has outraged many, confirming their belief that the party state is more interested in maintaining social control than in the health of its citizens.\n\nAll this threatens Chinese leader Xi Jinping. His rule since 2012 has focused on the creation of a cult of competence. His aggressive economic and foreign policies have challenged America's global leadership, while Beijing's relentless influence campaigns have sought to eliminate negative images of the country around the world.\n\nMr. Xi warns that China's very social stability is at risk -- a candid recognition that the situation in Wuhan could cause another revolution. He has made defeating the contagion his top priority. After weeks of ignoring offers of help from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, he finally relented.\n\nHe also has ordered the lockdown of 50 million people. These are clear signs that Mr. Xi considers the crisis an existential threat. Yet the government is also increasing surveillance over China's citizens for not wearing masks or congregating in private houses, and is policing the internet for antigovernment posts. Moreover, Mr. Xi has been mysteriously absent from the media of late, leaving Premier Li Keqiang publicly holding the bag.\n\nIn contrast with the post-1978 era of \"reform and opening up\" under Deng Xiaoping, Mr. Xi's China was becoming more repressive, secretive and xenophobic even before the epidemic. Despite its wealth, China is little trusted internationally. Many countries no longer see China's rise as a problem to be managed but as the leading threat to regional and global order.\n\nScience will ultimately defeat the coronavirus. The epidemic is most significant for the ways it is changing the world's thinking about China. Domestically, it has resulted in anger at the authorities' lack of preparedness and openness as well as disdain for the CCP's governing ability. Abroad, it has raised uncertainty about the safety of living, studying, or doing business in China. Depending on the ultimate scope of the outbreak, it may take years for China's image to recover.\n\nMr. Xi's inflated reputation was due for a reality check, as the truth about China's economy and society became more evident. The tragedy of the coronavirus is this: It may be the shock necessary for a more-measured assessment of China's strengths and weaknesses. If unchecked, however, it may have more-dire effects. Don't rule out a second Wuhan revolution.\n\nMr. Auslin is a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Marshals Its Surveillance Powers Against Coronavirus", "body": "Officials use big data to track the movements of infected individuals By Liza Lin Liza Lin The Wall Street Journal BiographyLiza Lin @liz_in_shanghai liza.lin@wsj.com Updated Feb. 4, 2020 3:50 pm ET\n\nIn January, a person infected with the dangerous new Wuhan coronavirus used public transportation to crisscross the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, potentially exposing those along the way to the highly contagious pathogen.\n\nUsing the country's pervasive digital-surveillance apparatus, authorities were able to track -- down to the minute -- the sick person's exact journey through the city's subway system.\n\nTracking a Carrier\n\nA person infected with the novel coronavirus travelled around the Chinese city of Nanjing and visited two hospitals before being placed under quarantine.\n\nA tale of two days\n\n5\n\n4 miles\n\n6\n\n7\n\n4 km\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\nChenghecun\n\n4\n\n5\n\nYangtze

Gets off at Xian Men station (3) at 5:15 p.m. and walks to Nanjing General Hospital's (4) outpatient building.\n\nAt 6:18 p.m. enters Xian Men station (3)\n\nand takes line 2 back to Daxinggong (2) and changes to line 3 to Luizhou East subway station (5).\n\nAfter 6:45 p.m., takes the No. 692 bus near\n\nJiangshan Road and Mingjiang Road (6) and gets off at Daqiao North (7).\n\nJan. 19\n\n1:36 p.m: Gets on the No. 637 bus at Puzhu\n\nNorth Road, Da Qiao North road (1) gets off outside Pukou Hospital (2).\n\n2:33 p.m.: Takes the No. 692 bus near the\n\nhospital and gets off at Puzhu North Road,\n\nLehua Road (3).\n\n2.43 p.m.: Boards the No. 558 bus, towards\n\nChenghecun, gets off at Nanjing's No. 2 Hospital (4). Sees doctor and is brought to Nanjing Municipal Center for Public Health Emergency (5) and placed under quarantine.\n\nSources: Google Earth; Nanjing government\n\nOfficials then published those and other details of the person's movements on social media and warned residents to get themselves checked if they had been in the vicinity at the time.\n\n\"In this day and age, you can trace everyone's movements with big data,\" Li Lanjuan, an adviser to the National Health Commission, said in an interview with state television.\n\nChina's government has launched an unprecedented effort to track the fast-spreading virus, which has infected more than 20,000 people and killed at least 425 around the world.\n\nMuch of the work is being done by armies of neighborhood monitors and managers of residential complexes, tasked with checking on people believed to have recently traveled to Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, and reporting their findings to authorities.\n\nBut the human virus trackers have help. Authorities are sifting through information from phone companies, railroads and airlines as they tackle the country's biggest public-health crisis since an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, almost two decades ago.\n\nChina has built a formidable digital-surveillance system in recent years, linking facial recognition, security cameras and social-media monitoring with regular human surveillance. The aim is to keep tabs on its 1.4 billion citizens, chiefly to identify and prevent threats to social order and Communist Party control.\n\nThe country's state-run media has celebrated the application of the authorities' big-data tracking abilities in the campaign to control the disease outbreak, touting it as an example of the social benefits of technology.\n\nShizhu county in Chongqing, in southwestern China, said it used unspecified data to track more than 5,500 people arriving for the Lunar New Year holiday from Hubei province. Roughly half were placed under home quarantine, the Communist Party-run Chongqing Daily newspaper reported.\n\nIn Zhejiang province, not far from Nanjing, authorities dealing with one patient who denied having contact with anyone in Wuhan were able to use data analysis to show he had interacted with three others from the city, China Central Television reported last week.\n\nChinese officials not only have access to more data than most other governments, but they can also tap it more quickly thanks to close relationships with the mostly state-run companies that oversee the country's transportation and telecommunications networks.\n\nThat has allowed China to partially automate the process of tracking the movements of infected individuals -- a process known as contact tracing -- which most countries still do using face-to-face interviews.\n\nIn China, \"there is a much greater capacity to access and analyze big data, so the potential scale of contact tracing that could be undertaken is much larger,\" said Nic Geard, an engineering professor who studies data modeling of diseases at the University of Melbourne.\n\nMr. Geard, however, cautioned about risks to individual privacy. Even if data is redacted, \"there can be enough personally identifying information such that you can reconstruct the person's identity,\" he said.\n\nAn online leak of personal information, including home addresses, belonging to hundreds of people who had traveled home from Wuhan illustrates the dangers. Several in the group, many of them university students, reported being bombarded with harassing phone calls and messages on social media.\n\nIn a notice published last week, China's Ministry of Transport warned taxi and ride-hailing companies to take greater care in protecting user privacy when transferring data to the National Health Commission.\n\nSome experts argue that privacy matters less in an emergency. \"In the event of a public-safety threat, it is OK to sacrifice some privacy for the benefit of society,\" said Zhu Wei, associate professor at China University of Political Science and Law and adviser to the government on legal issues in cyberspace.\n\nChinese citizens are accustomed to handing over personally identifying information to the government and organizations like the country's state-run railway.\n\nHuang Xin, an executive with China State Railway Group Co., said at a press conference in Beijing last week that it had set up a task force to help response teams track passenger traffic and identify people who have shared cars with virus patients. The company had provided such data more than 200 times in the 30 days since the start of the outbreak, he said.\n\nRelated\n\nCoronavirus Outbreak a Major Test of China's System, Says Xi Jinping Officials Err on Side of Caution Tracking the Coronavirus The Economic Impact of Coronavirus, by the Numbers Coronavirus Closes China to the World, Straining Global Economy Coronavirus Kills Its First Victim Outside China as Toll Grows\n\nTransportation authorities said last week that, in addition to entering national ID numbers, all railway passengers now also need to provide mobile-phone numbers to purchase tickets.\n\nChina's tech giants have also sought to adopt big data to fight the outbreak. Chinese search-engine and mapping provider Baidu Inc. produced an online map that allows users to track the final destination of outbound car trips from Wuhan in the days leading to the city's shutdown. Sogou, another Beijing-based search engine, runs an app allowing travelers to search retrospectively if they were on the same flights or trains as infected victims.\n\nSmaller startups introduced maps for Chinese netizens to track the number of virus infections in a neighborhood in real time.\n\nChina's three big state-run telecom operators contribute to the tracking by using network signals to monitor the location of mobile phones, said Huang Huang, a data scientist at Peking University's School of Government. Mobile-phone numbers in China are tied to national ID numbers, meaning it is easy for carriers to identify the owner of almost any device, Mr. Huang said.\n\nOne of those carriers, China Unicom, created a big-data team of more than 100 people to help the government's outbreak response team track population movements, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nNone of the three telecom carriers responded to requests for comment. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which regulates data-sharing, also didn't respond to a request for comment. China has been on an extended Lunar New Year holiday break because of the coronavirus.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nShould governments use surveillance technology to track contagious disease outbreaks? How do you think it would work in the U.S.? Join the conversation below.\n\nWest Africa has tried to use information from telecom carriers to fight the spread of Ebola in the past, but those efforts were hindered by difficulty identifying the owners of mobile-phone numbers, patchy mobile network coverage and pushback from privacy advocates, said Susan Erikson, a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nFew of those problems come into play in China, where roughly 850 million mobile internet users are served by 4G networks that cover almost the entire country. Concern over data privacy, though growing in major cities, is small to nonexistent in most places.\n\nMs. Erikson, who spent time in Sierra Leone during the Ebola crisis, said the idea of using big data often sounds more impressive than it is.\n\n\"In reality, there is too little return on the massive investment required to translate telecom info into public-health action,\" she added. \"The opportunity costs in an emergency are huge. Paying attention to low-return activity during a crisis means not paying attention to other more urgent public-health needs.\"\n\n-- Yang Jie contributed to this article.\n\nThe 10-Point In Your Inbox\n\nGet a daily, guided tour of the best scoops and stories in The Wall Street Journal.

Police arrested him shortly after he warned classmates of the new virus, accusing him of spreading rumors and forcing him to write a statement admitting to \"illegal behavior.\"\n\nChina's National Supervisory Commission, the country's top anticorruption body, said Friday that it would send a special team to Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, to investigate the circumstances around Dr. Li's death.\n\nThe Wuhan municipal government, meanwhile, published a notice on its website Friday to pay tribute to Dr. Li, expressing profound sorrow and conveying condolences to his family. The National Health Commission and the health commissions of Wuhan and Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, issued similar statements.\n\nChinese online commenters have been calling on the Wuhan government to apologize to Dr. Li for having reprimanded him for sending warnings about the virus.\n\nDr. Li himself contracted the virus, and as news of his declining health spread online Thursday evening, a hashtag calling on the Wuhan government to apologize to him spread quickly on China's Twitter -like Weibo service. Public anger grew further after the hashtag appeared to be censored.\n\nThe investigation and apologies came as the death toll from the virus rose to more than 600 and the number of infected cases topped 30,000 in mainland China by the end of Thursday, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nSeparately, Chinese President Xi Jinping told President Trump in a phone call Friday morning Beijing time that he had confidence the country would win what he called a \"people's war\" against the deadly coronavirus, according to readouts from the White House and Chinese state media reports.\n\nThe Latest on the Coronavirus\n\nThe death toll in mainland China has surpassed 600, with more than 30,000 confirmed cases Xi Jinping told President Trump he has confidence China will win \"the people's war\" against the virus At least four countries are monitoring hundreds of people who attended a business meeting in Singapore after four people tested positive\n\nDuring the conversation, the first known communication between the two leaders since the World Health Organization last week declared the virus outbreak a global public-health emergency, Mr. Trump expressed confidence in China's strength and resilience in confronting the outbreak, the White House said.\n\nMr. Xi told Mr. Trump that the Chinese government and people were mobilized and fighting hard against the outbreak, while emphasizing his \"full confidence\" that China had the capability to defeat the epidemic -- a possible suggestion that Beijing doesn't anticipate a need to accept large amounts of overseas aid.\n\n-- Xiao Xiao, Lekai Liu and Alex Leary contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The jobs growth trend is a testament to the U.S. economy's resilience, though it needs a trade-war asterisk.\n\nEmployment rose by 225,000 compared to a monthly average gain of 175,000 last year and 211,000 in the past three months. Average hourly wages for all private workers ticked up 3.1% year-over-year and 3.3% for production-level workers, which continues the trend that income gains are rising more for average workers than for their bosses.\n\nThe January report included benchmark revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which makes comparisons more difficult for the labor supply and jobless rate that popped up a tick to 3.6%. But the report showed that more Americans are still moving back into the labor force from the sidelines as labor participation rose 0.2 percentage points to 63.4% and the employment-to-population ratio for 25- to 54-year-olds rose to 80.6% -- the highest since June 2001.\n\nThe asterisk is manufacturing, which lost 12,000 jobs. Most were in autos, but Boeing's suspension of its 737 MAX jet has hurt its suppliers.\n\nAn electronics manufacturer captured the mood in this week's Institute for Supply Management report: \"Business has picked up considerably. Many of our suppliers are working at or above full capacity. Tariffs are still a concern and are believed to be a factor in short supply and higher prices of electronic parts. Our profit margin has been somewhat negatively affected by high tariffs, particularly on electronic parts from China.\"\n\nThis is the fallout from President Trump's tariffs that bruised U.S. manufacturers last year. Manufacturers shed 8,200 jobs in Indiana, 5,700 in Pennsylvania, 5,300 in Michigan and 4,100 in Wisconsin. The China trade truce will help but now comes the coronavirus.\n\nAnother point: A tighter labor supply will sooner or later be a brake on growth if it isn't already as the workforce ages.

Wall Street Journal BiographyAusten Hufford @austenhufford austen.hufford@wsj.com Melanie Evans Melanie Evans The Wall Street Journal BiographyMelanie Evans @_melaevans melanie.evans@wsj.com Feb. 6, 2020 5:30 am ET\n\nChinese officials are buying up medical masks in the virus-wracked country from factories that typically supply hospitals around the world, forcing manufacturers to boost output globally and hospitals to ration supplies.\n\nMasks are essential protective gear for medical workers treating patients potentially infected with the newly identified coronavirus, which has spread across China and beyond. China is one of the world's top producers of medical masks and other gear. Now officials there are directing much of that supply to the front lines of the outbreak, leaving customers in the U.S. and other countries to look elsewhere for masks as global supplies tighten.\n\nMedicom Group, a Montreal-based mask maker, said it received a letter from officials in Shanghai ordering it to sell output from its factory in the city to the local government.\n\n\"They've got to take care of their people as well,\" said Medicom Chief Executive Ronald Reuben. \"It's disruptive, but what can you do?\"\n\nMedicom is trying to ramp up production in Shanghai but its workforce has been winnowed by travel restrictions that kept many employees from returning to the plant after the Lunar New Year. \"They are working around the clock,\" he said.\n\nOfficials in India and Taiwan have banned exports of medical masks. Medicom, meanwhile, is raising output at factories in France and Augusta, Ga., as demand has swelled for masks produced in other countries. The French plant, which typically makes around 170 million masks a year, has received orders for 500 million.\n\n3M Co. MMM 3.24% said the Shanghai municipal government is requiring additional \"supervision and control\" of some of its facilities in China as a result of the outbreak. The local government has taken responsibility for orders and delivery of 3M respirators in Shanghai, company spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich said. She added that respirators 3M makes in China typically are sold there.\n\nThe local government in Dongguan is buying all the masks from a factory owned by Makrite Industries Inc. in the southern Chinese manufacturing hub, the company said. Some of those masks are typically shipped to customers including retailer Home Depot Inc. and Cardinal Health Inc., a medical-device manufacturer and distributor.\n\n\"We need to support the government first until it gets better,\" Makrite CEO Bob Wen said. He said officials were helping Makrite fill travel-related staffing gaps, which have crimped output at the factory, where typical volume of 160,000 masks a day has fallen to 40,000 a day since the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nA letter dated Feb. 3 from China's State Council to one manufacturer said the government would buy its entire supply of surgical masks and protective clothing, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The letter also said the government would set up a national reserve that would absorb any surplus caused by the emergency.\n\nAn official whose phone number was listed in the letter referred a request for comment to a government information department, which didn't respond. Municipal officials in Shanghai and Dongguan didn't reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe coronavirus that first appeared late last year in Wuhan, in central China, has infected more than 28,000 people and killed some 560. Most cases have appeared in mainland China, but people have also fallen sick in more than a dozen other countries, including the U.S. The State Department has told U.S. citizens to avoid travel to China, and major airlines have suspended flights to and from the country.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nHave you noticed an increase in people using medical masks in your city? Have you started using one? Why? Join the conversation below.\n\nDirect Relief, a nonprofit based in Santa Barbara, Calif., that provides medical supplies during disasters, is sending air shipments of more than 300,000 masks to hospitals in China.\n\nThe medical-grade masks most in demand are known as N95 respirators because they block at least 95% of very small particles and are used in hospital and industrial settings. They are more advanced than the pleated masks many people wear to prevent the spread of disease.\n\nUsed in evaluating illnesses including potential cases of measles and tuberculosis, the masks are typically discarded after one wear, and staff treating a typical high-risk patient can go through 50 a day, physicians said.\n\nSome customers who buy masks from Chinese factories said their supplies are running short. Industrial supply company Seattle Glove Inc. said it sold its typical monthly volume of about 200,000 face masks in four days about a week ago.\n\n\"I have nothing, and I don't have anything coming,\" said Doug Tran, the company's vice president.\n\nW.W. Grainger Inc. an industrial distributor that buys masks from China and elsewhere, said it is out of inventory and that orders are piling up.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration said no manufacturer of products it regulates has yet reported disruptions suggesting shortages of critical medical products. Reporting by mask manufacturers is voluntary. The FDA said it would respond to potential disruptions by expediting review of alternative supplies.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services maintains a strategic stockpile of medical equipment including face masks and other protective gear.\n\nThe relatively small number of companies that make masks in the U.S. are increasing production. Louis M. Gerson Co. is expanding production at its factory in Middleboro, Mass., to seven days a week, from four. \"We probably have 12 months of orders that our existing customers would like shipped within a week,\" CEO Ronald Gerson said.\n\nRead more\n\nOutbreak Prompts Patients to Scramble for Remedies Coronavirus Cruise Passengers Face Infection Worries, Blown Travel Plans and Boredom United, American Airlines Suspend Hong Kong Service as Coronavirus Saps Demand) Rapid Spread of Coronavirus Tests Apple's China Dependency\n\nMany suppliers have capped orders for masks at just above typical levels, said executives with Premier Inc. and Vizient Inc., which negotiate contracts for medical products on behalf of hospitals. Doing so can help distribute goods during a shortage or prevent hoarding by customers who fear a shortage, the executives said.\n\nSome hospitals are searching for new suppliers and looking for ways to deplete stockpiles more slowly, such as by limiting work that requires masks to select employees.\n\nNew York hospital system Northwell Health is working out how to prioritize masks at high-risk locations among its 800 clinics, and it is asking staff to reuse masks when possible, under guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Mark Jarrett, Northwell's deputy chief medical officer and chief quality officer, said.\n\nKaiser Permanente, the hospital and health insurance system based in Oakland, Calif., will limit the number of staff outfitted with masks to select groups that will respond in the event of a local outbreak, said Dr. David Witt, Kaiser's Northern California hospital epidemiologist. That means fewer masks wasted in fittings, he said.\n\nDr. Witt said Kaiser started preparing for shortages soon after the outbreak became public. \"It's been one long day since then,\" he said. \"We are seeing signs the shortage is starting.\"\n\n-- Sharon Terlep in New York, Qianwei Zhang in Beijing and Zhao Yueling in Shanghai contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com and Melanie Evans at Melanie.Evans@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

10:28 pm ET\n\nHere is President Trump's State of the Union address as prepared for delivery and released by the White House.\n\nMadam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow citizens:\n\nThree years ago, we launched the great American comeback. Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again! America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright.\n\nThe years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.\n\nIn just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!\n\nI am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world -- and it is not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country, and to the Members of Congress before me: The State of our Union is stronger than ever before!\n\nThe vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society -- one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success, and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise.\n\nFrom the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the United States economy -- slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed.\n\nSince my election, we have created 7 million new jobs -- 5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.\n\nIncredibly, the average unemployment rate under my Administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. If we had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witness to America's great economic success.\n\nThe unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans have reached the lowest levels in history. African-American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.\n\nAfrican-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.\n\nThe unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years -- and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.\n\nThe veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low.\n\nThe unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low.\n\nWorkers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in United States history.\n\nA record number of young Americans are now employed.\n\nUnder the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my Administration, 7 million Americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.\n\nIn 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just 3 years of my Administration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined the workforce.\n\nSince my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent -- 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast -- and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom.\n\nReal median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded!\n\nSince my election, United States stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our Nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible -- this, as other countries are not doing well. Consumer confidence has reached amazing new heights.\n\nAll of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and even 100 percent.\n\nJobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously-neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that have not seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It is all working!\n\nOpportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army Veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family -- he was homeless. But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Tony: Keep up the great work.\n\nOur roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark Criminal Justice Reform into law. Everybody said that Criminal Justice Reform could not be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done.\n\nThanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many elements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago.\n\nLikewise, we are restoring our Nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were that this could never be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my Administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built. We have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs. Companies are not leaving; they are coming back. Everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is, indeed, where the action is.\n\nOne of the single biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA's adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA -- only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law.\n\nThe USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher degree, but also to a much greater level of fairness and reciprocity. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions.\n\nI also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed that but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying: Enough. Now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is what we are doing.\n\nAs we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That is why my Administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3. Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.\n\nTo safeguard American Liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States Military. We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment -- all made in the United States of America. We are also finally getting our allies to help pay their fair share. I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled.\n\nAnd just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a new branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force.\n\nIn the gallery tonight, we have one of the Space Force's youngest potential recruits: 13-year-old Iain Lanphier, an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then, he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, \"most people look up at space, I want to look down on the world.\"\n\nSitting beside Iain tonight is his great hero. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen -- the first black fighter pilots -- and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather. After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back to a country still struggling for Civil Rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee: Our Nation salutes you.\n\nFrom the pilgrims to our Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future.\n\nMembers of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first!\n\nThe next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah's mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children.\n\nJaniyah and Stephanie are in the gallery this evening. But there is more to their story. Janiyah, I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it is going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice!\n\nNow, I call on the Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act -- because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.\n\nEvery young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the \"Be Best\" initiative -- to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation, online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children.\n\nMy Administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans.\n\nMy Budget also contains an exciting vision for our Nation's high schools. Tonight, I ask the Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America.\n\nTo expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\nA good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth. Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive. I have also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions -- that is a guarantee. And we will always protect your Medicare and your Social Security.\n\nThe American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an Executive Order requiring price transparency. Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care.\n\nBut as we work to improve Americans' healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!\n\nOver 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. This is what is happening in California and other States -- their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government healthcare for illegal aliens!\n\nThis will be a tremendous boon to our already very-strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. We have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year.\n\nMy Administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down.\n\nAnd working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay.\n\nWith unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic -- drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent -- and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.\n\nProtecting Americans' health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the Coronavirus outbreak in China. My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.\n\nWe have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer's, and those struggling with mental health challenges. And because the Congress funded my request, we are pursuing new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of the decade.\n\nAlmost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, someone beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh: Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to please stand and present you with the honor. Rush, Kathryn, congratulations!\n\nAs we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke's hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was born a fighter. Through the skill of her doctors -- and the prayers of her parents -- little Ellie kept on winning the battle for life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery. Ellie and Robin: We are so glad you are here.\n\nEllie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. Thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I am asking the Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neo-natal research for America's youngest patients. That is also why I am calling upon the Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.\n\nWhether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!\n\nAs we support America's moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. Now, I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the Nation.\n\nForty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit. I have also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 States to serve more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether. And I sent the Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality childcare and urge you to act immediately.\n\nTo protect the environment, days ago, I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together Government and the private sector to plant new trees in America and around the world.\n\nWe must also rebuild America's infrastructure. I ask you to pass Senator Barrasso's highway bill -- to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels across our land.\n\nI am also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed internet, including rural America.\n\nA better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our Nation's heroic ICE officers.\n\nLast year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.\n\nTragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. In Sanctuary Cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.\n\nJust 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the Sanctuary City of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York's sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE's detainer request, his victim would be alive today.\n\nThe State of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole State to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants -- with catastrophic results.\n\nHere is just one tragic example. In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. But as required by California's Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him.\n\nDays later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims of his bloody rampage was a 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers who loved him more than anything. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody, our hearts weep for your loss -- and we will not rest until you have justice.\n\nSenator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue Sanctuary Cities and States when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly policies. I ask the Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans -- not criminal aliens!\n\nIn the last 3 years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers -- and I have signed 9 pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and around the globe.\n\nMy Administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States.\n\nBefore I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My Administration has ended Catch-and-Release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed. We entered into historic cooperation agreements with the Governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May -- dropping 8 straight months in a row. And as the wall goes up, drug seizures rise, and border crossings go down.\n\nLast year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol -- and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz: Please stand -- a grateful Nation thanks you and all the heroes of Border Patrol.\n\nTo build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.\n\nWith every action, my Administration is restoring the rule of law and re-asserting the culture of American freedom. Working with Senate Majority Leader McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new Federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nMy Administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the Constitutional right to pray in public schools. In America, we do not punish prayer. We do not tear down crosses. We do not ban symbols of faith. We do not muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith. We cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God!\n\nJust as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another Constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am President I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n\nIn reaffirming our heritage as a free Nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking the Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts -- using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.\n\nMy Administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism. Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the change to realize a better future.\n\nThree years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer Al\u2011Baghdadi -- is dead!\n\nWe are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. Kayla once wrote, \"Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love; I find God in suffering. I've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.\" In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of Al-Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, Al-Baghdadi murdered young Kayla. She was just 26 years old.\n\nOn the night that United States Special Forces Operators ended Al\u2011Baghdadi's miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team, that so perfectly carried out the operation, had given their mission a name -- \"Task Force 8-14.\" It was a reference to a special day: August 14th -- Kayla's birthday. Carl and Marsha, America's warriors never forgot Kayla -- and neither will we.\n\nEvery day, America's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depths of love that dwells in the human heart.\n\nOne of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his 1-year-old son, Gage: \"I will be with you again,\" he wrote to Gage. \"I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. I love you son, take care of your mother. I am always with you. Dad.\" On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now 13 years old. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever.\n\nThe terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life. Soleimani was the Iranian Regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault on United States Forces in Iraq, and was actively planning new attacks. That is why, last month, at my direction, the United States Military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.\n\nOur message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life!\n\nIn recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very poorly. We can help them make it very good in a short period of time, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let's see which road they choose. It is totally up to them.\n\nAs we defend American lives, we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency. These are warfighters, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home!\n\nWar places a heavy burden on our Nation's extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her 2 children -- 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan. Amy works full time, and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the Middle East. Amy's kids have not seen their father's face in many months. Amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and peace -- we thank you.\n\nAs the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is the place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great Generals, including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo.\n\nThe American Nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out canals, raised up the skyscrapers -- and, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional Republic ever to exist in all of human history. And we are making it greater than ever before!\n\nThis is our glorious and magnificent inheritance.\n\nWe are Americans. We are the pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the new world, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God.\n\nAmerica is the place where anything can happen! America is the place where anyone can rise. And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true!\n\nThis Nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American Age, the American Epic, the American Adventure, has only just begun!\n\nOur spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!\n\nThank you. God Bless You. God Bless America.\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Wall Street Journal BiographyStu Woo @stuwoo stuwoo Stu.Woo@wsj.com Updated Feb. 7, 2020 2:33 pm ET\n\nWUHAN, China -- Patients packed the waiting room at Wuhan's Tongji Hospital on Friday, intravenous drips in their arms. Medical staff wheeled patients slowly through the crowd. In the hallways, the sick lay curled up on cots, hooked to oxygen tanks.\n\nDoctors and nurses in full-body protective suits, gloves, goggles and masks waded through, changing IVs and trying to determine who was in most urgent need of medical attention.\n\nAs China fights to contain the highly contagious new virus -- which so far has infected more than 30,000 people and killed more than 600, according to official government figures -- the country's health-care system is being pushed to the brink.\n\nTongji and other medical centers in this central Chinese city on the front lines of the battle are overwhelmed, short of supplies and facing an ever-growing number of people desperate for treatment.\n\nIn the waiting room on Friday, Wang Hongyan, 66 years old, cried out for a nurse to unhook her husband from an empty IV bag, but the nurse was busy attending to another patient. He had tested negative for the virus earlier in the week, but she brought him back to the hospital because he was feverish, coughing and had an infected lung. Ms. Wang herself also had a lung infection, x-rays showed.\n\nStill, she had ferried her husband on an earlier hospital visit by moped, which he fell off of once. That had been in the middle of the night.\n\n\"I just want to save his life,\" she said, as her husband sat slouched next to her in a waiting room chair.\n\nChina has locked down the city of Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, shutting down transportation and forbidding people from leaving. The region with nearly 60 million people, equivalent to the combined population of California and New York, is where the vast majority of the outbreak's confirmed cases and deaths have occurred.\n\nIn recent weeks, provinces outside of Hubei have sent medical teams to help treat those with the respiratory illnesses caused by the virus. State-owned construction companies and the Chinese military have rushed to build hospitals. Two of them are brand new, prefabricated structures assembled on the outskirts of the city.\n\nAt least 11 other public facilities are being converted into temporary hospitals, as local authorities seek to relieve the strain on the health system. At one convention center being turned into a field hospital, workers on Tuesday were fitting beds in the middle of the night, wiring electricity and sweeping away trash.\n\nThe efforts have yet to alleviate pressures on the overwhelmed health-care system, as the number of cases has continued to rise rapidly.\n\nHealth authorities said the coronavirus killed another 73 people in China on Thursday, matching Wednesday's single-day high and raising the death toll to 636. They also confirmed 3,143 new cases of infection, bringing the total to 31,161.\n\nAt Union Hospital, a line stretched out one door. More than two dozen people, clad in masks and winter coats, were waiting to get tested. Liang Xiu, 32, said she suffered from chest pain but believed she had gotten better because she was young.\n\nShe was saddened by the news of the death of a 33-year-old Wuhan ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang, who has been hailed as hero for warning early of the danger of the virus and for his own battle with an infection. He was young too, she noted. \"How did he not survive?\" she said.\n\nRelated article\n\nWhat We Know About the Coronavirus\n\nMs. Liang said she believed patients needed to rely on themselves rather than the government. \"They should have warned us earlier,\" she said. \"It wouldn't have been like this.\"\n\nBehind her, Xia Shengqi said he had bronchitis and had been coughing since early January, but didn't wear a mask on previous hospital visits because he didn't know about the virus. \"We didn't take it seriously before,\" said the 26-year-old Mr. Xia, who had been in line for more than an hour.\n\nMs. Liang asked why he waited until his fourth week of sickness to get tested. \"I thought the test was expensive before,\" Mr. Xia said. He recently heard the government made it free.\n\nAt Tongji Hospital campus, red tents served as a supply depot for several medical centers. Scores of unopened cardboard boxes were stacked there, but a worker said they still didn't have enough protective suits, goggles and shoe covers. \"Since they're one-time use, the usage is huge,\" he said.\n\nSome Wuhan hospitals had a shortage of both medical personnel and supplies, especially oxygen for patients in critical condition, said Peng Peng, dean of Wuhan Lung Hospital, at a Friday news conference.\n\nThe Chinese government has thanked both foreign countries and companies for medical assistance. European Union countries have already committed at least 12 tons of medical supplies to China after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang asked the bloc for assistance last weekend, while Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., China's largest online retailer, started what it calls a Green Channel initiative to fast-track delivery of medical supplies into affected areas.\n\nAt the Central Hospital of Wuhan, authorities had turned the emergency department into a ward to manage coronavirus patients. Outside, a man wearing a protective suit and sunglasses stood next to his 66-year-old mother, who was blowing her nose onto the ground. He said she was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Wednesday, but they were still waiting to get inside so his mother could get a second test. They needed to check whether his dad was sick too. Fearing he could also be infected, the man said he has been isolating himself at a different apartment from his wife and child.\n\nAround the corner, well-wishers had delivered flower bouquets to one entrance for Dr. Li, the Wuhan ophthalmologist who died at that hospital early Friday morning. A delivery man surnamed Guo who had gotten nearly a dozen orders came out after staying indoors since the Lunar New Year, feeling it was the only way to honor the doctor. \"His passing was so tragic,\" he said. A handwritten message on one of the bouquets read, \"Heroes don't die, thank you.\"\n\n-- Kersten Zhang contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com and Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"Saudi Arabia is pushing for a major, short-term oil production cut as it seeks to respond to the impact of China's deadly coronavirus on crude demand, according to OPEC officials.\n\n\u00a9 Stephen Strathdee / Getty\n\nRepresentatives of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are set to meet Tuesday and Wednesday to debate possible action after the outbreak in China, the world's largest oil consumer, led to the biggest monthly crude-price drop in 30 years.\n\nLoad Error\n\nUnder one scenario, Saudi Arabia, OPEC's kingpin, would lead a collective reduction of 500,000 barrels a day that would stand until the crisis is over, cartel officials said.\n\nAnother option being considered would involve a temporary cut of 1 million barrels a day by the Saudis to jolt oil markets, the officials said.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nOPEC and its allies are split over how to manage oil

The patient had no symptoms and was being quarantined in a hospital.\n\nGambling center Macau, whose casinos racked up revenue roughly six times that of the Las Vegas Strip last year, is closing casinos for 15 days because of the coronavirus, Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng said Tuesday. Two local residents confirmed to have the virus Tuesday worked for casinos, health authorities said. The city had 10 cases as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe Latest on the Coronavirus\n\nConfirmed cases topped 20,000. The death toll is at least 425. Macau is closing its casinos. Supermarkets in China are being warned against price gouging.\n\nThe Chinese special territory had previously restricted only entry to the casinos by people who had been to China's Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital.\n\nIn China, a member of the National Health Commission's group to study the virus, acknowledged in an interview with state broadcaster China Central television that resources in Wuhan weren't adequate to handle the high number of cases there. Jiang Rongmen said that was part of the reason there is a higher death rate in the city. The death rate from the virus is 4.9% in the city but 2.1% nationwide, according to the health commission.\n\nAnother official with the health commission sought to offer reassurance at a press conference on Tuesday. Most infected patients have only mild symptoms, Jiao Yahui said.\n\nStill, the list of local governments restricting movement also grew. Hangzhou, home to tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and the world's No. 1 maker of surveillance cameras, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, said it was closing all public places other than markets and pharmacies. It also joined other cities in allowing each household to send out only one person every two days for basic necessities, according to a government notice published Tuesday. Hangzhou has more than 100 confirmed cases of the virus.\n\nThe city of about 10 million people is a popular tourist destination about two hours' drive from Shanghai and the capital of Zhejiang province. Wenzhou, about 200 miles south in the same province, had previously imposed similar movement restrictions. Several other cities across China -- including Harbin, more than 1,500 miles north of Wuhan, with 63 confirmed cases -- introduced similar controls.\n\nHong Kong, a special territory that neighbors Macau, recorded its first death from the coronavirus, a 39-year-old man who had been to the central city of Wuhan in January. It was the second coronavirus death outside mainland China, following the death in the Philippines of a 44-year-old man from Wuhan on Saturday.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has faced calls from some politicians and medical professionals in the city to fully close the border with the mainland. The city, which has 18 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, is set to shut some of its busiest checkpoints with mainland China late Tuesday night, tightening the border for the second time since the outbreak began.\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Health reported six new cases, four of them resulting from local human-to-human transmission, but said there was no evidence of sustained community transmission. The city state, among the first countries to impose travel restrictions on people from mainland China, has more than 20 confirmed cases.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.K. upgraded its travel warning, telling citizens who were in China to leave if they were able. Previously, the advisory had applied only to Hubei. New Zealand issued a similar advisory.\n\nIndia said it had banned all Chinese citizens and others who had recently been in the virus-stricken country, from entering the country, and Taiwan said Tuesday that it would refuse entry starting Friday to foreigners who had been to mainland China in the past two weeks. Chinese nationals largely aren't permitted by their own government to travel to the self-ruling island as tourists.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Middle Seat: How to Handle Air Travel During Outbreak Outbreak a Major Test of China's System, Says Xi Jinping Officials Err on Side of Caution Tracking the Coronavirus The Economic Impact of Coronavirus, by the Numbers Coronavirus Closes China to the World, Straining Global Economy\n\nTaiwan also imposed limits on purchasing face masks, which are in short supply in the region as people try to protect themselves against infection. South Korea was set to implement a law on Wednesday that would punish hoarding protective masks with up to two years in prison and a fine of more than $40,000.\n\nThe Macau government's website had a page that updated every 15 minutes to track which stores had face masks in stock and how many.\n\nIn Japan, a cruise ship with about 3,700 people was quarantined in Yokohama, after a man who had been on the ship tested positive for the virus, said the ship's operator, Carnival Japan Inc. Quarantine officials were conducting checks on passengers.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates followed several other Middle Eastern countries, including Qatar and Iran, in restricting travel to China. Flights, except those going to Beijing, will be suspended indefinitely starting Wednesday, the aviation authority there said Monday.\n\nChinese stock markets steadied Tuesday, after plunging on the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year holiday, despite liquidity injections from the central bank and vows to support financial institutions. The People's Bank of China injected a further $71.2 billion of liquidity through reverse repurchase agreements into the financial system Tuesday, adding to the $171 billion injected Monday.\n\nThe benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed up 1.3% Tuesday, one day after falling 7.7% and notching its steepest one-day decline since August 2015.\n\nAccording to the state-run People's Daily newspaper, China has spent roughly $6.7 billion on epidemic prevention, with the majority going to patient treatment and subsidies for medical workers.\n\nHealth News in Your Inbox\n\nGet a curated weekly look at features, columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry.

They include Guangzhou and Shenzhen in the southern province of Guangdong, which has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in China, with 725.\n\nState media reported that Wuhan is setting up field hospitals inside a sports stadium and two exhibition halls. The transformation is expected to be finished as early as Tuesday night. The three hospitals will have a total of 3,400 beds for patients with mild symptoms, according to Xinhua News Agency.\n\n-- Joyu Wang, Grace Zhu, Yin Yijun, Jing Yang, Liyan Qi, Wenxin Fan, Miho Inada and Valentina Pop contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Capacity", "body": "Cargo companies fear bottlenecks for expedited shipments once factories resume production By Jennifer Smith Jennifer Smith The Wall Street Journal BiographyJennifer Smith @jensmithWSJ Jennifer.Smith@wsj.com Feb. 6, 2020 2:01 pm ET\n\nA steep reduction in airline services to China in response to the coronavirus outbreak is slashing trans-Pacific capacity for high-value, expedited goods that move as airfreight, and setting the stage for potential outbound cargo bottlenecks once Chinese factories resume production.\n\nDozens of U.S., European and Asian airlines have suspended service to mainland China, reducing capacity for goods such as electronics that often travel in the bellies of passenger planes and triggering a jump in freight shipping rates. Some airlines have also halted flights into Hong Kong, the world's busiest international air cargo hub.\n\nFreighter operators such as United Parcel Service Inc. and Cargolux Airlines International SA are scaling back scheduled flights to China, as production shutdowns stretch past the Lunar New Year holiday that ended last week.\n\n\"We are continuing to fly into and out of China, supporting demand where it exists from our customers,\" said Jim Mayer, a spokesman for UPS's airline unit. \"We are prepared to resume normal operations as soon as regular commercial demand returns.\"\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nCargo volumes are likely to pick up once factories reopen, which some are set to do next week. But several passenger airlines don't plan to resume service to China until the end of March or later. And it isn't clear how many workers may report for duty or whether local officials could extend closures depending on the course of the outbreak.\n\n\"The variables continue to change by the hour,\" said Neel Jones Shah, global head of airfreight for Flexport Inc., a technology-focused international freight forwarder. \"Passenger bellies represent about 45% of all the capacity in and out of China...we know that capacity is going to be gone.\"\n\nMr. Jones Shah said Flexport isn't scrambling for capacity right now because the production shutdown means there isn't much cargo to be shipped. But routing airfreight shipments into China, such as medical equipment and industrial goods, is \"getting a little tricky,\" he said, with rates up three or four times the usual price.\n\nMore From WSJ Logistics Report\n\nAirlines' China Cutbacks Amid Coronavirus Outbreak Squeeze Freight Capacity February 6, 2020 Coronavirus Hits Shipping as China Port Traffic Slides February 5, 2020 IKEA's Meatball Supply Chain Goes Digital January 31, 2020 Digital Freight Startup NEXT Trucking Lays Off 70 Employees January 29, 2020\n\nMore than 25,000 flights to, from or within China have been canceled because of the coronavirus, according to Resilience360, which monitors risk and disruptions across supply chains.\n\n\"The biggest risk is likely to come from congestion at air cargo terminals and warehouses due to inbound shipments for which delivery and pick-up services cannot currently be arranged. This is likely to cause increased storage costs,\" Resilience 360 wrote in a Feb. 5 report. \"Capacity shortages are most likely to occur for outbound shipments from Chengdu and Chongqing, which rely more heavily on passenger flights than hubs such as Shanghai.\"\n\nFreighter operations at Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Ltd. are continuing as normal \"save for temporary minor adjustments in schedule,\" Chief Executive WIlson Kwong said.\n\nHe said Hong Kong International Airport could become an alternative route for China shipments if \"the problems on the mainland lead to serious airfreight disruption.\"\n\nOnce production in China resumes, companies that usually transport goods by container ship may seek to move inventory to distribution centers by air to make up for lost time, said Mike Short, president of global forwarding, at C.H.
